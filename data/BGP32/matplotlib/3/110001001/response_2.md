The buggy function `_recache` in the `MarkerStyle` class is missing a proper implementation to handle the `_marker_function` attribute. Currently, it simply calls the function without checking its existence, which can lead to errors if the function is not defined.

To fix this bug, we need to ensure that `_marker_function` attribute is callable before invoking it. Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
# The declaration of the class containing the buggy function
class MarkerStyle():

    def _recache(self):
        if self._marker_function is not None and callable(self._marker_function):
            self._path = _empty_path
            self._transform = IdentityTransform()
            self._alt_path = None
            self._alt_transform = None
            self._snap_threshold = None
            self._joinstyle = 'round'
            self._capstyle = 'butt'
            self._filled = True
            self._marker_function()
```

By adding a check to ensure that `_marker_function` is not None and callable, we prevent the function from being called if it is not defined. This should fix the bug and prevent any errors related to calling a non-existent function.
