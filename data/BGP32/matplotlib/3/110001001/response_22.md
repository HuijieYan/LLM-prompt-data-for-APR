The issue in the buggy function is that the `_marker_function` attribute is being called without checking its existence. If `_marker_function` is `None`, it should not be called.

### Fix:
To fix the bug, modify the `_recache` function to check if `_marker_function` is not `None` before calling it.

Here is the corrected version of the `_recache` function:

```python
class MarkerStyle():
    
    def _recache(self):
        if self._marker_function is not None:
            self._path = _empty_path
            self._transform = IdentityTransform()
            self._alt_path = None
            self._alt_transform = None
            self._snap_threshold = None
            self._joinstyle = 'round'
            self._capstyle = 'butt'
            self._filled = True
            self._marker_function()
```

By adding the check before calling `_marker_function`, we ensure that it is only invoked when it exists, preventing any `NoneType` errors.
