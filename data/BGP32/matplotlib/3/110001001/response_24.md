### Analysis
The buggy function `_recache` initializes several variables and then calls the `_marker_function` without checking whether it is None or not. This can lead to an error if `_marker_function` is None.

### Bug Cause
The bug occurs because the function does not handle the case where `_marker_function` is None. This results in attempting to call a NoneType object.

### Fix
To fix the bug, we need to add a check before calling `_marker_function` to ensure that it is not None.

### Corrected Version
```python
class MarkerStyle():
    def _recache(self):
        if self._marker_function is not None:
            self._path = _empty_path
            self._transform = IdentityTransform()
            self._alt_path = None
            self._alt_transform = None
            self._snap_threshold = None
            self._joinstyle = 'round'
            self._capstyle = 'butt'
            self._filled = True
            self._marker_function()
```
