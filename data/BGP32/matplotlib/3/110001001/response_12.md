The bug in the `_recache` function is that it is trying to call `self._marker_function` without checking for its existence. This can lead to a `NoneType` object has no attribute error if `_marker_function` is not defined.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the `_recache` function to check if `_marker_function` is not `None` before calling it.

Here is the corrected version of the `_recache` function:

```python
    def _recache(self):
        if self._marker_function is not None:
            self._path = _empty_path
            self._transform = IdentityTransform()
            self._alt_path = None
            self._alt_transform = None
            self._snap_threshold = None
            self._joinstyle = 'round'
            self._capstyle = 'butt'
            self._filled = True
            self._marker_function()
```

With this modification, the function will only call `_marker_function` if it is defined, preventing any potential errors related to calling a `NoneType`.
