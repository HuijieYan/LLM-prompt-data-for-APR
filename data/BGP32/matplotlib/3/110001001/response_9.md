The bug in the `_recache` function lies in the line `self._marker_function()`, where a function is called without checking if it exists. This could lead to a `NoneType` object being called as a function, resulting in an error.

To fix this bug, we should add a conditional check to ensure that `_marker_function` is not `None` before calling it.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
# The relative path of the fixed file: lib/matplotlib/markers.py

# The declaration of the class containing the fixed function
class MarkerStyle():
    # the fixed _recache function
    def _recache(self):
        if self._marker_function is not None:
            self._path = _empty_path
            self._transform = IdentityTransform()
            self._alt_path = None
            self._alt_transform = None
            self._snap_threshold = None
            self._joinstyle = 'round'
            self._capstyle = 'butt'
            self._filled = True
            self._marker_function()
```

By adding the conditional check to ensure `_marker_function` is not `None` before calling it, we prevent the bug that arises from trying to call a `NoneType` object.
