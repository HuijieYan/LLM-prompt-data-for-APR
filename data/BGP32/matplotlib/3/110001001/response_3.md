### Bug Explanation
The buggy function `_recache` is supposed to update several internal variables of the `MarkerStyle` class based on the `_marker_function`. However, the function is missing the logic to assign values to these variables properly. It currently resets some variables to default values but does not set them based on any logic or input.

### Bug Fix
To fix this bug, we need to modify the `_recache` function to actually recache the values based on some logic or input. We can update the function to set the `_path`, `_transform`, `_alt_path`, `_alt_transform`, `_snap_threshold`, `_joinstyle`, `_capstyle`, and `_filled` variables based on the output of the `_marker_function`. Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
# The corrected version of the buggy function
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path, self._transform, self._alt_path, self._alt_transform, self._snap_threshold, self._joinstyle, self._capstyle, self._filled = self._marker_function()
```

This updated version assigns the values returned by the `_marker_function` to the corresponding internal variables of the `MarkerStyle` class.
