The bug in the `_recache` function lies in the line where `self._marker_function()` is called. This line tries to execute a potentially undefined function stored in the `_marker_function` attribute. If `_marker_function` is not defined, the program will raise an error.

To fix this bug, we need to ensure that `_marker_function` is defined before attempting to execute it. One approach is to check if `_marker_function` is not None before calling it.

Here is the corrected version of the `_recache` function:

```python
class MarkerStyle():

    def _recache(self):
        if self._marker_function is not None:  # Check if _marker_function is defined
            self._path = _empty_path
            self._transform = IdentityTransform()
            self._alt_path = None
            self._alt_transform = None
            self._snap_threshold = None
            self._joinstyle = 'round'
            self._capstyle = 'butt'
            self._filled = True
            self._marker_function()
```

With this fix, the function will only call `_marker_function` if it is defined, preventing any potential errors that may occur due to its undefined status.
