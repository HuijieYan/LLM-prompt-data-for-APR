### Explanation:
The buggy function `_recache` in the `MarkerStyle` class is supposed to recache the marker's properties. However, it is missing an initialization step for the `_marker_function` attribute, leading to a `NoneType` error when trying to call it.

### Bug Fix:
To fix this bug, we need to ensure that `_marker_function` is properly initialized before trying to call it. We can achieve this by checking if `_marker_function` is not `None` before invoking it.

### Corrected Version:
```python
class MarkerStyle():

    def _recache(self):
        if self._marker_function is not None:  # Check if _marker_function is not None
            self._path = _empty_path
            self._transform = IdentityTransform()
            self._alt_path = None
            self._alt_transform = None
            self._snap_threshold = None
            self._joinstyle = 'round'
            self._capstyle = 'butt'
            self._filled = True
            self._marker_function()
```
