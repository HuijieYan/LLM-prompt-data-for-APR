The bug in the `_recache` function is that it tries to call the `_marker_function` even if it is None, which can result in an AttributeError if `_marker_function` is not defined. 

To fix this bug, we can add a check to ensure that `_marker_function` is not None before calling it. Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
    def _recache(self):
        if self._marker_function is None:
            return
        self._path = _empty_path
        self._transform = IdentityTransform()
        self._alt_path = None
        self._alt_transform = None
        self._snap_threshold = None
        self._joinstyle = 'round'
        self._capstyle = 'butt'
        self._filled = True
        self._marker_function()
```

By adding this check, the function will only call `_marker_function` if it is not None, preventing any AttributeError from occurring.
