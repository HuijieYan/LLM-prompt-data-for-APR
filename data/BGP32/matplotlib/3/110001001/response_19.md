The buggy function `_recache` is supposed to update certain attributes of the `MarkerStyle` class based on the `_marker_function` attribute. However, there is an issue in the implementation where the `_marker_function` is called without any checks, potentially leading to errors if the function is not properly defined.

To fix this bug, we need to ensure that `_marker_function` is properly defined before calling it. We can add a check to validate if `_marker_function` exists before attempting to call it.

Here is the corrected version of the `_recache` function:

```python
# The declaration of the class containing the buggy function
class MarkerStyle():
    # Corrected version of the buggy function
    def _recache(self):
        if self._marker_function is None:
            return
        self._path = _empty_path
        self._transform = IdentityTransform()
        self._alt_path = None
        self._alt_transform = None
        self._snap_threshold = None
        self._joinstyle = 'round'
        self._capstyle = 'butt'
        self._filled = True
        if callable(self._marker_function):
            self._marker_function()
```

With this correction, the `_marker_function` will only be called if it is a callable attribute, preventing any potential errors related to undefined or improperly defined functions.
