### Explanation:
The buggy function `_recache` is supposed to reset various attributes of the `MarkerStyle` class to their default values before calling the `_marker_function`. However, it does not check if `_marker_function` is `None` before calling it, which can lead to potential errors.

### Bug:
The bug in the current implementation is that it directly calls `_marker_function` without checking if it is `None`, which can cause issues if `_marker_function` is not defined or assigned incorrectly.

### Fix:
To fix this bug, we should add a condition to check if `_marker_function` is not `None` before calling it. This will prevent errors and ensure that the function is only called when it is defined and valid.

### Corrected Version:
```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: lib/matplotlib/markers.py

# The declaration of the class containing the buggy function
class MarkerStyle():
    # this is the corrected function
    def _recache(self):
        if self._marker_function is not None:
            self._path = _empty_path
            self._transform = IdentityTransform()
            self._alt_path = None
            self._alt_transform = None
            self._snap_threshold = None
            self._joinstyle = 'round'
            self._capstyle = 'butt'
            self._filled = True
            self._marker_function()
``` 

By adding the `if self._marker_function is not None:` condition, we ensure that the `_marker_function` is only called when it is not `None`, avoiding potential errors.
