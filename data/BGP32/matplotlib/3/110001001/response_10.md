### Analysis
The `_recache` function is supposed to reset various attributes of the `MarkerStyle` class to default values if the `_marker_function` is not `None`. However, the function is missing some necessary logic to properly reset the `_marker_function`. This could lead to unexpected behavior or errors if the `_marker_function` is not correctly set.

### Bug Explanation
1. The `_marker_function` is checked for `None` before any reset operations, but there is no handling if `_marker_function` is not `None`.
2. If `_marker_function` is not `None`, the function is called without any parameters, but we don't know what the function does internally or if it actually needs any parameters to perform correctly.
3. The function should reset `_marker_function` to prevent further issues if it's not `None`.

### Bug Fix
To fix this bug, we should add logic to correctly handle resetting `_marker_function` and ensure that it's properly set to `None` after resetting.

### Corrected Version
```python
class MarkerStyle():
    def _recache(self):
        if self._marker_function is not None:
            self._marker_function = None  # Reset _marker_function
        self._path = _empty_path
        self._transform = IdentityTransform()
        self._alt_path = None
        self._alt_transform = None
        self._snap_threshold = None
        self._joinstyle = 'round'
        self._capstyle = 'butt'
        self._filled = True
``` 

In the corrected version, we first check if `_marker_function` is not `None`, then we reset it to `None`. This ensures that the function is properly set to `None` if it's not needed.
