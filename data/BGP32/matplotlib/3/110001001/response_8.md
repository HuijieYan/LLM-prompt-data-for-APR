### Bug Explanation
The bug in the `_recache` function lies in the line `self._marker_function()`. This line is attempting to call a function stored in the attribute `_marker_function` without checking if it actually exists or not. If `_marker_function` is not defined, this will result in a `TypeError` and the program will crash.

### Bug Fix
To fix this bug, we need to ensure that `_marker_function` exists before calling it. We can add a simple `if` condition to check if `_marker_function` is not `None` before attempting to call it. Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
class MarkerStyle():
    def _recache(self):
        if self._marker_function is not None:
            self._path = _empty_path
            self._transform = IdentityTransform()
            self._alt_path = None
            self._alt_transform = None
            self._snap_threshold = None
            self._joinstyle = 'round'
            self._capstyle = 'butt'
            self._filled = True
            self._marker_function()
``` 

With this modification, the function will only call `_marker_function` if it is not `None`, avoiding the `TypeError` and potential crash.
