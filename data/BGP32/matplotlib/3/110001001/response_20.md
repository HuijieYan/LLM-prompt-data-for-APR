### Explanation:
The bug in the `_recache` function is that it is trying to call `self._marker_function()` without checking if `self._marker_function` is actually a function. This can lead to an AttributeError if `self._marker_function` is not defined.

### Bug Fix:
To fix the bug, we need to add a check to ensure that `self._marker_function` is callable before attempting to call it. Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
    def _recache(self):
        if self._marker_function is not None and callable(self._marker_function):
            self._path = _empty_path
            self._transform = IdentityTransform()
            self._alt_path = None
            self._alt_transform = None
            self._snap_threshold = None
            self._joinstyle = 'round'
            self._capstyle = 'butt'
            self._filled = True
            self._marker_function()
```

By adding the check `if self._marker_function is not None and callable(self._marker_function):`, we ensure that we only call `self._marker_function()` if it is defined as a callable function. This will prevent any AttributeError from occurring.
