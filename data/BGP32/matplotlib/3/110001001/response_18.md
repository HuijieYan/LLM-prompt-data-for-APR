### Explanation:
The buggy function `_recache` is trying to call a marker function (`self._marker_function()`) without checking if it is defined, which can lead to a `NoneType` object error if `self._marker_function` is `None`.

### Bug:
The bug is caused by calling `self._marker_function()` without verifying if `self._marker_function` is defined.

### Strategy for fixing the bug:
To fix the bug, we need to add a condition to check if `self._marker_function` is not `None` before calling it.

### Corrected version of the function:

```python
class MarkerStyle():
    def _recache(self):
        if self._marker_function is not None:
            self._path = _empty_path
            self._transform = IdentityTransform()
            self._alt_path = None
            self._alt_transform = None
            self._snap_threshold = None
            self._joinstyle = 'round'
            self._capstyle = 'butt'
            self._filled = True
            self._marker_function()
``` 

By adding the `if self._marker_function is not None:` condition, we ensure that the marker function is only called when it is defined, preventing the `NoneType` object error.
