### Explanation
The `_recache` function is supposed to reset certain attributes of the `MarkerStyle` class to their default values. However, there is a crucial mistake in the line `self._marker_function()` where it is attempting to call a function that might not exist or might not be properly assigned.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the `_marker_function` attribute is properly assigned with a valid function. If it is not intended to exist or be called in the `_recache` function, we should remove that line entirely.

### Corrected Version of the Function
```python
class MarkerStyle():
    def _recache(self):
        if self._marker_function is not None:
            self._path = _empty_path
            self._transform = IdentityTransform()
            self._alt_path = None
            self._alt_transform = None
            self._snap_threshold = None
            self._joinstyle = 'round'
            self._capstyle = 'butt'
            self._filled = True
```
