### Bug Explanation
The `_recache` function in the `MarkerStyle` class is attempting to call the `_marker_function` without checking if it exists or not. This can lead to a `NoneType` object has no attribute error if `_marker_function` is not defined in the class. 

### Bug Fix
To fix this bug, we need to check if `_marker_function` is not None before calling it. Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
# The declaration of the class containing the corrected function
class MarkerStyle():
    def _recache(self):
        if self._marker_function is not None:
            self._path = _empty_path
            self._transform = IdentityTransform()
            self._alt_path = None
            self._alt_transform = None
            self._snap_threshold = None
            self._joinstyle = 'round'
            self._capstyle = 'butt'
            self._filled = True
            self._marker_function()
```

By adding the conditional check `if self._marker_function is not None:`, we ensure that `_marker_function` is valid before attempting to call it. This fix will prevent the `NoneType` object has no attribute error.
