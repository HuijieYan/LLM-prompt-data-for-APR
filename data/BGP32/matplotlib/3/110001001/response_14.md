The bug in the `_recache` function is that it tries to call a function stored in the attribute `_marker_function` without checking if it is defined or callable. This can lead to a `TypeError` if `_marker_function` is not set to a valid function.

To fix this bug, we need to add a check to ensure that `_marker_function` is callable before attempting to call it.

Here is the corrected version of the `_recache` function:

```python
class MarkerStyle():
    def _recache(self):
        if self._marker_function is not None and callable(self._marker_function):
            self._path = _empty_path
            self._transform = IdentityTransform()
            self._alt_path = None
            self._alt_transform = None
            self._snap_threshold = None
            self._joinstyle = 'round'
            self._capstyle = 'butt'
            self._filled = True
            self._marker_function()
``` 

By adding the check `if self._marker_function is not None and callable(self._marker_function):`, we ensure that `_marker_function` is defined and callable before trying to execute it, avoiding potential `TypeError` exceptions.
