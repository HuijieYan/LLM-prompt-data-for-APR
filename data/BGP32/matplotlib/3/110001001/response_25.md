The bug in the `_recache` function lies in the line `self._marker_function()` where it is attempting to call a function stored in the `_marker_function` attribute without checking if it exists or not. This is leading to a `NoneType` object being called as a function, causing a runtime error.

To fix this bug, we need to first check if the `_marker_function` attribute is not `None` before attempting to call it.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is not None:
        self._path = _empty_path
        self._transform = IdentityTransform()
        self._alt_path = None
        self._alt_transform = None
        self._snap_threshold = None
        self._joinstyle = 'round'
        self._capstyle = 'butt'
        self._filled = True
        self._marker_function()
```

With this fix, the function will only call `_marker_function()` if it is not `None`, preventing any runtime errors.
