### Analysis
The `_recache` function in the `MarkerStyle` class is supposed to update several attributes based on the current state, but it appears that there is a missing implementation for `_marker_function`, which is expected to be a method that should be called when it is not `None`. As a result, the function is not properly updating some of the attributes.

### Bug Cause
The bug is caused by the missing implementation or assignment for the `_marker_function` method, leading to an incomplete update of the attributes in the `_recache` function.

### Proposed Fix
To fix the bug, we need to define or assign a correct `_marker_function` method that will properly update the attributes in the `_recache` function.

### Corrected Version
```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: lib/matplotlib/markers.py

# The declaration of the class containing the corrected function
class MarkerStyle():
    def _marker_function(self):
        # Add implementation logic for updating attributes
        pass

    def _recache(self):
        if self._marker_function is not None:
            self._path = _empty_path
            self._transform = IdentityTransform()
            self._alt_path = None
            self._alt_transform = None
            self._snap_threshold = None
            self._joinstyle = 'round'
            self._capstyle = 'butt'
            self._filled = True
            self._marker_function()
```

In the corrected version, we have added a placeholder `_marker_function` method that can be extended with the necessary logic to update the attributes in the `_recache` function.
