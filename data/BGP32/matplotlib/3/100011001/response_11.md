### Analysis
The failing test is checking whether the `is_filled()` method of the `MarkerStyle` object returns `False`, but it is currently returning `True`. This indicates that the `self._filled` attribute is not being set correctly in the `_recache` function.

Looking at the code of the `_recache` function, we can see that `self._filled` is always set to `True` unconditionally. This is causing the `is_filled()` method to return `True` regardless of the actual fillstyle set.

### Bug Fix
To fix this issue, we need to update the `_recache` function to set the `self._filled` attribute based on the fillstyle specified. If the fillstyle is set to `'none'`, then `self._filled` should be set to `False`.

Here is the corrected version of the `_recache` function:
```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    self._filled = self._fillstyle != 'none'
    self._marker_function()
```

By updating the `_recache` function to consider the fillstyle when setting the `self._filled` attribute, the `is_filled()` method should now return the correct value based on the fillstyle specified.
