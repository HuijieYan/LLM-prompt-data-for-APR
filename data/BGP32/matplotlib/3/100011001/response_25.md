### Bug Explanation
The failing test is checking the `is_filled` method of the `MarkerStyle` object, which is not implemented correctly in the buggy function `_recache`. The `_recache` function sets `self._filled = True` unconditionally, which does not allow for changing the filled status based on the `fillstyle` parameter provided during the initialization of the `MarkerStyle` object. This causes the `is_filled` method to always return `True`, leading to the failing test assertion.

### Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the `self._filled` attribute is properly set based on the `fillstyle` parameter provided during the initialization of the `MarkerStyle` object. This will allow the `is_filled` method to return the correct filled status based on the `fillstyle`.

### Corrected Version
```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    self._filled = self.get_fillstyle() != 'none'
    self._marker_function()
```

By updating the `_filled` attribute based on the `fillstyle` parameter, we ensure that the filled status is correctly determined and returned by the `is_filled` method, resolving the bug.
