### Bug Analysis
The failing test is checking the `is_filled()` method of the `MarkerStyle` class. The bug seems to be related to the `is_filled()` method not returning the expected value, which leads to the test failure.

Looking at the buggy function `_recache()`, it initializes the `_filled` attribute as `True`. If the `is_filled()` method is not correctly implemented to return the value of the `_filled` attribute, this could be the cause of the bug.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the `is_filled()` method correctly returns the `_filled` attribute's value.

### The corrected version of the function:
```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    self._filled = True
    if callable(self._marker_function):
        self._marker_function()
```

By ensuring that the `_marker_function` is callable before invoking it, we can prevent potential issues with the function. This should help resolve the bug and ensure that the `is_filled()` method returns the correct value.
