### Analysis
The failing test is checking if the marker is filled or not. The bug seems to be related to the `_filled` attribute not being properly set or checked within the `_recache` function. The error message indicates that the assertion `assert not marker_style.is_filled()` fails, meaning that the `is_filled` method is returning `True` when it should return `False` for the given marker style.

### Bug Cause
1. The `_filled` attribute is set to `True` by default in the `_recache` function, which may not reflect the actual fillstyle set in the `MarkerStyle` object. This causes the `is_filled` method to return `True` even if the fillstyle is set to `'none'`.
   
### Bug Fix
Update the `_filled` attribute according to the fillstyle set in the `MarkerStyle` object. If the fillstyle is `'none'`, then `_filled` should be set to `False` in the `_recache` function.

### Corrected Version
```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    self._filled = self.get_fillstyle() != 'none'  # Update _filled based on fillstyle
    self._marker_function()
``` 

By updating the `_filled` attribute based on the fillstyle set in the `MarkerStyle` object, the corrected version should pass the failing test for checking if the marker is filled or not. It ensures that the marker's filled status is correctly reflected based on the fillstyle set.
