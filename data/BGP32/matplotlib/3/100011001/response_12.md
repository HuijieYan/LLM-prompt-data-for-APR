### Bug Explanation
The failing test is asserting that `marker_style.is_filled()` should return `False`, but it is currently returning `True`. This discrepancy suggests that the `_filled` attribute in the `_recache` function is not being set correctly.

### Bug Location
The bug is likely located in the `_recache` function where the `_filled` attribute is set to `True` unconditionally.

### Bug Fix
To fix the bug, we need to correctly set the `_filled` attribute based on the value of `fillstyle` provided in the `MarkerStyle` class initialization.

### Corrected Version
```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    self._filled = self.get_fillstyle() != 'none'
    self._marker_function()
```

By correcting the `_filled` assignment to be based on the value of `fillstyle`, we ensure that the assertion in the failing test will pass successfully.
