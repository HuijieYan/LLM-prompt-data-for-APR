### Analysis
The error message indicates that the `is_filled` method is returning `True`, which is not expected. This implies that the `_filled` attribute is not being properly set to `False` when the fillstyle is set to `'none'`.

### Bug Cause
The `_recache` function sets `_filled` to `True` unconditionally, which causes the `is_filled` method to return `True` even when the fillstyle is `'none'`.

### Fix Strategy
We need to ensure that the `_filled` attribute is correctly set based on the fillstyle provided when initializing the `MarkerStyle` instance.

### Corrected Version
```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    # Set filled based on the fillstyle
    self._filled = self.get_fillstyle() != 'none'
    self._marker_function()
``` 

By setting `_filled` based on the fillstyle, the corrected version should now properly reflect the fillstyle when checking if the marker is filled.
