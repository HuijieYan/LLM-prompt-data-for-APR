### Explanation
The failing test is checking if the `MarkerStyle` instance is not filled, but it is returning `True`, indicating that it is filled. The issue likely stems from the `_recache` function where the `_filled` attribute is being set to `True` unconditionally.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the `_filled` attribute is set based on the `fillstyle` parameter passed to the `MarkerStyle` class constructor.

### The corrected version of the function
```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    self._filled = self.fillstyle != 'none'
    self._marker_function()
``` 

By updating the `_filled` attribute based on the `fillstyle` parameter, we ensure that the correct filled status is maintained. This should resolve the issue and make the test pass.
