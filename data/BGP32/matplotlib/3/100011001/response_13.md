### Bug Explanation

The `is_filled()` method for the `MarkerStyle` class is returning `True` when it should not be, as indicated by the failing test. The `_recache()` function sets `self._filled` to `True`, which is causing the `is_filled()` method to return `True` incorrectly.

### Bug Fix

To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the `self._filled` attribute is set correctly in the `_recache()` function. We should set it based on the `fillstyle` specified in the `MarkerStyle` class constructor.

### Corrected Version

```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    self._filled = self._fillstyle != 'none'  # Set filled based on fillstyle
    self._marker_function()
```

By updating the `_recache()` function to set `self._filled` based on the `fillstyle` attribute, the `is_filled()` method should return the correct value as per the expected behavior.
