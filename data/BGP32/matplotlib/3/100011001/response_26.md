### Bug Explanation
The error message indicates that the `is_filled` method of the `MarkerStyle` object is returning `True` when it should be returning `False`. This suggests that the `_filled` attribute of the `MarkerStyle` object is not being set correctly in the `_recache` method.

Looking at the buggy `_recache` function, we see that the `_filled` attribute is being set to `True` unconditionally. This means that regardless of the actual fillstyle specified, `_filled` is always set to `True`, causing the `is_filled` method to return `True` incorrectly.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to correctly set the `_filled` attribute based on the fillstyle specified when creating the `MarkerStyle` object. This can be done by checking the `fillstyle` parameter in the `MarkerStyle` constructor and setting `_filled` accordingly in the `_recache` method.

### Corrected Version
Here is the corrected version of the `_recache` function:

```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    self._filled = self.fillstyle != 'none'
    self._marker_function()
```

By checking the `fillstyle` attribute in the constructor and setting `_filled` accordingly, we ensure that the `is_filled` method returns the correct value based on the specified fillstyle. This fix should make the failing test pass successfully.
