The buggy function `_recache` is failing to correctly set the `_filled` attribute to `False`, resulting in the `is_filled()` method returning `True` when it should return `False`. This is why the assertion `assert not marker_style.is_filled()` is failing in the test.

To fix this bug, we need to update the `_recache` function to ensure that `_filled` is set to `False` when the fill style is set to `'none'`.

Here is the corrected version of the `_recache` function:

```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    self._filled = self._fillstyle != 'none'
    self._marker_function()
```

By setting `_filled` based on the fill style, we ensure that the `is_filled()` method returns the correct value based on the fill style chosen in the marker style.

This correction should resolve the failing test for `marker_style` with fill style set to `'none'`.
