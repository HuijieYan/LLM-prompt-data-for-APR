### Bug Explanation
The failing test is expecting the `is_filled()` method of the `MarkerStyle` object to return `False`, but it is currently returning `True`. This behavior indicates that the `_recache` function is setting `_filled` to `True`, causing the `is_filled()` method to return `True`.

### Bug Location
The bug is located in the `_recache()` function where `_filled` is set to `True` by default.

### Bug Fix
To fix the bug, we need to set `_filled` based on the value of `fillstyle` provided during the initialization of `MarkerStyle`. If the `fillstyle` is `'none'`, then `_filled` should be set to `False`. 

Here is the corrected version of the `_recache()` function:

```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    self._filled = False if self.get_fillstyle() == 'none' else True
    self._marker_function()
```

This fix ensures that the `_filled` attribute is set based on the provided `fillstyle`, allowing the `is_filled()` method to return the correct value.
