### Analysis
The error message indicates that the assertion `assert not marker_style.is_filled()` failed, suggesting that the `is_filled()` method is returning `True` when it should return `False`.

Looking at the `_recache` function, it sets `self._filled = True`, which is incorrect as the expected behavior based on the failing test is that `fillstyle='none'` should result in `is_filled()` returning `False`.

### Bug
The bug lies in the initialization of `self._filled` to `True` in the `_recache` function while the intended behavior based on the failing test is to have it set according to the `fillstyle` property.

### Fix
Update the `_recache` function to set `self._filled` based on the provided `fillstyle` property.

### Corrected Version
```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    self._filled = self.get_fillstyle() != 'none'
    self._marker_function()
```
