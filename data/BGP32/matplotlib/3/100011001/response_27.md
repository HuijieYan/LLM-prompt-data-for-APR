### Analysis
The failing test is asserting that `marker_style.is_filled()` should return `False`. However, the buggy function sets the `_filled` attribute to `True` no matter what, causing the test to fail.

### Bug Cause
The bug is caused by the `_filled` attribute always being set to `True` inside the `_recache` function, regardless of the `fillstyle` value provided when creating the `MarkerStyle` object.

### Fix
To fix the bug, we need to modify the `_recache` function to consider the `fillstyle` attribute when setting the `_filled` attribute.

### Corrected Version
```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    self._filled = self._fillstyle != 'none'
    self._marker_function()
``` 

By updating the `_filled` attribute based on the `fillstyle`, the corrected version of the function now considers the fill style properly. This should resolve the issue identified by the failing test.
