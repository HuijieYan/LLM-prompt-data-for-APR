### Analysis
The error message indicates that the method `is_filled()` is not returning the expected value. This suggests that the `_filled` attribute is not being set correctly within the `_recache` method.

Looking at the variables right before the return in the buggy function:
- `self._filled` is set to `True`, which should indicate that the marker is filled.
- The `_marker_function` is called at the end, which should potentially modify the `_filled` attribute based on the marker style.

### Bug
The bug here is that the `_filled` attribute is being set to `True` before calling the `_marker_function`. If the `_marker_function` actually modifies the `_filled` attribute based on the marker style, setting it to `True` at the beginning of the `_recache` method is incorrect.

### Fix
To fix this bug, we should set `_filled` based on the marker style within the `_marker_function` instead of setting it to `True` upfront.

### Corrected Version
```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    self._filled = None  # Set to None initially
    self._marker_function()  # Call the marker function to set fill style
``` 

By setting `_filled` to `None` initially and relying on the `_marker_function` to determine the appropriate fill style, we ensure that the correct fill state is applied based on the marker style.
