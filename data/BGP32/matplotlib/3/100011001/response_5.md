### Bug Analysis
The error message is indicating that the `is_filled()` method is returning `True`, which is causing the test to fail. This suggests that the `_filled` attribute is not being set correctly in the `_recache` function, leading to incorrect behavior when calling `is_filled()`.

The `_filled` attribute is set to `True` in the `_recache` function, but the bug might be related to the initialization of the `MarkerStyle` object when setting the `fillstyle` to `'none'`. It seems that the fillstyle is not correctly affecting the `_filled` attribute, causing the `is_filled()` method to return `True`.

### Bug Fix
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the `_filled` attribute is correctly determined based on the `fillstyle` specified during the initialization of the `MarkerStyle` object. We can update the `_recache` function to set the `_filled` attribute based on the `fillstyle`.

Here is the corrected version of the `_recache` function:

```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    
    if self.get_fillstyle() == 'none':
        self._filled = False
    else:
        self._filled = True
        
    self._marker_function()
```

By updating the `_recache` function to correctly set the `_filled` attribute based on the `fillstyle`, we can fix the bug.
