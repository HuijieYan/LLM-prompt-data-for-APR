### Analysis
The failing test is trying to assert that `marker_style.is_filled()` should return `False`, but the actual behavior is not as expected. Looking at the `_recache` function, we can see that the `_filled` attribute is always set to `True`, which is causing the test to fail.

### Bug Cause
The `_filled` attribute is always initialized to `True` in the `_recache` function, regardless of the `fillstyle` provided. This causes the `is_filled()` method to always return `True` even if the `fillstyle` is set to `'none'`.

### Fix
We need to update the `_filled` attribute based on the `fillstyle` provided when creating the `MarkerStyle`. If the `fillstyle` is set to `'none'`, we should set `_filled` to `False` in the `_recache` function.

### Corrected Version
```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: lib/matplotlib/markers.py

# Corrected version of the buggy function
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    self._filled = self.get_fillstyle() != 'none'
    self._marker_function()
```

By updating the `_filled` attribute in the `_recache` function based on the `fillstyle`, the corrected version should now pass the failing test.
