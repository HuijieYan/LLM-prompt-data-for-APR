### Analysis
The failing test is checking the `is_filled` method of the `MarkerStyle` object and expecting it to return `False`, but it is returning `True` instead. This indicates that the `_filled` attribute of the `MarkerStyle` object is not being set correctly in the `_recache` function.

Looking at the `_recache` function, we can see that `_filled` is being set to `True` unconditionally. This is incorrect because the `MarkerStyle` object can have different fill styles (e.g., 'none') where `_filled` should be `False`.

### Bug Fix Strategy
We need to update the `_recache` function to set the `_filled` attribute based on the fill style specified in the `MarkerStyle` object. This will allow the `is_filled` method to return the correct value based on the fill style.

### Corrected Version
```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    
    if self.get_fillstyle() == 'none':
        self._filled = False
    else:
        self._filled = True
    
    self._marker_function()
``` 

In the corrected version, we check the fill style of the `MarkerStyle` object using the `get_fillstyle` method and set the `_filled` attribute accordingly. This will ensure that the `is_filled` method returns the correct value based on the fill style specified.
