### Identified Bug:
The buggy function `_recache` is not updating the `_filled` attribute according to the provided `MarkerStyle` object.

### Bug Explanation:
The failing test `assert not marker_style.is_filled()` indicates that the `is_filled` method of `MarkerStyle` should return `False`, but it is not returning as expected. The `_recache` function is supposed to handle the `_filled` attribute, but it seems that it is not updating it properly.

### Bug Fix:
To fix the bug, we need to update the `_filled` attribute based on the `fillstyle` parameter passed in the `MarkerStyle` object. We can modify the `_recache` function to set `_filled` accordingly. 

Here's the corrected version of the `_recache` function:
```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    self._filled = self.get_fillstyle() != 'none'
    self._marker_function()
```

By updating the `_filled` attribute based on the `fillstyle` parameter, the function should now correctly handle the filling of markers.
