### Explanation
From the error message and runtime values provided, we can see that the `is_filled` method is returning `True`, which is causing the test to fail. This indicates that the marker is being considered as filled when it should not be filled.

### Bug in the code
The bug lies in the `_recache` function where it sets `self._filled = True`. This assignment is incorrect for markers that need to be empty or unfilled.

### Fix strategy
To fix this bug, we need to update the `_recache` function to handle cases where the marker should not be filled. We can introduce a new parameter to determine the fill status of the marker and set `self._filled` accordingly.

### Corrected version
```python
def _recache(self, filled=True):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    self._filled = filled
    self._marker_function()
```

By introducing the `filled` parameter in the `_recache` function, we can control whether the marker should be considered filled or not. This way, we can fix the issue where markers that should not be filled are incorrectly marked as filled.
