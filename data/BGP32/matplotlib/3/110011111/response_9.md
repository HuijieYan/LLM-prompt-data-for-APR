To fix the bug in the `_recache` function of the `MarkerStyle` class, we need to make sure that the `_filled` variable is correctly set based on the `fillstyle` parameter. The bug is causing the `is_filled` method to return `True` when the expected behavior is `False` if `fillstyle='none'`.

Here is the corrected version of the `_recache` function:

```python
# The corrected version of the _recache function
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return

    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    self._filled = self.get_fillstyle() != 'none'
    self._marker_function()
```

By updating the `_filled` variable based on the `fillstyle` parameter, the bug causing the incorrect behavior will be fixed. This change ensures that the `is_filled` method will return the expected value when `fillstyle='none'`.

With this corrected version of the function, the failing test related to the marker fillstyle issue should pass successfully, and the markers should appear hollow when `fillstyle='none'` is set.

This fix addresses the reported issue on GitHub where markers were not hollow when using `ax.scatter()` and setting `markers.MarkerStyle()` with `fillstyle='none'`. The corrected function will now provide the expected behavior in such cases.
