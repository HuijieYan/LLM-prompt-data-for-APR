### Analysis
1. The `MarkerStyle` class has a `_recache` method that is intended to reinitialize marker styles. The failing test is checking if a marker with `'fillstyle='none'` is rendered correctly as hollow, but it fails to do so.
   
2. The error occurs because the `_recache` method sets the `_filled` attribute to `True` unconditionally, which causes the markers to be filled even when `fillstyle='none'` is specified.

### Bug Cause
The bug is caused by setting the `_filled` attribute to `True` unconditionally in the `_recache` method, which overrides the desired hollow behavior when `fillstyle='none'` is specified.

### Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, modify the `_recache` method to reflect the correct value of the `_filled` attribute based on the specified `fillstyle`.

### Corrected Version
```python
class MarkerStyle:
    def __init__(self, marker=None, fillstyle=None):
        self._marker_function = None
        self._fillstyle = fillstyle
        # initialize other attributes
        
    def _recache(self):
        if self._marker_function is None:
            return
        self._path = _empty_path
        self._transform = IdentityTransform()
        self._alt_path = None
        self._alt_transform = None
        self._snap_threshold = None
        self._joinstyle = 'round'
        self._capstyle = 'butt'
        if self._fillstyle == 'none':
            self._filled = False
        else:
            self._filled = True
        self._marker_function()
```

By modifying the `_recache` method to correctly set the `_filled` attribute based on the `fillstyle`, the markers will render as hollow when `fillstyle='none'` is specified.
