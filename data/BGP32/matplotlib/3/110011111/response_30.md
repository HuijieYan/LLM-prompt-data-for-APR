## Analysis
1. **Buggy Function and Class Relationship**: The `_recache` function is a method of the `MarkerStyle` class. It aims to update certain attributes based on the marker function. Based on the failing test, the issue seems to be related to setting the `_filled` attribute correctly when the `fillstyle` is set to `'none'`.
   
2. **Error Location**: The bug seems to be in the condition where the `_filled` attribute is set. Since the condition checking for the marker function is not clearly defined in the provided function, it might be leading to unexpected behavior.

3. **Bug Cause**:
    - The failing test involves the `MarkerStyle` object with a marker of `'o'` and `fillstyle` set to `'none'`.
    - The expected behavior is for the marker to be hollow (`_filled` is `False`), but the actual behavior suggests that `_filled` is `True`, which contradicts the expected outcome.
    - This inconsistency could be due to the incorrect handling of the `fillstyle` parameter inside the `_recache` function. The functionality to check for a specific `fillstyle` value and set `_filled` accordingly is likely missing.

4. **Bug Fix Strategy**:
    - To fix this bug, you need to add a check for the `fillstyle` parameter within the `_recache` function before setting the `_filled` attribute.
    - If the `fillstyle` is `'none'`, `_filled` should be set to `False` to make the marker hollow.
  
5. **Corrected Version**:

```python
class MarkerStyle():
    def _recache(self):
        if self._marker_function is None:
            return
        self._path = _empty_path
        self._transform = IdentityTransform()
        self._alt_path = None
        self._alt_transform = None
        self._snap_threshold = None
        self._joinstyle = 'round'
        self._capstyle = 'butt'
        
        # Check fillstyle and set _filled accordingly
        if self._fillstyle and self._fillstyle.lower() == 'none':
            self._filled = False
        else:
            self._filled = True
            
        self._marker_function()
```

This corrected version includes the additional check for `fillstyle` to correctly set the `_filled` attribute based on the provided `fillstyle` value. This fix should resolve the issue reported on GitHub and pass the failing test scenario.
