## Analysis
1. The buggy function `_recache` in the `MarkerStyle` class is not correctly handling the `fillstyle` attribute based on the provided test case.
2. In the failing test, it is expected that when `fillstyle='none'`, the marker should be hollow (not filled). However, the function does not correctly update the `_filled` attribute based on the `fillstyle` value.
3. The error message indicates that when the `is_filled` method is called on a `MarkerStyle` object with `fillstyle='none'`, it returns `True`, which is incorrect. This implies that the `_filled` attribute is not being properly set to `False` when `fillstyle='none'`. The expected behavior should be for `is_filled` to return `False` in this case.
4. We need to modify the `_recache` function to correctly handle the `fillstyle` attribute and update the `_filled` attribute accordingly.

## Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the `_filled` attribute is updated appropriately based on the `fillstyle` parameter. When `fillstyle='none'`, the marker should be considered as not filled (`_filled = False`). We can achieve this by adding a conditional check in the `_recache` function to update the `_filled` attribute based on the `fillstyle` value.

## Corrected Version
```python
class MarkerStyle:
    def _recache(self):
        if self._marker_function is None:
            return
        
        # Update _filled attribute based on fillstyle
        if self._fillstyle == 'none':
            self._filled = False
        else:
            self._filled = True
        
        # Other attribute assignments remain the same
        self._path = _empty_path
        self._transform = IdentityTransform()
        self._alt_path = None
        self._alt_transform = None
        self._snap_threshold = None
        self._joinstyle = 'round'
        self._capstyle = 'butt'
        
        self._marker_function()
```

By updating the `MarkerStyle` class's `_recache` method with the corrected logic to handle the `fillstyle` attribute and update the `_filled` attribute accordingly, the issue should be resolved. The corrected version will now correctly handle the marker fillstyle based on the provided test case.
