To fix the buggy function `_recache` in the `MarkerStyle` class, we need to address the issue where the `_filled` attribute is always set to `True`, even when the `fillstyle` is set to `'none'`. This causes the `is_filled()` method to return `True` incorrectly.

Here is the corrected version of the `_recache` function:

```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    self._filled = self._fillstyle != 'none'
    self._marker_function()
```

By updating the `_filled` attribute based on the value of `_fillstyle`, we ensure that when `fillstyle` is set to `'none'`, `_filled` will be `False`.

This correction aligns with the expected behavior in the failing test case and also resolves the issue reported on GitHub, where setting `fillstyle='none'` should result in hollow markers.

With this fix, the `is_filled()` method should now return the correct value based on the `fillstyle` setting, allowing the scatter plot to display markers as desired.
