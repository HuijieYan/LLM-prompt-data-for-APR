## Correction:

```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: lib/matplotlib/markers.py

# The corrected version of the class with the buggy function
class MarkerStyle():
    # The corrected _recache function
    def _recache(self):
        if self._marker_function is None:
            return
        self._path = IdentityTransform().transform_path(_empty_path)
        self._transform = IdentityTransform()
        self._alt_path = None
        self._alt_transform = None
        self._snap_threshold = None
        self._joinstyle = 'round'
        self._capstyle = 'butt'

        # Check if fillstyle is 'none' to set filled accordingly
        if self._fillstyle == 'none':
            self._filled = False
        else:
            self._filled = True
        self._marker_function()
```

Explanation:
- The bug was identified in the original `_recache()` function where the `_filled` attribute was always set to `True`, regardless of the `fillstyle` parameter. This caused the issue of markers not appearing hollow when `fillstyle='none'`.
- The corrected version now includes a condition to check if `fillstyle` is 'none' and set the `_filled` attribute accordingly to make the markers hollow as intended.
- By adding this condition, the bug causing the markers not to be hollow is fixed, and the corrected version should now pass the failing test and address the GitHub issue reported.
