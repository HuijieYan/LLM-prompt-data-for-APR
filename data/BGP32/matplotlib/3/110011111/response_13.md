### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_recache` in the `MarkerStyle` class is intended to update the marker style parameters. However, the bug occurs in setting the `_filled` attribute to `True` unconditionally, regardless of the fillstyle parameter.
2. The failing test indicates that the expected behavior is for the marker to be hollow when `fillstyle='none'`, which is not being achieved due to the bug in `_recache`.
3. In the runtime state within the buggy function, the `_filled` attribute is set to `True` regardless of the fillstyle value, causing the markers not to appear hollow, leading to the failed test assertion.
4. To fix the bug, it is necessary to adjust the `_filled` attribute based on the `fillstyle` parameter to achieve the expected behavior.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Update the logic within the `_recache` function to set the `_filled` attribute based on the `fillstyle` parameter value.
2. When `fillstyle='none'`, set `_filled` to `False` to ensure the markers are hollow as intended.

### Corrected Version:
```python
class MarkerStyle:
    def _recache(self):
        if self._marker_function is None:
            return
        self._path = _empty_path
        self._transform = IdentityTransform()
        self._alt_path = None
        self._alt_transform = None
        self._snap_threshold = None
        self._joinstyle = 'round'
        self._capstyle = 'butt'
        
        if self._fillstyle == 'none':
            self._filled = False
        else:
            self._filled = True
        
        self._marker_function()
```

After applying this fix and running the failing test, the `assert not marker_style.is_filled()` assertion should pass, indicating that the markers are now hollow when `fillstyle='none'`.
