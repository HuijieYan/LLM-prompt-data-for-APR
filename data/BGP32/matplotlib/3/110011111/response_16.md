## Analysis
1. The buggy function `_recache` is responsible for updating the internal state of the `MarkerStyle` class. It sets default values for several attributes and calls the `_marker_function`.
2. The failing test is checking if the marker is correctly identified as not filled when the `fillstyle` is set to `'none'`, but the buggy function sets `_filled` to `True` unconditionally.
3. The expected behavior is that when `fillstyle` is `'none'`, the marker should be hollow (not filled). The failing test indicates that this condition is not being met due to `_filled` always being set to `True`.
4. To fix the bug, we need to update `_filled` based on the `fillstyle` parameter.

## Bug Fix
```python
class MarkerStyle():
    def _recache(self):
        if self._marker_function is None:
            return
        self._path = _empty_path
        self._transform = IdentityTransform()
        self._alt_path = None
        self._alt_transform = None
        self._snap_threshold = None
        self._joinstyle = 'round'
        self._capstyle = 'butt'
        
        # Set _filled attribute based on fillstyle
        self._filled = self._fillstyle != 'none'
        
        self._marker_function()
```

By updating the `_filled` attribute based on the `fillstyle` parameter, the corrected version of the `_recache` function will correctly represent whether the marker should be filled or not.
