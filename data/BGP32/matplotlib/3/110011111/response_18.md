To fix the bug in the `_recache` method of the `MarkerStyle` class, we need to ensure that the `_filled` attribute is correctly set based on the `fillstyle` parameter provided during the initialization of the `MarkerStyle` object. The current implementation always sets `_filled` to `True`, which is causing the test to fail.

Here is the corrected version of the `_recache` method:

```python
class MarkerStyle():
    
    def __init__(self, marker, fillstyle=None):
        self._marker = marker
        self._fillstyle = fillstyle
        self._marker_function = None
        self._recache()
        
    def _recache(self):
        if self._marker_function is None:
            return
        self._path = _empty_path
        self._transform = IdentityTransform()
        self._alt_path = None
        self._alt_transform = None
        self._snap_threshold = None
        self._joinstyle = 'round'
        self._capstyle = 'butt'

        if self._fillstyle == 'none':
            self._filled = False
        else:
            self._filled = True

        self._marker_function()
```

In the corrected version, we added a conditional check to set the `_filled` attribute based on the `fillstyle` parameter. If `fillstyle` is 'none', `_filled` is set to `False`, indicating that the marker should be hollow. Otherwise, `_filled` is set to `True` as before.

This correction should resolve the failing test case and also address the issue reported on GitHub where markers were not appearing hollow when `fillstyle` was set to 'none'.
