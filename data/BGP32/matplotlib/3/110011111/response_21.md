To fix the bug in the `_recache` function of the `MarkerStyle` class, we need to update the `_filled` attribute based on the `fillstyle` parameter provided during initialization. If the `fillstyle` is set to `'none'`, then `_filled` should be set to `False`.

Here is the corrected version of the `_recache` function:

```python
class MarkerStyle():
    def _recache(self):
        if self._marker_function is None:
            return
        self._path = _empty_path
        self._transform = IdentityTransform()
        self._alt_path = None
        self._alt_transform = None
        self._snap_threshold = None
        self._joinstyle = 'round'
        self._capstyle = 'butt'
        self._filled = True if self._fillstyle != 'none' else False
        self._marker_function()
```

By updating the assignment of the `_filled` attribute, we ensure that when `fillstyle` is set to `'none'`, `_filled` will be set to `False`, which resolves the issue with markers not being hollow when using `ax.scatter()` with a custom `MarkerStyle` and `fillstyle='none`.

This corrected version of the function aligns with the expected behavior described in the failing test case and addresses the GitHub issue where markers were not hollow when using a specific `fillstyle`.
