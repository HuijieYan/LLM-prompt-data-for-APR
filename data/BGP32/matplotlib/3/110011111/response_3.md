To fix the bug in the `_recache` function of the `MarkerStyle` class, we need to address the issue where the `_filled` attribute is always set to `True` regardless of the value of the `fillstyle`. The issue stems from the fact that the `is_filled` method checks the `_filled` attribute, which is not correctly updated based on the `fillstyle` set.

Here is the corrected version of the `_recache` function:

```python
class MarkerStyle():
    def _recache(self):
        if self._marker_function is None:
            return
        self._path = _empty_path
        self._transform = IdentityTransform()
        self._alt_path = None
        self._alt_transform = None
        self._snap_threshold = None
        self._joinstyle = 'round'
        self._capstyle = 'butt'
        self._filled = self._fillstyle != 'none'
        self._marker_function()
```

By updating the `_filled` attribute based on the value of `_fillstyle`, we ensure that the marker is properly filled or hollow based on the specified `fillstyle`. This fix addresses the bug reported by the failing tests and the GitHub issue related to markers not being hollow when the `fillstyle` is set to 'none'.
