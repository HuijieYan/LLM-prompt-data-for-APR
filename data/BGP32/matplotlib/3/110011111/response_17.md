To fix the bug in the `_recache` function, we need to update the `_filled` variable based on the provided `fillstyle`. If the `fillstyle` is set to `'none'`, then the marker should not be filled, hence `_filled` should be set to `False`. 

Below is the corrected version of the `_recache` function:

```python
class MarkerStyle():
    def _recache(self):
        if self._marker_function is None:
            return
        self._path = _empty_path
        self._transform = IdentityTransform()
        self._alt_path = None
        self._alt_transform = None
        self._snap_threshold = None
        self._joinstyle = 'round'
        self._capstyle = 'butt'
        self._filled = self._fillstyle != 'none'
        self._marker_function()
```

By updating the `_filled` variable based on the `fillstyle` condition, the corrected function will now correctly handle the scenario when `fillstyle` is set to `'none'`, making the marker hollow as intended.

This fix ensures that when the `fillstyle` is set to `'none'`, the marker will be hollow, resolving the issue reported on GitHub regarding markers not being hollow when using `ax.scatter()` and setting `MarkerStyle()`'s `fillstyle` to `'none' as expected.
