## Analysis
- The buggy function `_recache` is part of the `MarkerStyle` class.
- The failing test is checking the `is_filled()` method of `MarkerStyle` after setting the `fillstyle` to `'none'`.
- The failing test indicates that the `MarkerStyle` is still considered filled when it should not be.
- The `_recache` function initializes some properties of `MarkerStyle` but does not handle the `fillstyle` properly, leading to the issue.
- The expected behavior is for a marker with `fillstyle='none'` to be considered unfilled.
- The failing test provides an assert statement that deduces that the marker is still treated as filled.

## Bug Explanation
- The `_recache` function sets `_filled = True` unconditionally, irrespective of the `fillstyle` being set to `'none'`. This is incorrect behavior.
- When the `fillstyle` is explicitly set to `'none'`, the `MarkerStyle` should be considered unfilled.

## Fix Strategy
- Modify the `_recache` function to update the `_filled` property based on the `fillstyle`.
- If `fillstyle` is `'none'`, set `_filled` to `False`, indicating the marker should not be filled.

## Bug-fixed version
```python
class MarkerStyle():
    def _recache(self):
        if self._marker_function is None:
            return
        self._path = _empty_path
        self._transform = IdentityTransform()
        self._alt_path = None
        self._alt_transform = None
        self._snap_threshold = None
        self._joinstyle = 'round'
        self._capstyle = 'butt'
        self._filled = self._fillstyle != 'none'
        self._marker_function()
```

By updating the `_filled` property based on the `fillstyle` value, the bug is fixed. Now, when `fillstyle` is set to `'none'`, the marker will be considered unfilled as expected.
