To fix the bug in the `_recache` function of the `MarkerStyle` class, we need to adjust the setting of the `_filled` attribute based on the `fillstyle`. The `fillstyle` of `'none'` should result in `_filled` being set to `False` to represent a hollow marker.

Here is the corrected version of the `_recache` function:

```python
class MarkerStyle():
    
    def _recache(self):
        if self._marker_function is None:
            return
        self._path = _empty_path
        self._transform = IdentityTransform()
        self._alt_path = None
        self._alt_transform = None
        self._snap_threshold = None
        self._joinstyle = 'round'
        self._capstyle = 'butt'
        self._filled = self._fillstyle != 'none'
        self._marker_function()
```

By adjusting the `_filled` attribute to be `False` when `fillstyle` is set to `'none'`, the corrected function will ensure that the marker is hollow when the `fillstyle` is specified as such. This modification resolves the issue described in the GitHub report and aligns the behavior with the expected outcome when setting `fillstyle='none'`.

This corrected version should now pass the failing test cases and satisfy the expected input/output values, successfully addressing the problem reported in the GitHub issue.
