To fix the bug in the `_recache` function, we need to update the value of the `_filled` attribute based on the `fillstyle` parameter passed to the `MarkerStyle` class. The current implementation always sets `_filled` to `True`, which is incorrect when `fillstyle` is set to `'none'`.

Here is the corrected version of the `_recache` function:

```python
class MarkerStyle:

    def _recache(self):
        if self._marker_function is None:
            return
        self._path = _empty_path
        self._transform = IdentityTransform()
        self._alt_path = None
        self._alt_transform = None
        self._snap_threshold = None
        self._joinstyle = 'round'
        self._capstyle = 'butt'

        if self._fillstyle == 'none':
            self._filled = False
        else:
            self._filled = True

        self._marker_function()
```

By adding the condition to check if `self._fillstyle` is `'none'`, we update the value of `_filled` accordingly. This change will ensure that the `MarkerStyle` class behaves correctly when `fillstyle` is set to `'none'`.

Make sure this corrected version resolves the failing test as described in the expected values and types of variables section above. This fix addresses the issue reported on GitHub where markers were not hollow when using `ax.scatter()` and setting the `fillstyle` to `'none'.
