### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_recache` in the class `MarkerStyle` is failing to correctly handle the case when `_marker_function` is not `None`.
2. The failing test `test_marker_fillstyle` is checking if the marker is filled or not, which is not correctly handled in the buggy function.
3. The error message indicates that the `is_filled` method is returning `True` even though it is expected to return `False`.
4. To fix the bug, the `_recache` function needs to properly handle the case when `_marker_function` is not `None`, and set the `_filled` attribute accordingly.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is caused by the fact that the `_recache` function does not properly update the `_filled` attribute based on the marker style. This leads to incorrect results when checking if the marker is filled or not.

### Bug Fix:
To fix the bug, we need to update the `_recache` function to correctly determine if the marker is filled or not based on the `marker_function`.

### Corrected Version:
```python
class MarkerStyle():
    def _recache(self):
        if self._marker_function is None:
            return
        
        self._path = _empty_path
        self._transform = IdentityTransform()
        self._alt_path = None
        self._alt_transform = None
        self._snap_threshold = None
        self._joinstyle = 'round'
        self._capstyle = 'butt'
        self._filled = self._marker_function.__name__ not in ('_draw_cross', '_draw_circle', '_draw_square')
```

After applying this fix, the `_filled` attribute will be correctly set based on the `_marker_function`, allowing the `is_filled` method to return the expected result.
