## Analysis
1. The buggy function `_recache` in the `MarkerStyle` class is supposed to reinitialize certain attributes when called. However, there seems to be an issue with the way the `_marker_function` is being used.
2. The failing test `test_marker_fillstyle` tries to check if the `is_filled` method returns `False` after setting `fillstyle='none'`, but it fails due to the bug in the `_recache` function.
3. The error message indicates that the `is_filled` method is returning `True` instead of `False`, which is causing the assertion error.
4. To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the `_marker_function` is properly set to update the fillstyle attribute based on the new settings provided during the creation of `MarkerStyle`.
5. A corrected version of the `_recache` function is provided below:

## Corrected Version
```python
class MarkerStyle():

    def _recache(self):
        if self._marker_function is None:
            return
        self._path = _empty_path
        self._transform = IdentityTransform()
        self._alt_path = None
        self._alt_transform = None
        self._snap_threshold = None
        self._joinstyle = 'round'
        self._capstyle = 'butt'
        self._filled = self.get_fillstyle() != 'none'  # Check fillstyle setting
        self._marker_function()
        
    def get_fillstyle(self):
        return self.fillstyle
    
    def is_filled(self):
        return self._filled
```

By updating the `_recache` function to correctly determine the `filled` attribute based on the fillstyle setting, the corrected version should now pass the failing test and address the issue reported on GitHub.
