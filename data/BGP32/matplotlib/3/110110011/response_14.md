### Analysis:
- The buggy function `_recache` in the `MarkerStyle` class initializes certain attributes but also calls `self._marker_function()` which might be unnecessary.
- The failing test `test_marker_fillstyle` is trying to check if the marker is filled or not, but due to the incorrect implementation in the `_recache` function, it fails.
- The error message shows that the test fails because it expects the marker to not be filled, but the implementation does not handle this correctly.
- The GitHub issue indicates that setting `fillstyle='none'` does not result in hollow markers as expected by the user.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is caused because the `MarkerStyle` class is not correctly handling the `is_filled()` method when the `fillstyle` is set to `'none'`. The `_recache` function does not handle this case, resulting in the marker being filled when it should not be.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to make sure that when `fillstyle='none'` is set, the marker is hollow. This can be achieved by modifying the logic in the `_recache` function to properly handle the `fillstyle` parameter.

### Corrected Version:
```python
class MarkerStyle():
    def __init__(self, marker='o', fillstyle='full'):
        self._marker_function = None
        self.marker = marker
        if fillstyle == 'none':
            self._filled = False
        else:
            self._filled = True
        self._recache()

    def is_filled(self):
        return self._filled

    def get_fillstyle(self):
        return 'full' if self._filled else 'none'

    def _recache(self):
        if self._marker_function is None:
            return
        self._path = _empty_path
        self._transform = IdentityTransform()
        self._alt_path = None
        self._alt_transform = None
        self._snap_threshold = None
        self._joinstyle = 'round'
        self._capstyle = 'butt'
        if self._filled:
            self._filled = True
            self._marker_function()
        else:
            self._filled = False
```

By modifying the `_recache` function to correctly handle the `fillstyle` parameter and update the `_filled` attribute accordingly, the corrected version of the `MarkerStyle` class should now correctly represent whether the marker is filled or not based on the `fillstyle` parameter. This fix should make the failing test pass and resolve the issue reported on GitHub.
