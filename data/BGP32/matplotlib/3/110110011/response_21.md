### Analysis:
1. The `MarkerStyle` class in the `markers.py` file contains the `_recache` method which is intended to recache marker properties. In the failing test, the `is_filled()` method is called to check if the marker is filled or not. The failing test tries to create a `MarkerStyle` with `fillstyle='none'`, but the `is_filled()` method does not correctly handle this case.
2. The bug occurs when the `is_filled()` method does not properly determine the fill status based on the `fillstyle` parameter.
3. The bug is causing the test to fail with an assertion error because the `is_filled()` method does not recognize the `fillstyle='none'` case correctly. This leads to unexpected behavior of marker filling.
4. To fix the bug, we need to update the `is_filled()` method to correctly handle the `fillstyle='none'` case.
5. Let's provide a corrected version of the `MarkerStyle` class with the fixed `is_filled()` method:

### Corrected Version:
```python
class MarkerStyle():
    def _recache(self):
        if self._marker_function is None:
            return
        self._path = _empty_path
        self._transform = IdentityTransform()
        self._alt_path = None
        self._alt_transform = None
        self._snap_threshold = None
        self._joinstyle = 'round'
        self._capstyle = 'butt'
        self._filled = True
        self._marker_function()
    
    def is_filled(self):
        if self.get_fillstyle() == 'none':
            return False
        return self._filled
```

By updating the `is_filled()` method to check for `'none'` in `get_fillstyle()`, we ensure that the correct fill status is returned. This correction should make the failing test pass and resolve the issue reported on GitHub related to marker filling style.
