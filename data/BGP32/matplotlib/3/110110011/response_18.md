### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_recache()` within the `MarkerStyle` class is not properly initializing the `_filled` attribute, causing issues with the `is_filled()` method.
2. The failing test `test_marker_fillstyle()` checks the `is_filled()` method but encounters an assertion error due to the incorrect initialization of `_filled`.
3. The error message indicates that the `MarkerStyle` object is considered filled when it should not be, leading to a failed assertion in the test.
4. To fix the bug, we need to correctly handle the `_filled` attribute based on the `fillstyle` parameter provided during the creation of a `MarkerStyle` object.

### Proposed Fix:
```python
class MarkerStyle():

    def _recache(self):
        if self._marker_function is None:
            return
        self._path = _empty_path
        self._transform = IdentityTransform()
        self._alt_path = None
        self._alt_transform = None
        self._snap_threshold = None
        self._joinstyle = 'round'
        self._capstyle = 'butt'
        
        # Check if fillstyle is set to 'none' to determine if the marker should be filled or not
        if self.get_fillstyle() == 'none':
            self._filled = False
        else:
            self._filled = True
        
        self._marker_function()
```

By updating the `_recache()` function to correctly set the `_filled` attribute based on the `fillstyle`, we ensure that the `is_filled()` method behaves as expected. This fix addresses the buggy behavior reported in the GitHub issue and should make the failing test `test_marker_fillstyle()` pass successfully.
