## Analysis:
1. **Buggy function:** The `_recache` function in the `MarkerStyle` class is responsible for resetting various attributes of the MarkerStyle instance to default values and then calling the `_marker_function`.
2. **Relationship with the test code:** The failing test `test_marker_fillstyle` creates a `MarkerStyle` instance with `fillstyle='none'` and tries to assert that the marker is not filled.
3. **Error message:** The error message indicates that the `is_filled` method is returning `True` which is not expected.
4. **GitHub issue:** The GitHub issue also describes a similar scenario where setting `fillstyle='none'` does not result in hollow markers as expected.

## Error Location:
The bug is likely in the `is_filled` method within the `MarkerStyle` class. If this method is returning `True` when `fillstyle` is set to `'none'`, it indicates that the method is not properly handling the `fillstyle`.

## Cause of the Bug:
The cause of the bug is that the `is_filled` method is not correctly evaluating the `fillstyle` parameter. This leads to the method returning `True` instead of `False` when `fillstyle` is set to `'none'`.

## Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to update the `is_filled` method in the `MarkerStyle` class to properly handle the `fillstyle='none'` case. We should update the logic in this method to return `False` when `fillstyle` is set to `'none'`.

## Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
class MarkerStyle():
    
    def _recache(self):
        if self._marker_function is None:
            return
        self._path = _empty_path
        self._transform = IdentityTransform()
        self._alt_path = None
        self._alt_transform = None
        self._snap_threshold = None
        self._joinstyle = 'round'
        self._capstyle = 'butt'
        self._filled = True
        self._marker_function()
    
    def is_filled(self):
        if self.get_fillstyle() == 'full':
            return True
        else:
            return False
    
    def get_fillstyle(self):
        return self.get_fill()[0]
```

With this correction, the `is_filled` method now correctly checks if the `fillstyle` is set to `'full'` to determine if the marker is filled. It will return `False` if the `fillstyle` is set to `'none'`, which aligns with the expected behavior described in the failing test and GitHub issue.
