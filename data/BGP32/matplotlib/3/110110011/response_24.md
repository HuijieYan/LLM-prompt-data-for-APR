### Analyzing the buggy function and related information:

1. **Buggy Function**: The `_recache` function is a method of the `MarkerStyle` class which is intended to update certain attributes of the class instance. It seems to reset some attributes and then attempts to call `_marker_function` which might update the marker style.

2. **Failing Test**: The failing test is checking if the fill style of a marker is set to 'none' and verifies that it is not filled. This test fails due to the incorrect behavior of the `is_filled` method in `MarkerStyle`.

3. **Error Message**: The error message indicates that the `assert not marker_style.is_filled()` assertion fails, suggesting that the `is_filled` method returns `True`.

4. **GitHub Issue**: The GitHub issue mentions that setting `fillstyle='none'` is not resulting in hollow markers as expected when using `ax.scatter()`. This aligns with the failing test scenario.

### Cause of the Bug:
The bug seems to be related to the `is_filled` method in the `MarkerStyle` class. The `_recache` method resets the state of the `MarkerStyle` instance but does not handle the `filled` attribute correctly.

The failing test checks for the negation of `marker_style.is_filled()` which is expected to return `False` when `fillstyle='none'`, but the current implementation is not handling this scenario properly.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the `is_filled` method returns the correct value based on the `fillstyle` set in the `MarkerStyle` instance. Since the failing test expects `False` when `fillstyle='none'`, we should update the `is_filled` method to reflect this logic correctly.

### Corrected Version of the `_recache` function:
```python
class MarkerStyle():
    def _recache(self):
        if self._marker_function is None:
            return
        self._path = _empty_path
        self._transform = IdentityTransform()
        self._alt_path = None
        self._alt_transform = None
        self._snap_threshold = None
        self._joinstyle = 'round'
        self._capstyle = 'butt'
        self._filled = True  # Default to filled, should be updated based on fillstyle
        if self.get_fillstyle() == 'none':
            self._filled = False
        self._marker_function()

    def is_filled(self):
        return self._filled

    def get_fillstyle(self):
        return self._fillstyle
```

With this correction, the `is_filled` method now correctly reflects the filled status based on the `fillstyle` attribute, ensuring that the failing test passes and conforms to the expected behavior.
