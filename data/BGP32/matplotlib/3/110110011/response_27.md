## Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_recache` is a method inside the `MarkerStyle` class in the `markers.py` file of the `matplotlib` library.
2. The failing test `test_marker_fillstyle` is in the `test_marker.py` file where it tests the `MarkerStyle` class with a specific `fillstyle`.
3. The error occurs when calling the `is_filled()` method on the `MarkerStyle` object, leading to an assertion error.
4. The GitHub issue highlights a user's confusion about the `fillstyle='none'` parameter not resulting in hollow markers as expected when used with `ax.scatter()`.

## Bug Cause:
The bug is caused by not implementing the `is_filled()` method correctly in the `MarkerStyle` class. The method should return `True` if the marker is filled and `False` otherwise. Currently, it is not implemented, which leads to unexpected behavior in the test case.

## Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to properly implement the `is_filled()` method within the `MarkerStyle` class. We should check the `fillstyle` parameter and determine if the marker is filled based on that information.

## Corrected Version:
```python
# The corrected version of the buggy function with added is_filled method

class MarkerStyle:

    def _recache(self):
        if self._marker_function is None:
            return
        self._path = _empty_path
        self._transform = IdentityTransform()
        self._alt_path = None
        self._alt_transform = None
        self._snap_threshold = None
        self._joinstyle = 'round'
        self._capstyle = 'butt'
        self._filled = True
        self._marker_function()

    def is_filled(self):
        if self.get_fillstyle() == 'none':
            return False
        return True
```

In this corrected version, we have added the `is_filled` method that checks the `fillstyle` parameter and returns `False` if it's set to `'none'`, indicating the marker is not filled. This change should make the failing test case `test_marker_fillstyle` pass successfully.
