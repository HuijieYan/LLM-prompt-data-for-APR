### Analyzing the buggy function:
1. The buggy function `_recache` in the `MarkerStyle` class initializes certain attributes when called.
2. The function checks if `_marker_function` is `None`, and if not, it tries to call it.
3. There is an issue with the usage of `_marker_function` in the buggy function `_recache`.
4. The failing test `test_marker_fillstyle()` tries to check if the marker style is not filled after setting `fillstyle='none'`, but it fails due to the bug.
5. The error message shows that the `is_filled()` method is returning `True` instead of the expected `False`.

### Understanding the bug:
1. The bug lies in the fact that the `_marker_function()` call is made without checking if `_marker_function` is defined, leading to unexpected behavior.
2. Due to this, the marker is always being filled, even when `fillstyle='none'` is set.

### Fixing the bug:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the `_marker_function` is properly defined before attempting to call it.

### Corrected version of the function:
```python
class MarkerStyle():
    def _recache(self):
        if self._marker_function is None:
            return
        self._path = _empty_path
        self._transform = IdentityTransform()
        self._alt_path = None
        self._alt_transform = None
        self._snap_threshold = None
        self._joinstyle = 'round'
        self._capstyle = 'butt'
        self._filled = True
        self._marker_function()
```

After making this correction, the MarkerStyle class should now behave correctly when setting `fillstyle='none'`, resolving the issue and passing the failing test.
