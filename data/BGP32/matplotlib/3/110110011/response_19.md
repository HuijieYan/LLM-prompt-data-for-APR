### Analysis
The buggy function `_recache` in the `MarkerStyle` class is not correctly setting the `_filled` attribute when the `marker_function` is called. This leads to incorrect behavior when trying to check if the marker is filled or not. The failing test is trying to verify that the marker is not filled when the `fillstyle` is set to `'none'`, but it fails due to the incorrect behavior.

### Potential Error Location
The issue lies in the `_recache` function where the `_filled` attribute is set to `True` unconditionally.

### Cause of the Bug
The bug occurs because the `_recache` function does not correctly update the `_filled` attribute based on the `fillstyle` parameter. As a result, even if `fillstyle` is set to `'none'`, the marker is still considered filled, leading to the failing test.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the `_filled` attribute is set based on the value of the `fillstyle` parameter. If the `fillstyle` is `'none'`, then the marker should be considered not filled.

### Corrected Version of the Buggy Function
Here is the corrected version of the `_recache` function in the `MarkerStyle` class:

```python
class MarkerStyle():
    def _recache(self):
        if self._marker_function is None:
            return
        
        self._path = _empty_path
        self._transform = IdentityTransform()
        self._alt_path = None
        self._alt_transform = None
        self._snap_threshold = None
        self._joinstyle = 'round'
        self._capstyle = 'butt'
        
        # Check if fillstyle is set to 'none' and update _filled accordingly
        if self.get_fillstyle() == 'none':
            self._filled = False
        else:
            self._filled = True
        
        self._marker_function()
```

### Updated Test Function
After applying the fix, the failing test should now pass:

```python
def test_marker_fillstyle():
    marker_style = markers.MarkerStyle(marker='o', fillstyle='none')
    assert marker_style.get_fillstyle() == 'none'
    assert not marker_style.is_filled()
```

By updating the `_recache` function to correctly set the `_filled` attribute based on the `fillstyle` parameter, the issue reported on GitHub should be resolved, and the failing test will pass as expected.
