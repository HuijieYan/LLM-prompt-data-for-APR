### Analysis:
1. **Buggy Function and Class Relationship**:
   - The `_recache` function is a method of the `MarkerStyle` class.
   - The purpose of this method is to update the internal attributes of the `MarkerStyle` class based on some conditions.

2. **Identified Error Locations**:
   - The error seems to be related to the `is_filled` method, which is not properly defined in the provided code snippet.

3. **Cause of the Bug**:
   - The failing test is trying to verify that the `is_filled` method of the `MarkerStyle` class returns `False` when the `fillstyle` is set to `'none'`.
   - The error message indicates that the `is_filled` method is not behaving as expected, leading to an assertion error.

4. **Bug Fix Strategy**:
   - To fix the bug, we need to define the `is_filled` method in the `MarkerStyle` class so that it correctly reflects the `fillstyle` attribute.
   - The `is_filled` method should return `True` if the `fillstyle` is not `'none'`, and `False` if the `fillstyle` is set to `'none'`.

### Updated Corrected Version:
```python
class MarkerStyle:
    def _recache(self):
        if self._marker_function is None:
            return
        self._path = _empty_path
        self._transform = IdentityTransform()
        self._alt_path = None
        self._alt_transform = None
        self._snap_threshold = None
        self._joinstyle = 'round'
        self._capstyle = 'butt'
        self._filled = True
        self._marker_function()
    
    def is_filled(self):
        return self.get_fillstyle() != 'none'
```

By adding the `is_filled` method to the `MarkerStyle` class, we ensure that the `MarkerStyle` object correctly determines if it is filled or not based on the `fillstyle` attribute. This fix will address the failing test and resolve the issue reported on GitHub.
