### 1. Analyze the buggy function and its relationship with corresponding error message.
The `_recache` function is responsible for resetting several attributes of a `MarkerStyle` object. The error message is triggered when calling the `is_filled` method of the `MarkerStyle` object after setting the `filled` attribute to `True` in the `_recache` function.

### 2. Identify potential error locations within the buggy function.
The bug could potentially lie in the `_recache` function where `self._filled` is set to `True`, causing the `is_filled` method to return `True` unexpectedly.

### 3. Explain the cause of the bug using the buggy function, the corresponding error message.
The bug occurs because the `_filled` attribute is mistakenly set to `True` in the `_recache` function, leading to the `is_filled` method always returning `True`, which is not the expected behavior based on the test.

### 4. Suggest a strategy for fixing the bug.
To fix the bug, we should ensure that the `_filled` attribute is set based on the actual fillstyle attribute in the `MarkerStyle` object rather than hardcoded to `True` in the `_recache` method.

### 5. Given the buggy function below, provide a corrected version.

```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    
    # Correct the setting of _filled based on fillstyle
    if self._fillstyle in ['full', 'left', 'right']:
        self._filled = True
    else:
        self._filled = False
    
    self._marker_function()
```

In the corrected version, the `_filled` attribute is set based on the `fillstyle` attribute of the `MarkerStyle` object, ensuring that the `is_filled` method behaves correctly according to the specified `fillstyle`.
