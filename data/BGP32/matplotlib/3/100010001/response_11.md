### Analysis:
The error message indicates that the `is_filled` method is returning `True` when it should return `False`. This means that the `_filled` attribute is not being set correctly in the `_recache` method, causing the marker to be considered filled when it shouldn't be.

### Bug location:
The bug is most likely in the `_recache` method where the `_filled` attribute is set to `True` by default. This leads to markers being considered filled without explicitly setting the `fillstyle` attribute.

### Cause of the bug:
The `_filled` attribute is set to `True` by default in the `_recache` method, which causes markers to be considered filled without taking into account the `fillstyle` attribute set by the user.

### Strategy for fixing the bug:
To fix this bug, we need to modify the `_recache` method to consider the `fillstyle` attribute when setting the `_filled` attribute. If the `fillstyle` is set to `'none'`, then `_filled` should be set to `False`, otherwise it should default to `True`.

### Corrected version of the function:
```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    
    if self.get_fillstyle() == 'none':
        self._filled = False
    else:
        self._filled = True

    self._marker_function()
```

This corrected version of the `_recache` method will properly set the `_filled` attribute based on the `fillstyle` attribute, ensuring that markers are filled or not filled as specified by the user.
