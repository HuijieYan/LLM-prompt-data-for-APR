### Analysis:
The error message indicates that there is an issue with the `is_filled()` method of the `MarkerStyle` class. The test is expecting the marker to not be filled (`fillstyle='none'`), but the `is_filled()` method is returning `True`.

### Bug Location:
The bug likely lies in the implementation of the `is_filled()` method within the `MarkerStyle` class.

### Bug Cause:
Looking at the `is_filled()` method, it seems that the logic is incorrect as it is always returning `True`, which is causing the test to fail.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to correctly implement the `is_filled()` method so that it returns `True` only when the marker is filled and `False` when it is not filled.

### Corrected Version:
```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: lib/matplotlib/markers.py

def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    self._filled = True
    self._marker_function()
    
class MarkerStyle:
    def __init__(self, marker=None, fillstyle=None):
        self.marker = marker
        self.fillstyle = fillstyle

    def is_filled(self):
        return self.fillstyle != 'none'

    def get_fillstyle(self):
        return self.fillstyle
```

This corrected version includes a corrected implementation of the `is_filled()` method within the `MarkerStyle` class, which now correctly returns `True` if the marker is filled and `False` if it is not filled.
