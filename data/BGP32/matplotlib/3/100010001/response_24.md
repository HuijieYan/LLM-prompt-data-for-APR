### Analysis:
The error message indicates that the `is_filled` method is not behaving as expected when called on the `MarkerStyle` object. The failing test is asserting that `marker_style.is_filled()` should return `False`, but it is returning `True`. This suggests that there is a bug in the implementation of the `is_filled` method in the `MarkerStyle` class.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is caused by the fact that the `_filled` attribute in the `MarkerStyle` class is always initialized to `True` in the `_recache` function, regardless of the `fillstyle` parameter passed during the construction of the `MarkerStyle` instance. This initialization is done before calling the `_marker_function`. As a result, the `is_filled` method always returns `True` because of the `_filled` attribute being set to `True`.

### Fix Strategy:
To fix this bug, we need to update the `MarkerStyle` class to correctly set the `_filled` attribute based on the `fillstyle` parameter passed during the construction of the `MarkerStyle` instance.

### Corrected Version:
```python
from .transforms import IdentityTransform

# Corrected version of the buggy function
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    
    if self._fillstyle and self._fillstyle != 'full':
        self._filled = False
    else:
        self._filled = True
        
    self._marker_function()
```

By incorporating the condition to set `_filled` based on the `fillstyle` parameter, the corrected version of the `_recache` function now properly handles the filling status of the `MarkerStyle` instance. This fix ensures that the `is_filled` method behaves as expected based on the `fillstyle` parameter that was passed.
