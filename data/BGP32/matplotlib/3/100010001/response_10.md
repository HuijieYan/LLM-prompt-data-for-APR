### Analysis:
The error message indicates that the `is_filled` method is returning `True` when it should actually return `False`. This suggests that the `_filled` attribute in the `_recache` function is not being set correctly, causing `is_filled` to return the wrong value.

### Identify potential error locations:
- The `_filled` attribute is set to `True` in the `_recache` function, but the test expects it to be `False`.

### Cause of the bug:
The bug is caused by setting the `_filled` attribute to `True` unconditionally in the `_recache` function, which conflicts with the behavior expected by the `is_filled` method.

### Strategy for fixing the bug:
To fix the bug, we need to modify the `_recache` function to properly set the `_filled` attribute based on the fill style provided.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    
    if self._fillstyle == 'full':
        self._filled = True
    else:
        self._filled = False
    
    self._marker_function()
```

By adding a conditional check to set the `_filled` attribute based on the fill style, we ensure that the `is_filled` method will return the correct value. This correction should resolve the error message and allow the test to pass successfully.
