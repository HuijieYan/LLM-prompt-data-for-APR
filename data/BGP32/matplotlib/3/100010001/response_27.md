### Analysis:
The error message indicates that the `MarkerStyle` object does not have the correct behavior when checking if it is filled. This behavior is determined by the `is_filled()` method which seems to be causing the issue.

### Potential Error Location:
The function `_recache` sets the `_filled` attribute to `True`, but the logic for determining if the marker is filled or not is not present in the provided code snippet. This could potentially lead to the error.

### Bug Cause:
The `is_filled()` method is being called on the `MarkerStyle` object, but the logic to check whether `_filled` attribute is `True` or `False` is missing in the original `_recache` function.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
We need to implement the logic for the `is_filled()` method within the `MarkerStyle` class, so it correctly reflects the value of the `_filled` attribute.

### Corrected Version:
```python
# The corrected version of the function

# Import required modules if needed
# from .transforms import IdentityTransform, Affine2D

class MarkerStyle:
    def __init__(self, marker='o', fillstyle='full'):
        self._filled = fillstyle != 'none'

    def is_filled(self):
        return self._filled

    def get_fillstyle(self):
        return 'none' if not self._filled else 'full'

def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    self._filled = True
    self._marker_function()
```

By introducing the `MarkerStyle` class with the `is_filled()` method and `_filled` attribute, we can properly handle whether a marker is filled or not. This should resolve the issue and allow the test to pass successfully.
