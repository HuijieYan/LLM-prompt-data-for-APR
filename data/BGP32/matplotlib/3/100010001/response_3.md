### Analysis:
The error message indicates that the `is_filled` method is returning `True` when it should have returned `False`. This behavior is unexpected based on the test case, which sets the `fillstyle` to `'none'`. 

### Error Location:
The bug is likely in the implementation of the `MarkerStyle` class, specifically in the `is_filled` method.

### Cause of the Bug:
The `_recache` function sets the `_filled` attribute to `True` regardless of the `fillstyle` specified in the `MarkerStyle` object. This inconsistency leads to the incorrect behavior observed in the failing test.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the `_filled` attribute reflects the `fillstyle` specified in the `MarkerStyle` object. This can be achieved by updating the `_recache` function to set the `_filled` attribute based on the `fillstyle`.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    self._filled = self.fillstyle != 'none'  # Update _filled based on fillstyle
    self._marker_function()
```

By updating the assignment of `_filled` based on the `fillstyle`, we ensure that the `is_filled` method correctly reflects the `fillstyle` specified for the `MarkerStyle` object.
