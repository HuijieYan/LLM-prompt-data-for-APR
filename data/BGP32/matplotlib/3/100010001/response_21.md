### Analysis:
The `_recache` function is responsible for resetting the marker properties to default values. The issue in the buggy function is that it is trying to call `self._marker_function()` without validating if it exists or not. This leads to an AttributeError when trying to call the non-existent `_marker_function`.

### Error:
The error arises from the fact that `_marker_function` is not defined, but the function is trying to call it unconditionally. This causes an AttributeError and results in failing tests related to the marker filling style.

### Fix Strategy:
1. Check if `_marker_function` exists before calling it to prevent the AttributeError.
2. If `_marker_function` is not defined, don't call it and continue with setting the default marker properties.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    self._filled = True
    if hasattr(self, '_marker_function'):
        self._marker_function()
```

By adding the `if hasattr(self, '_marker_function')` check, we ensure that `_marker_function` is only called if it exists, preventing the AttributeError.
