### Analysis:
The error message indicates that the `is_filled` method is not returning the expected value. This method is called within the `test_marker_fillstyle` test and is failing because it is returning `True` when it should be returning `False`.

### Potential Error Locations:
The issue is likely within the `is_filled` method of the `MarkerStyle` class, which is not provided here but is called within the buggy `_recache` function.

### Cause of the Bug:
The bug is caused by the `_recache` function not correctly setting the `_filled` attribute of the `MarkerStyle` class. Since the `_filled` attribute is set to `True` by default, the `is_filled` method always returns `True` instead of checking the actual fill status specified by the `fillstyle` attribute.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the `_filled` attribute is set correctly based on the `fillstyle` specified in the `MarkerStyle` class.

### Corrected Version:
```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: lib/matplotlib/markers.py

def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    self._filled = self._fillstyle != 'none'  # Fix: Set _filled based on fillstyle
    self._marker_function()
```

In the corrected version, I've included a line to properly set the `_filled` attribute based on the `fillstyle`. This change ensures that the `is_filled` method returns the correct value according to the actual fill status specified.
