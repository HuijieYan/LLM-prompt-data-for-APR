### Analysis:
1. The error message indicates that the `MarkerStyle.is_filled` method is not returning the correct value.
2. The buggy `_recache` function initializes `self._filled` to `True`.
3. The failing test checks if the marker style is not filled, which means `is_filled` method should return `False`.
4. The bug seems to be in the implementation of the `is_filled` method.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is caused by the `self._filled` attribute being set to `True` by default in the `_recache` function. This causes the `is_filled` method to always return `True`, regardless of the fillstyle specified.

### Bug Fix:
To fix the bug, we need to update the `is_filled` method to correctly return whether the marker is filled based on the fillstyle specified during the initialization.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def is_filled(self) -> bool:
    return self._filled

def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    self._filled = self._fillstyle != 'none'  # Update filled based on fillstyle
    self._marker_function()
``` 

By updating the `_recache` function to correctly set the `self._filled` attribute based on the fillstyle, the `is_filled` method should return the correct value, and the failing test should pass.
