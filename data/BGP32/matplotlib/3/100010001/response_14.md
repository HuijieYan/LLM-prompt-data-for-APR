1. **Analysis:**
The error message is indicating that the assertion `assert not True` failed. This assertion is related to the `is_filled()` method in the `MarkerStyle` class. The error message includes the traceback showing the state of the system when the assertion failed.

2. **Potential Error Location:**
The error seems to be related to the `is_filled()` method in the `MarkerStyle` class, which is likely calling the `_recache()` function. There might be an issue with how `_recache()` initializes the `_filled` attribute.

3. **Cause of the Bug:**
The `_recache()` function in the `MarkerStyle` class initializes the `_filled` attribute to `True`, which is opposite to what the test is expecting. This mismatch in initialization causes the `is_filled()` method to return `True` instead of `False`, leading to the failed assertion.

4. **Strategy for Fixing the Bug:**
To resolve the bug, we need to ensure that when the `MarkerStyle` instance is created with `fillstyle='none'`, the `_filled` attribute is set accordingly. This can be achieved by modifying the `_recache()` function to correctly initialize the `_filled` attribute based on the `fillstyle`.

5. **Corrected Version:**
```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: lib/matplotlib/markers.py

class MarkerStyle:
    def _recache(self):
        if self._marker_function is None:
            return
        self._path = _empty_path
        self._transform = IdentityTransform()
        self._alt_path = None
        self._alt_transform = None
        self._snap_threshold = None
        self._joinstyle = 'round'
        self._capstyle = 'butt
        
        # Adjust _filled attribute based on fillstyle
        if self._fillstyle == 'none':
            self._filled = False
        else:
            self._filled = True

        self._marker_function()
```

In the corrected version, the `_recache()` method now checks the `fillstyle` attribute and sets the `_filled` attribute accordingly. This change ensures that the `is_filled()` method will return the correct value based on the `fillstyle` specified during the creation of the `MarkerStyle` instance.
