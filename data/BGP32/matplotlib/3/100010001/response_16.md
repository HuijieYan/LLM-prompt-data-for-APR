### Analysis:
- The error message indicates that the method `is_filled()` is being called on the `marker_style` object, but it is returning `True` instead of the expected `False`.
- The `is_filled()` method checks the value of the `_filled` attribute to determine if the marker is filled or not.
- The `_recache()` function initializes the `_filled` attribute to `True`, which is causing the issue.

### Bug Cause:
- The bug is caused by the `_filled` attribute being set to `True` in the `_recache()` function, which is the default behavior. This causes the markers to be filled by default.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
- To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the `_filled` attribute is set correctly based on the `fillstyle` parameter provided when creating the `MarkerStyle` object.
- Update the `_recache()` function to set the `_filled` attribute based on the `fillstyle` parameter to respect the `fillstyle='none'`.

### Corrected Version:
```python
# The corrected version of the _recache function
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    
    # Check if fillstyle is set to None
    if self._fillstyle == 'none':
        self._filled = False
    else:
        self._filled = True
        
    self._marker_function()
```

By updating the `_recache()` function to set the `_filled` attribute based on the `fillstyle` parameter, we can ensure that the markers are filled or not filled as expected. This fix should resolve the issue and make the test pass successfully.
