### Analysis:
The error message indicates that the `is_filled` method of the `MarkerStyle` object is not behaving as expected. The failing test is trying to assert that `marker_style.is_filled()` should return `False`, but the actual result is `True`.

### Potential Error Locations:
The buggy function `_recache` sets the `_filled` attribute to `True` unconditionally. This could be causing the unexpected behavior observed in the failing test.

### Cause of the Bug:
The bug is caused by always setting the `_filled` attribute to `True` in the `_recache` function, which prevents the `is_filled` method from returning the correct value based on the `fillstyle`.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
Modify the `_recache` function to take into account the `fillstyle` when determining the `_filled` attribute value. This will ensure that `is_filled` method behaves as expected based on the `fillstyle` specified.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    self._filled = self.get_fillstyle() != 'none'
    self._marker_function()
```

By updating the `_filled` attribute based on the`fillstyle` value, the corrected function will now consider the `fillstyle` setting when determining if the marker is filled or not. This should resolve the issue with the failing test.
