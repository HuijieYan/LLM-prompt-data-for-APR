### Analysis:
The error message indicates that the `is_filled` method of the `MarkerStyle` object is returning `True` when it should actually be returning `False`, causing the test to fail. This suggests that the `_filled` attribute in the `_recache` function of the `MarkerStyle` class is not being set correctly.

### Bug Location:
The `_filled` attribute is being incorrectly set to `True` by default in the `_recache` function. This results in all markers being filled unless explicitly overridden by the `fillstyle`.

### Cause of the Bug:
The bug is caused by setting `_filled` to `True` unconditionally in the `_recache` function, regardless of the `fillstyle` specified by the user. This leads to incorrect behavior when checking if the marker is filled using the `is_filled` method.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to modify the `_recache` function to correctly set the `_filled` attribute based on the `fillstyle`. If the `fillstyle` is set to `'none'`, then `_filled` should be set to `False`.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    
    # Set _filled based on the fillstyle
    if self.get_fillstyle() == 'none':
        self._filled = False
    else:
        self._filled = True
    
    self._marker_function()
```

By updating the `_recache` function to set the `_filled` attribute based on the `fillstyle`, we ensure that the markers will be filled or not filled according to the user's specification. This correction should resolve the bug and make the test pass successfully.
