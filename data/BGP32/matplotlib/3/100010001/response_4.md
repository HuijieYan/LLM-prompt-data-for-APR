1. Analysis:
The failing test is checking the `is_filled` method of the `MarkerStyle` class and expects it to return False for the `fillstyle='none'`. However, the current implementation does not handle the `fillstyle` attribute, and the `is_filled` method does not return the correct result.

2. Potential error locations:
The issue likely lies in the `is_filled` method implementation, as it is not correctly considering the `fillstyle` attribute.

3. Cause of the bug:
The bug is caused by the `is_filled` method not taking into account the `fillstyle` attribute of the marker.

4. Strategy for fixing the bug:
We need to update the `is_filled` method to consider the `fillstyle` attribute set for the marker. If the `fillstyle` is 'none', the method should return False.

5. Corrected version of the function:

```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    self._filled = self.get_fillstyle() != 'none'
    self._marker_function()
```

By updating the `_recache` method to set the `_filled` attribute based on the `fillstyle` value, we ensure that the `is_filled` method of the `MarkerStyle` class returns the correct result when checking for the fill status of the marker. This correction will address the bug and make the failing test pass.
