### Analysis:
1. The `_recache` function is called to reset the properties of the `MarkerStyle` object to default values before computing the marker path.
2. The `_marker_function` method is expected to be defined in the `MarkerStyle` class to recalculate the marker path when called.
3. The failing test indicates that the `is_filled` method is returning `True` when it should return `False` for a marker with `fillstyle='none'`.

### Potential Error:
The bug may lie in the logic of the `is_filled` method or the possible absence of the necessary conditional statement related to the `fillstyle` property.

### Cause of the Bug:
The bug is likely due to the `is_filled` method not accounting for the `fillstyle='none'` condition. As a result, it incorrectly returns `True`, leading to the failing test.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
1. Modify the `is_filled` method to check the `fillstyle` property and return `False` when `fillstyle='none'`.
2. Ensure that the condition for `fillstyle='none'` is properly handled to avoid returning `True` unexpectedly.

### Corrected Version:
```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: lib/matplotlib/markers.py

def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    self._filled = True
    if self._fillstyle == 'none':  # Adjust the filled property based on fill style
        self._filled = False
    self._marker_function()
```

By adding a conditional check for `fillstyle='none'` within the `_recache` function, the `is_filled` method should now return `False` when `fillstyle='none'` is set, resolving the bug and passing the failing test.
