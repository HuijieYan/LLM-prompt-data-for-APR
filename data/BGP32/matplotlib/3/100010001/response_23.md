#### Analysis:
The error message is indicating that the assertion `assert not marker_style.is_filled()` is failing. This implies that the `is_filled()` method is returning `True`, when it should be returning `False`.

#### Potential Error Location:
The issue is likely with the `_recache()` method in the `MarkerStyle` class, specifically with how the `_filled` attribute is being set.

#### Cause of the Bug:
In the buggy `_recache()` method, the `_filled` attribute is always being set to `True`. This causes the `is_filled()` method to always return `True`, even when the fillstyle is set to `'none'`.

#### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to update the `_recache()` method to correctly set the `_filled` attribute based on the fillstyle specified.

#### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    
    if self.get_fillstyle() == 'none':
        self._filled = False
    else:
        self._filled = True
    
    self._marker_function()
``` 

By updating the `_recache()` method to set the `_filled` attribute based on the fillstyle specified, the bug should be resolved. This correction will ensure that the `is_filled()` method returns the correct value based on the fillstyle.
