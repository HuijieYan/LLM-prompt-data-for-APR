### Analysis:
The error message indicates that the `is_filled` method is returning `True` unexpectedly, leading to the failing test. The `is_filled` method seems to be related to the `_filled` attribute of the `MarkerStyle` class, which is set to `True` in the `_recache` method.

### Potential Error Location:
The issue might be with the initialization of the `_filled` attribute in the `_recache` method, where it is always set to `True`.

### Cause of the Bug:
The bug is caused by setting `_filled = True` unconditionally in the `_recache` method. This causes all marker styles to be filled by default, conflicting with the expected behavior for the `fillstyle='none'` case.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
1. Update the `_recache` method to consider the `fillstyle` when setting the `_filled` attribute.
2. If `fillstyle` is `'none'`, set `_filled` to `False`, otherwise keep `_filled` as `True`.
3. This change will align the behavior of the `_filled` attribute with the expected fill style.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    self._filled = self.get_fillstyle() != 'none'  # Update based on fillstyle
    self._marker_function()
```

By updating the `_filled` attribute based on the `fillstyle`, the corrected version of the `_recache` method ensures that markers are filled according to the specified `fillstyle`. This modification should resolve the bug and make the `MarkerStyle` class behave as expected.
