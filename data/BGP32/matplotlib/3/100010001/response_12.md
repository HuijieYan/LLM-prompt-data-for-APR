### Analysis:
- The error message indicates that when calling `is_filled()` method on the `MarkerStyle` object, it returns `True` when it should have returned `False`. This suggests that the `_filled` attribute is not being set correctly in the `_recache` function.

### Error Location:
- The issue seems to be with the setting of the `_filled` attribute in the `_recache` function of the `MarkerStyle` class.

### Cause of the Bug:
- In the buggy function, the `_filled` attribute is being set to `True` unconditionally. This causes all markers to be filled by default, without taking into account the `fillstyle` parameter provided during object creation. 

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
- To fix the bug, we need to set the `_filled` attribute based on the `fillstyle` parameter provided during object creation.
- If the `fillstyle` is `'none'`, then `_filled` should be set to `False` to indicate that the marker should not be filled. Otherwise, `_filled` should be set to `True`.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    self._filled = self._fillstyle != 'none'
    self._marker_function()
```

By updating the assignment of the `_filled` attribute based on the `fillstyle` parameter, we ensure that the correct filling behavior is applied to markers. This fix should address the issue highlighted by the failing test case.
