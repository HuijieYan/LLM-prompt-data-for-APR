#### Analysis:
The error message indicates that the `is_filled()` method is not returning the expected result. This method should determine whether the marker is filled or not. The failing test indicates that the method `is_filled()` is returning `True` when it should not be.

#### Potential Error Locations:
The cause of the bug may lie in the implementation of the `is_filled()` method within the `MarkerStyle` class since it is invoked in the failing test.

#### Cause of the Bug:
The bug is likely caused by the `_filled` attribute not being properly set to reflect the filled status of the marker. In the `_recache()` function provided, the `_filled` attribute is directly set to `True`. This incorrect initialization of the `_filled` attribute leads to the `is_filled()` method returning `True` incorrectly.

#### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To correct the bug, we need to ensure that the `_filled` attribute accurately reflects the filled status of the marker. We can modify the `_recache()` function to set `_filled` based on the `fillstyle` parameter passed during the `MarkerStyle` initialization.

#### Corrected Version:
```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: lib/matplotlib/markers.py

from .transforms import IdentityTransform, Affine2D

class MarkerStyle:
    def __init__(self, marker=None, fillstyle=None):
        self.marker = marker
        self.fillstyle = fillstyle
        self._recache()

    def is_filled(self):
        return self._filled

    def get_fillstyle(self):
        return self.fillstyle

    def _recache(self):
        if self.marker is None:
            return
        self._path = None
        self._transform = IdentityTransform()
        self._alt_path = None
        self._alt_transform = None
        self._snap_threshold = None
        self._joinstyle = 'round'
        self._capstyle = 'butt'

        self._filled = False if self.fillstyle == 'none' else True

        if self.marker is not None:
            # You can set other attributes here as needed
            pass

    def __call__(self):
        pass
```

In this corrected version, the `_filled` attribute is now determined based on the `fillstyle` parameter passed during `MarkerStyle` initialization. If the `fillstyle` is `'none'`, then `_filled` is set to `False`, indicating that the marker is not filled. Otherwise, `_filled` is set to `True`, indicating a filled marker. This correction ensures that the `is_filled()` method will return the correct value based on the `fillstyle`.
