### Analysis:
The error message indicates that the `is_filled` method of the `MarkerStyle` class is returning `True` when it should be returning `False`. This is likely because the `_filled` attribute of the `MarkerStyle` class is set to `True` during the `_recache` method, regardless of the `fillstyle` specified during initialization.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is caused by the `_recache` method always setting the `_filled` attribute to `True` unconditionally, regardless of the `fillstyle` specified. This results in the `is_filled` method always returning `True`, even when the `fillstyle` is set to `'none'`.

### Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to modify the `_recache` method to set the `_filled` attribute based on the `fillstyle` specified during initialization. This will ensure that the `is_filled` method correctly reflects the fill status of the marker style.

### Corrected Version:
```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: lib/matplotlib/markers.py

# Corrected version of the buggy function
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    self._filled = self.get_fillstyle() != 'none'  # Set _filled based on fillstyle
    self._marker_function()
```

In the corrected version, the `_filled` attribute is set based on the `fillstyle` specified during initialization. This change ensures that the `is_filled` method returns the correct fill status of the marker style.
