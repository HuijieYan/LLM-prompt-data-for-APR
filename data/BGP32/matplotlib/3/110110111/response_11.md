In the provided buggy function `_recache`, the issue lies in the assignment of `self._filled = True`, which contradicts the intention of setting the fillstyle to `'none'`. This causes the `is_filled` method to return `True` unexpectedly in the failing test case.

To fix this bug, we need to update the assignment of `self._filled` based on the `self._fillstyle` parameter. If `self._fillstyle` is `'none'`, then `self._filled` should be set to `False`. Otherwise, it should be set to `True`.

Here is the corrected version of the `_recache` function:

```python
# The corrected version of the buggy function
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    self._filled = self._fillstyle != 'none'
    self._marker_function()
```

With this correction, the `is_filled` method will return the expected value based on the `fillstyle` parameter set in the MarkerStyle object, resolving the failing test case mentioned earlier.

This fix addresses the bug reported in the GitHub issue where setting `fillstyle='none'` wasn't resulting in hollow markers as expected.
