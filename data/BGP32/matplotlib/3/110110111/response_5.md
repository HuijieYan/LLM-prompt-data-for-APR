## Analysis
The buggy function `_recache` in the `MarkerStyle` class is setting the `_filled` attribute to `True` unconditionally, which is causing the `is_filled()` method to return `True` even when the `fillstyle` is set to `'none'`. This leads to the failing test where it expects the marker not to be filled.

## Bug Cause
The bug is caused by the `_recache` function unconditionally setting `_filled` to `True`, regardless of the `fillstyle` set in the `MarkerStyle` object.

## Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to update the `_recache` function to consider the `fillstyle` when setting the `_filled` attribute. If the `fillstyle` is `'none'`, `_filled` should be set to `False`.

## The corrected version of the buggy function
```python
class MarkerStyle():
    def _recache(self):
        if self._marker_function is None:
            return
        self._path = _empty_path
        self._transform = IdentityTransform()
        self._alt_path = None
        self._alt_transform = None
        self._snap_threshold = None
        self._joinstyle = 'round'
        self._capstyle = 'butt'
        self._filled = True if self._fillstyle is not 'none' else False
        self._marker_function()
```

By updating the `_filled` attribute based on the `fillstyle`, the corrected version of the `_recache` function ensures that the fill status of the marker aligns with the specified `fillstyle`. This change should resolve the issue and make the `is_filled()` method behave as expected.
