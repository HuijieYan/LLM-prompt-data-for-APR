### Analysis
The buggy function `_recache` is responsible for reinitializing various attributes of the `MarkerStyle` class. The issue arises when the `_marker_function` attribute is not None, and the function attempts to call it without checking its return value. This leads to incorrect initialization of attributes, resulting in the failing test case.

### Bug Cause
- The `_marker_function` attribute is called without checking if it exists or returns a valid value.
- The `is_filled` method fails in the test due to incorrect initialization of the `_filled` attribute while expecting it to be `False`.

### Bug Fix Strategy
- Check if `_marker_function` exists and is callable before attempting to call it.
- Ensure that the `_filled` attribute is set to the correct value based on the `fillstyle` parameter.

### The Corrected Version
```python
class MarkerStyle():
    def _recache(self):
        if self._marker_function is not None and callable(self._marker_function):
            self._path = _empty_path
            self._transform = IdentityTransform()
            self._alt_path = None
            self._alt_transform = None
            self._snap_threshold = float('inf')
            self._joinstyle = 'round'
            self._capstyle = 'butt'
            self._filled = self._fillstyle != 'none'
```

With this corrected version, the `MarkerStyle` class will reinitialize its attributes correctly, and the failing test case related to `is_filled` method should pass as expected.
