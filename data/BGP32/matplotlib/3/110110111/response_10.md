To fix the buggy function `_recache` in the `MarkerStyle` class, we need to make sure that the `is_filled` method correctly reflects the value of the `_filled` attribute.

Here is the corrected version of the `_recache` function:

```python
class MarkerStyle():

    def _recache(self):
        if self._marker_function is None:
            return
        self._path = _empty_path
        self._transform = IdentityTransform()
        self._alt_path = None
        self._alt_transform = None
        self._snap_threshold = float('inf')
        self._joinstyle = 'round'
        self._capstyle = 'butt'
        self._filled = self._fillstyle != 'none'  # Updated line
        self._marker_function()
```

Explanation:
1. In the original buggy function, the `_filled` attribute was set to `True` unconditionally, which was incorrect. We need to update this line to correctly reflect whether the fillstyle is set to 'none'.
2. By checking if the fillstyle is not 'none', we can accurately determine whether the marker should be filled or not.

By making this change, the `MarkerStyle` class will now accurately represent the fillstyle setting, and the failing test should pass as expected.
