## Analyzing the buggy function

The `MarkerStyle` class in the `markers.py` file contains a `_recache` function that is supposed to reinitialize certain attributes. The buggy part is where it attempts to call `self._marker_function()` without checking if it exists or not.

The failing test `test_marker_fillstyle` in the `test_marker.py` file creates a `MarkerStyle` object with `fillstyle='none'` and expects it to not be filled. The test fails because the `is_filled` method returns `True` due to the `_marker_function` being called.

The expected state of the variables before returning from `_recache` function includes `self._filled` set to `False`, but it mistakenly gets set to `True`.

## Potential error locations

The bug seems to be caused by the call to a non-existing `_marker_function` method. This results in `self._filled` being set to `True` unexpectedly.

## Bug cause

The bug is due to the existence of `self._marker_function()` being called while it's never defined, causing the `self._filled` attribute to incorrectly stay as `True`.

## Bug fixing strategy

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that `_recache` function operates correctly when `_marker_function` is not defined. We can modify the function to directly set `self._filled` based on the provided `fillstyle` rather than relying on a non-existing method.

## The corrected version of the function

```python
class MarkerStyle():
    def _recache(self):
        if self._marker_function is None:
            return
        self._path = _empty_path
        self._transform = IdentityTransform()
        self._alt_path = None
        self._alt_transform = None
        self._snap_threshold = None
        self._joinstyle = 'round'
        self._capstyle = 'butt'
        self._filled = self._fillstyle != 'none'
``` 

By directly setting `self._filled` based on the `fillstyle` attribute, we can ensure that the correct value is assigned even when `_marker_function` is not defined.
