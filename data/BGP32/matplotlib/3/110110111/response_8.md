## Analysis
The `_recache` function in the `MarkerStyle` class is failing to correctly set the `_filled` attribute to `False` even when `fillstyle` is set to `'none'`. This causes the `is_filled()` method to return `True` instead of `False` as expected.

## Potential Error Locations
The bug is likely arising from the line `self._filled = True`, always setting `_filled` to `True` regardless of the `fillstyle` setting.

## Bug Cause
The `_recache` function is not correctly updating the `_filled` attribute based on the `fillstyle` parameter. This leads to the `is_filled()` method returning `True` when it should return `False`.

## Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to update the logic in the `_recache` function to properly set the `_filled` attribute based on the value of `fillstyle`.

## The corrected version of the function
```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: lib/matplotlib/markers.py

# The declaration of the class containing the corrected function
class MarkerStyle():
    def _recache(self):
        if self._marker_function is None:
            return

        self._path = _empty_path
        self._transform = IdentityTransform()
        self._alt_path = None
        self._alt_transform = None
        self._snap_threshold = None
        self._joinstyle = 'round'
        self._capstyle = 'butt'

        if self._fillstyle == 'none':
            self._filled = False
        else:
            self._filled = True

        self._marker_function()
```

By adding the conditional check to update the `_filled` attribute based on the `fillstyle` parameter, we ensure that when `fillstyle` is set to `'none'`, the marker will be considered hollow and `_filled` will be set to `False`. This correction should address the issue raised in the GitHub report and pass the failing test.
