## Analysis
The buggy function `_recache` in the `MarkerStyle` class is not correctly handling the case where the `_marker_function` is `None`. This leads to the `_marker_function` being called even when it should not, causing unexpected behavior in the test case where `fillstyle='none'`.

## Bug Explanation
In the provided test case, the `MarkerStyle` is created with `fillstyle='none'`, which should result in a non-filled marker. However, due to the bug in the `_recache` function, the `_marker_function` is always called even when it is `None`, leading to the marker being filled unexpectedly.

The error message indicates that the `is_filled` method of `MarkerStyle` returns `True` when it should return `False`, causing the assertion to fail.

## Bug Fix Strategy
To fix this bug, we need to ensure that if `_marker_function` is `None`, it should not be called in the `_recache` function. We can add a simple check before calling `_marker_function` to prevent this issue.

## The corrected version of the function
```python
class MarkerStyle():
    def _recache(self):
        if self._marker_function is None:
            return
        self._path = _empty_path
        self._transform = IdentityTransform()
        self._alt_path = None
        self._alt_transform = None
        self._snap_threshold = None
        self._joinstyle = 'round'
        self._capstyle = 'butt'
        self._filled = True
        if self._marker_function is not None:
            self._marker_function()
```

By adding the `if self._marker_function is not None:` check before calling `_marker_function`, we ensure that it is only called when it is not `None`, preventing the unexpected behavior related to `fillstyle='none'`.
