### Analysis
The buggy function `_recache` in the `MarkerStyle` class is supposed to set default values for several attributes of the class instance. The error arises from the fact that the `self._filled` attribute is mistakenly set to `True` regardless of the `fillstyle` parameter value provided in the `MarkerStyle` instantiation. This leads to the failing test since `is_filled()` checks against this `self._filled` attribute.

### Error Location
The main cause of the bug is the incorrect assignment of `self._filled = True` in the `_recache` function.

### Bug Explanation
The failing test provides a `MarkerStyle` instance with `fillstyle='none'`, which should result in a hollow marker. However, despite setting `fillstyle` correctly, `is_filled()` returns `True`, indicating that the marker is being filled. This happens due to `self._filled` always being set to `True` inside `_recache`, leading to inconsistent behavior.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To resolve this bug, we need to update the `_recache` function to correctly handle the `fillstyle` argument. If `fillstyle` is set to `'none'`, we should ensure that `self._filled` is set to `False` to represent a hollow marker.

### Corrected Version
```python
class MarkerStyle():
    def _recache(self):
        if self._marker_function is None:
            return
        self._path = _empty_path
        self._transform = IdentityTransform()
        self._alt_path = None
        self._alt_transform = None
        self._snap_threshold = None
        self._joinstyle = 'round'
        self._capstyle = 'butt'
        self._filled = self._fillstyle != 'none'  # Update filled based on fillstyle
        self._marker_function()
```

By updating the assignment of `self._filled` to check against the `fillstyle` value, the corrected version of the `_recache` function ensures that the `MarkerStyle` instance behaves as expected based on the input parameters, resolving the bug.
