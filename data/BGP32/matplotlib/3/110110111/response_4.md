## Analysis
The buggy function `_recache(self)` in the `MarkerStyle` class is supposed to reinitialize the attributes of the `MarkerStyle` object. However, in its current state, it seems to be missing the proper initialization for the `_filled` attribute based on the marker function.

The failing test `test_marker_fillstyle()` aims to create a `MarkerStyle` object with `fillstyle='none'` and then check if it is empty or not. The failing assertion occurs when checking if the marker is filled or not, indicating an issue with the `_filled` attribute.

The expected values and types of variables indicate that the `_filled` attribute should be set to `False` when the `fillstyle='none'`.

## Bug Location
The bug is likely located in the incomplete initialization of the `_filled` attribute within the `_recache` function.

## Bug Explanation
The failing test fails because the `_filled` attribute is not properly set to `False` when `fillstyle='none'`. As a result, the assertion checking if the marker is filled or not fails, leading to the AssertionError.

## Proposed Fix
To fix this bug, you need to update the `_filled` attribute to match the expected value when `fillstyle='none'`. This adjustment should be made within the `_recache` function.

## Corrected Version
```python
class MarkerStyle():
    def _recache(self):
        if self._marker_function is None:
            return
        self._path = _empty_path
        self._transform = IdentityTransform()
        self._alt_path = None
        self._alt_transform = None
        self._snap_threshold = None
        self._joinstyle = 'round'
        self._capstyle = 'butt'
        self._filled = self._fillstyle != 'none'  # Update _filled attribute
        self._marker_function()
```

By updating the `_filled` attribute based on the `fillstyle` value, this corrected version of the `_recache` function should now properly set the `_filled` attribute to `False` when `fillstyle='none'`. This fix should resolve the failing test case and satisfy the expected input/output values.
