## Analysis
The buggy function `_recache` in the `MarkerStyle` class is supposed to reset certain attributes to default values when called. However, there seems to be an issue with the `self._filled` attribute. The buggy function is currently setting `self._filled = True` unconditionally, which contradicts the expected behavior.

In the failing test, the assertion checks whether `marker_style.is_filled()` returns `False`, but due to the bug in the `_recache` function, `self._filled` is always set to `True`, causing the assertion to fail.

## Bug Cause
The bug in the `_recache` function arises from unconditionally setting `self._filled = True`, regardless of the `fillstyle` parameter passed during `MarkerStyle` instantiation. This causes the `is_filled` method to always return `True`, leading to test failures.

## Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the `self._filled` attribute is set based on the `fillstyle` parameter provided during `MarkerStyle` initialization. If `fillstyle` is set to `'none'`, `self._filled` should be set to `False`.

## Corrected Version
```python
class MarkerStyle():
    def _recache(self):
        if self._marker_function is None:
            return
        self._path = _empty_path
        self._transform = IdentityTransform()
        self._alt_path = None
        self._alt_transform = None
        self._snap_threshold = None
        self._joinstyle = 'round'
        self._capstyle = 'butt'
        self._filled = self._fillstyle != 'none'
        self._marker_function()
```

By updating the assignment of `self._filled` based on the value of `self._fillstyle`, we ensure that the `is_filled` method returns the correct value based on the `fillstyle` parameter set during `MarkerStyle` initialization. This correction should resolve the issue and make the failing test pass.
