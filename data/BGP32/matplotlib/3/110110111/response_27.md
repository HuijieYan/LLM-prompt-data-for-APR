## Analysis
1. The `MarkerStyle` class has a `_recache` method that should reinitialize certain attributes when called. However, there seems to be an issue with the implementation as the marker function `_marker_function` is not properly executed in the current buggy code.
2. The failing test `test_marker_fillstyle` initiates a `MarkerStyle` instance with a marker and `fillstyle='none'`. It then checks if the `is_filled()` method returns `False`, indicating that the marker should be hollow. This test fails due to the buggy implementation in the `_recache` method.
3. The error message indicates that the `is_filled()` method returns `True` instead of `False`, leading to an assertion failure. This behavior contradicts the expected outcome described in the failing test.

## Bug Cause
The bug is caused by the `_recache` method not correctly managing the `self._filled` attribute based on the provided `fillstyle`. The method fails to update `self._filled` based on the conditions set in the initialization. This results in the `is_filled()` method returning `True` instead of `False`, leading to test failure and markers not appearing as hollow when expected.

## Fix Strategy
To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the `_recache` method correctly sets the `self._filled` attribute based on the provided `fillstyle`. If the `fillstyle` is 'none', the marker should be considered hollow (`self._filled = False`). We should also ensure that the `is_filled()` method correctly reflects this attribute.

## Corrected Version
```python
class MarkerStyle():
    def _recache(self):
        if self._marker_function is None:
            return
        self._path = _empty_path
        self._transform = IdentityTransform()
        self._alt_path = None
        self._alt_transform = None
        self._snap_threshold = None
        self._joinstyle = 'round'
        self._capstyle = 'butt'
        self._filled = True if self._fillstyle != 'none' else False  # Update filled based on fillstyle
        self._marker_function()
```

By making the above change in the `_recache` method, the `self._filled` attribute will be correctly updated when the fillstyle is 'none', ensuring that markers appear as hollow when expected. This adjustment should resolve the bug and make the failing test pass as well as address the issue reported on GitHub.
