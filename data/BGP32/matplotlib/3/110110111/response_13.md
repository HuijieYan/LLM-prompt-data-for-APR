## Analysis
The buggy function `_recache` in the `MarkerStyle` class is intended to reset various attributes to default values under certain conditions. In this case, the condition checked is `if self._marker_function is None`, and if it is not `None`, the function `_marker_function` is called.

The failing test `test_marker_fillstyle` tries to create a `MarkerStyle` object with `fillstyle='none'` and then checks if `is_filled` method returns `False`.

The error message indicates that the assertion `assert not marker_style.is_filled()` fails, implying that the `is_filled` method is returning `True` even though the `fillstyle` is set to `'none'`. This suggests that the condition `self._filled = True` inside the `_recache` function is not being correctly updated.

## Bug
The cause of the bug seems to be that the `self._filled` attribute is being set to `True` unconditionally within the `_recache` function, regardless of the `fillstyle` parameter. This leads to incorrect behavior when checking for filling of markers.

## Fix
To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the `self._filled` attribute is updated based on the `fillstyle` parameter. If `fillstyle` is set to `'none'`, then `self._filled` should be set to `False`. 

Here is the corrected version of the `_recache` function in the `MarkerStyle` class:

```python
class MarkerStyle():
    def _recache(self):
        if self._marker_function is None:
            return
        self._path = _empty_path
        self._transform = IdentityTransform()
        self._alt_path = None
        self._alt_transform = None
        self._snap_threshold = None
        self._joinstyle = 'round'
        self._capstyle = 'butt'
        
        # Update filled attribute based on fillstyle
        if self._fillstyle == 'none':
            self._filled = False
        else:
            self._filled = True
        
        self._marker_function()
```

With this correction, the `_filled` attribute will be updated correctly based on the `fillstyle` parameter, allowing the test to pass as expected.
