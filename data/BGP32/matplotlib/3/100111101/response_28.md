The bug in the `_recache` function is that it is not correctly setting the `_filled` attribute based on the `fillstyle` parameter provided. The function assumes `_filled` should always be set to `True` which leads to the test failure.

To fix the bug, we need to update the `_recache` function to correctly set the `_filled` attribute based on the `fillstyle` parameter.

Here is the corrected version of the `_recache` function:
```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    self._filled = self._fillstyle != 'none'
    self._marker_function()
```

With this correction, the function will correctly set the `_filled` attribute based on the `fillstyle` parameter, allowing the test to pass successfully.
