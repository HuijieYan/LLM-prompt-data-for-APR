The issue in the `_recache` function is that it always sets `_filled` to `True`, regardless of the fillstyle specified. This results in the failing test where `is_filled` returns `True` instead of `False` when `fillstyle='none'`.

To fix this bug, we need to update the `_recache` function to set `_filled` based on the fillstyle provided.

Here is the corrected version of the `_recache` function:

```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    self._filled = self._fillstyle != 'none'  # Update _filled based on fillstyle
    self._marker_function()
```

With this correction, the `_filled` attribute will be set based on the `fillstyle` provided, and the failing test should now pass as expected.
