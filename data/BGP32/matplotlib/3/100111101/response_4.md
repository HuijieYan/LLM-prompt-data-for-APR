## Bug Analysis
The buggy function `_recache` is setting the `_filled` attribute to `True` unconditionally, which is not ideal. This leads to the failing test `assert not marker_style.is_filled()` failing because `_filled` is always set to `True`, irrespective of the `fillstyle` provided.

## Bug Explanation
The failing test is checking if the marker style is filled or not using the `is_filled()` method. However, the `_recache` function sets the `_filled` attribute to `True` unconditionally, causing the `is_filled()` method to always return `True`. This leads to the failing test since the expected behavior is to return `False` when `fillstyle` is set to `'none'`.

## Bug Fix
To fix the bug, we need to set the `_filled` attribute based on the provided `fillstyle`. If the `fillstyle` is set to `'none'`, we should set `_filled` to `False`.

## Corrected Buggy Function
```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    
    # Check fillstyle and set _filled accordingly
    if self._fillstyle == 'none':
        self._filled = False
    else:
        self._filled = True
    
    self._marker_function()
``` 

By updating the `_recache` function to consider the `fillstyle` when setting `_filled`, we ensure that the marker style behaves correctly according to the provided `fillstyle`. This fix will make the failing test `test_marker_fillstyle` pass.
