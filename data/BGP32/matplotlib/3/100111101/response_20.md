### Analysis:
The `_recache` function seems to be resetting several attributes of an object to default values and then calling a marker function. The failing test is related to the `is_filled` method returning `True` when it should be `False`. This suggests that the `_filled` attribute is not being set correctly.

### Bug:
The bug lies in the fact that the `_filled` attribute is always set to `True` in the `_recache` function, regardless of the `fillstyle` parameter passed to the object.

### Fix:
We need to ensure that the `_filled` attribute is correctly set based on the `fillstyle` parameter passed when initializing the object.

### Corrected Version:

```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    
    # Set _filled based on fillstyle
    if self._fillstyle in ['full', 'left', 'right']:
        self._filled = True
    else:
        self._filled = False
    
    self._marker_function()
```

By setting the `_filled` attribute based on the `fillstyle`, we ensure that the attribute reflects the expected value in the failing test. This correction should make the test pass successfully.
