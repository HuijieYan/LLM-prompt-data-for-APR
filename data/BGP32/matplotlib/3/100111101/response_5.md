The buggy function `_recache` is not updating the `_filled` variable correctly, resulting in the failing test case where `assert not marker_style.is_filled()` fails since the `_filled` variable is not being updated to `False`.

To fix this issue, we need to set `_filled` to `False` when the `fillstyle` is `'none'`. This can be achieved by modifying the `_recache` function as follows:

```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    self._filled = self._fillstyle != 'none'
    self._marker_function()
```

By updating the `_filled` variable based on the `fillstyle` value, we ensure that the correct value is set according to the expected behavior.

With this correction, the `_recache` function should now properly update the `_filled` variable based on the `fillstyle`, allowing the failing test `test_marker_fillstyle` to pass.
