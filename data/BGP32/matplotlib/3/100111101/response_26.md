The bug in the `_recache` function is causing the failing test `test_marker_fillstyle` to not pass. The bug is likely due to the `self._filled` attribute being set to `True` unconditionally, which contradicts the expected behavior of the `MarkerStyle` object created in the test.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the `self._filled` attribute reflects the actual fillstyle of the marker, which in this case should be `False` when `fillstyle='none'`.

Here is the corrected version of the `_recache` function:

```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    self._filled = (self._fillstyle != 'none')  # Update filled based on fillstyle
    self._marker_function()
```

By updating the `_filled` attribute based on the fillstyle, the corrected function should now pass the failing test and produce the expected output.

Please replace the existing `_recache` function with this corrected version in the `markers.py` file to resolve the issue.
