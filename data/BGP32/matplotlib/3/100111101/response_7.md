### Analysis
The `_recache` function sets various attributes to specific values, but it fails to update the `_filled` attribute to `False` as expected. This results in the failing test `test_marker_fillstyle()` asserting that `marker_style.is_filled()` should return `False` but it returns `True` because the `_filled` attribute is not updated correctly.

### Bug Cause
The bug is caused by the `_recache` function not updating the `_filled` attribute to `False` as expected. This causes the failing test to assert the wrong value when checking if the marker is filled or not.

### Bug Fix
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the `_filled` attribute is set to `False` in the `_recache` function.

### Corrected Version
```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    self._filled = False  # Update _filled attribute to False
    self._marker_function()
```
