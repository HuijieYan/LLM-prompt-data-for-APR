## Bug Explanation
The bug occurs because the `_recache` function does not properly update the `_filled` attribute according to the expected values. The function sets `_filled` to `True` unconditionally, regardless of the fillstyle specified in the MarkerStyle object, leading to the assertion error in the failing test.

## Bug Fix
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the `_filled` attribute reflects the correct value based on the fillstyle specified in the MarkerStyle object.

Here is the corrected version of the `_recache` function:

```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    
    if self._fillstyle == 'none':
        self._filled = False
    else:
        self._filled = True
        
    self._marker_function()
```

By adding the condition to check if the fillstyle is 'none' and setting `_filled` accordingly, we ensure that the correct value is assigned to `_filled` based on the fillstyle specified in the MarkerStyle object.

This fix should allow the corrected function to pass the failing test and satisfy the expected input/output values.
