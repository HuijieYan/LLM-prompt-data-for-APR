### Analysis:
The buggy function `_recache` is not properly setting the `_filled` attribute, which is causing the failing test `test_marker_fillstyle` to fail. The error message indicates that the assertion `assert not marker_style.is_filled()` is not passing because the `is_filled` method is returning `True` instead of `False`.

### Potential Error Location:
The issue is likely with the `_filled` attribute not being set correctly in the `_recache` function.

### Cause of the Bug:
The bug is caused by not setting the `_filled` attribute in the `_recache` function, which defaults to `True`. As a result, the `is_filled` method always returns `True`.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to update the `_recache` function to correctly set the `_filled` attribute based on the `fillstyle` parameter received when creating `MarkerStyle`.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: lib/matplotlib/markers.py

def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    self._filled = (self.get_fillstyle() != 'none')  # Update fillstyle based on parameter
    self._marker_function()
```

By updating the `_recache` function to properly set the `_filled` attribute based on the `fillstyle` parameter, the corrected version should address the bug and allow the test `test_marker_fillstyle` to pass successfully.
