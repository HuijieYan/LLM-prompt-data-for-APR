## Analysis:
The buggy function `_recache` sets the attributes of a marker object to default values and then calls the `_marker_function`. The issue is that the `_marker_function` is called regardless of whether it exists or not. This leads to the error message because the `MarkerStyle` object does not define the `_marker_function` method.

## Bug Cause:
The bug is caused by calling a non-existent `_marker_function` method on the `MarkerStyle` object, which results in a `AttributeError` when the test tries to access the `is_filled` method.

## Suggested Fix:
To fix the bug, we need to check if `_marker_function` exists before calling it in the `_recache` function. If it does not exist, we skip calling it.

## Corrected Version:
```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    self._filled = True
    if hasattr(self, '_marker_function'):
        self._marker_function()
``` 

With this corrected version, the `_marker_function` will only be called if it exists, avoiding the AttributeError and making the test pass successfully.
