## Analysis:
1. The `_recache` function in `markers.py` is supposed to recache marker properties, but it is missing some important steps that could lead to errors when trying to access these properties.
2. The failing test `test_marker_fillstyle` is checking if the marker is filled correctly, and it fails due to missing implementation in the `_recache` function.
3. The error message shows that the `is_filled` method is not properly implemented, leading to unexpected behavior.
4. To fix the issue, we need to ensure that the `_filled` attribute is set based on the `fillstyle` parameter passed during initialization of the `MarkerStyle` object.

## Suggestions for fixing the bug:
1. Modify the `_recache` function to initialize the `_filled` attribute based on the `fillstyle` parameter.
2. Update the `is_filled` method to return the correct value based on the `_filled` attribute.

## Corrected version of the `_recache` function:
```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    self._filled = self.fillstyle != 'none'  # Set _filled based on fillstyle
    self._marker_function()
```

## Updated `is_filled` method:
```python
def is_filled(self):
    return self._filled
```

By updating the `_recache` function to set the `_filled` attribute correctly based on the `fillstyle` parameter and implementing the `is_filled` method to return this attribute, the corrected version should now pass the failing test.
