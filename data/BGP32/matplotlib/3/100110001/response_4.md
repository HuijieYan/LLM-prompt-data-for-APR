### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_recache` is part of the `MarkerStyle` class in the `markers.py` file of `matplotlib`.
2. The failing test `test_marker_fillstyle` checks the `is_filled` method of `MarkerStyle`.
3. The error message indicates that the `is_filled` method is returning `True` unexpectedly.
4. The bug seems to be related to the initialization of `_filled` attribute in the `_recache` function.

### Bug Cause:
The `_filled` attribute is being set to `True` unconditionally in the `_recache` function. Since the `is_filled` method checks if `_filled` is `True`, it always returns `True`, causing the failing assertion in the test.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix this bug, we need to make sure that the `_filled` attribute is set based on the provided `fillstyle` in the `MarkerStyle` constructor. If `fillstyle` is equal to `'none'`, then `_filled` should be set to `False`.

### Corrected Version of `_recache` function:
```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    self._filled = self._fillstyle != 'none'
    self._marker_function()
```

By updating the `_filled` attribute based on the `fillstyle` provided in the `MarkerStyle` constructor, we ensure that the `is_filled` method behaves correctly according to the specified `fillstyle`. With this correction, the failing test `test_marker_fillstyle` should pass successfully.
