### Analysis:
1. The function `_recache` in `markers.py` is incomplete and missing a necessary check to ensure that the `_marker_function` attribute is callable before invoking it.
2. The error occurs because the `_marker_function` is being called without any check, leading to issues with setting `self._filled` attribute.
3. The error message points out that the `is_filled` method is returning `True` unexpectedly, causing the assertion failure.
4. To fix the bug, we need to ensure that `_marker_function` is callable and only call it if it exists. Additionally, we need to set `self._filled` based on the `fillstyle` parameter passed during initialization.

### Updated Corrected Version:
```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: lib/matplotlib/markers.py

def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None or not callable(self._marker_function):
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    self._filled = self.get_fillstyle() != 'none'
    self._marker_function()
```
In this corrected version, we added a check to see if `_marker_function` exists and is callable before proceeding with the recache process. Additionally, we set the `_filled` attribute based on the `fillstyle` value provided during initialization. This should ensure that the error in the failing test is resolved.
