### Analysis:
The `_recache` function in the `markers.py` file is not properly setting the `_filled` attribute to the correct value. This leads to the failing test in `test_marker_fillstyle` where it expects `False` for `marker_style.is_filled()` but receives `True`.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is caused by the `_filled` attribute not being set correctly within the `_recache` function, causing the `is_filled` method to return the wrong value. This leads to the failing test and the AssertionError.

### Bug Fix:
To fix the bug, we need to correctly set the `_filled` attribute to match the expected fillstyle chosen when creating the `MarkerStyle` object.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    self._filled = self._fillstyle is not None and self._fillstyle.lower() != 'none'  # Updated line
    self._marker_function()
``` 

By updating the `_filled` attribute to reflect the correct fillstyle, we ensure that the `is_filled()` method behaves as expected and the failing test should pass.
