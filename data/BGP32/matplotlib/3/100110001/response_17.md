### Analysis:
The `_recache` function initializes various attributes to default values and then calls a `_marker_function` method. However, in the provided code snippet, the `_marker_function` is called without checking if it exists. This can lead to errors when the `MarkerStyle` instance is created with specific attributes that require `_marker_function` to be defined.

### Error Location:
The error is occurring in the `test_marker_fillstyle` function from the test code. It fails when checking if the marker style is not filled (`assert not marker_style.is_filled()`).

### Cause of the Bug:
The bug occurs because the `_recache` function initializes the `_filled` attribute to `True` unconditionally, and the `is_filled` method checks this attribute. Since `_recache` is called without setting the correct value for `is_filled`, it always returns `True`, leading to the test failure.

### Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the `_marker_function` is correctly defined to set the value of `_filled` attribute based on the `fillstyle` attribute of the `MarkerStyle` instance. This will allow the `is_filled` method to correctly determine if the marker is filled or not.

### Corrected Version:
```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: lib/matplotlib/markers.py

def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    if self._marker_function:
        self._filled = self._marker_function().filled
    else:
        self._filled = True
``` 

In the corrected version, the `_recache` function checks if the `_marker_function` is defined before calling it. If it exists, it sets the `_filled` attribute based on the return value of `_marker_function()` which is assumed to have a `filled` attribute. Otherwise, it defaults to `True`. This approach ensures that the correct value for `_filled` is set based on the `_marker_function`.
