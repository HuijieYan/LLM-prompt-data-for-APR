### Analysis:
The `_recache` function in `markers.py` is not correctly handling the case when `_marker_function` is None. This leads to an issue where the function `marker_style.is_filled()` is being called without `_marker_function` being set. As a result, the test is failing with the error message stating that `not True` is being asserted.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is caused by `_recache` function not properly checking if `_marker_function` is None before calling it. This results in an error when trying to access `is_filled()` without having `_marker_function` initialized.

### Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to modify the `_recache` function to check if `_marker_function` is not None before calling it. If `_marker_function` is None, then there is no need to execute it.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    self._filled = True
    self._marker_function()
``` 

After making this change, the `_recache` function will correctly handle the case when `_marker_function` is None, preventing the error from occurring.
