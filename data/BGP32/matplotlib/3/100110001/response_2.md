## Analysis:
1. The `_recache` function is not properly handling the case where `_marker_function` is `None`.
2. In the failing test, the `is_filled()` method is not behaving as expected due to the incorrect initialization in `_recache`.

## Bug Cause:
The bug is caused by the fact that when `_marker_function` is `None`, the `_marker_function()` call in `_recache` does not get skipped. This leads to incorrect initialization of attributes like `_filled`, causing the `is_filled()` method to return an unexpected value.

## Fix:
To fix the bug, we should check if `_marker_function` is not `None` before calling it in `_recache`. Additionally, we should properly set the `_filled` attribute based on the `fillstyle` provided during MarkerStyle initialization.

## Corrected Version:
```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    if self.get_fillstyle() in ('full', 'left', 'right'):
        self._filled = True
    else:
        self._filled = False
    self._marker_function()
```

By adding a check for `_marker_function` and setting `_filled` based on the `fillstyle` in the MarkerStyle object, the corrected version should resolve the bug and pass the failing test.
