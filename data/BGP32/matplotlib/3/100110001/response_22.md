### Analysis
The `_recache` function in the `markers.py` module does not set the `_marker_function` attribute, leading to a situation where it is `None` and the function tries to call it. This results in an error when trying to access the `is_filled()` method in the test scenario.

### Bug Identification
The bug lies in the fact that the `_marker_function` attribute has not been set before calling it. This leads to the `AssertionError` when trying to access `is_filled()`.

### Bug Explanation
The `MarkerStyle` object is created with the fillstyle set as `'none'`, but when the `_recache` function is called, it attempts to execute an undefined `marker_function`. This leaves the internal state of `MarkerStyle` inconsistent, causing the `is_filled()` method to return `True` erroneously.

### Bug Fix
To fix this bug, we need to ensure that `_marker_function` is set correctly before calling it. One way to achieve this is by setting it appropriately during the initialization of `MarkerStyle`.

### Corrected Version of `_recache` Function
```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return

    # Set the marker function to handle internal settings
    self._marker_function = self._set_marker_function()

    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    self._filled = True

    self._marker_function()
```

In this corrected version, we ensure that `_marker_function` is set to the appropriate value before calling it in the `_recache` function. This change should resolve the issue observed in the failing test.
