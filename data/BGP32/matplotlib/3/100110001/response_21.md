### Analysis:
The `_recache` function in the `markers.py` file is meant to reinitialize certain parameters related to markers in Matplotlib. However, the bug lies in the fact that when `_marker_function` is called, it leads to an assertion error in the test function `test_marker_fillstyle` as it fails to correctly update the `_filled` attribute.

### Potential Error Locations:
The bug is likely occurring due to how the `_marker_function` is set up, which doesn't properly update the `_filled` attribute.

### Cause of the Bug:
The bug is caused by improper handling of `_filled` attribute in the `_recache` function. When `_marker_function` is called, it doesn't correctly update the `_filled` attribute, leading to the failing assertion error in the test function. The error message displays that the `is_filled` method is returning `True`, causing the assertion error.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that when `_marker_function` is called, the `_filled` attribute is correctly updated. This can be achieved by setting `_filled` to `False` before calling `_marker_function`.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    self._filled = False  # Update _filled attribute
    self._marker_function()
```

By updating the `_filled` attribute to `False` before calling `_marker_function`, the corrected version should now pass the failing test.
