The bug in the `_recache` function lies in the fact that it calls `self._marker_function()` without checking if `self._marker_function` is not `None`. This causes an error when trying to call the method that does not exist, leading to a failure in the test where the `MarkerStyle` object is being used.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that `_recache` function only calls `_marker_function` if it is not `None`. We can achieve this by adding a check before calling `_marker_function`. 

Here is the corrected version of the `_recache` function:

```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is not None:
        self._path = _empty_path
        self._transform = IdentityTransform()
        self._alt_path = None
        self._alt_transform = None
        self._snap_threshold = None
        self._joinstyle = 'round'
        self._capstyle = 'butt'
        self._filled = True
        self._marker_function()
```

With this correction, the `_recache` function will only call `_marker_function` if it exists, resolving the error in the test function provided.
