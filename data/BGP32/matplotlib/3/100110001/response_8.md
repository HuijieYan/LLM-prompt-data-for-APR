### Analysis:
1. The `_recache` function in `markers.py` is not properly initializing the `_filled` attribute which is causing the `is_filled` method to return `True` even when it should be `False`.
2. The failing test is checking if the marker is not filled, but due to the incorrect initialization in `_recache`, it fails.
3. The error message indicates that the `is_filled` method is returning `True` when it should actually return `False`.
   
### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the `_filled` attribute is correctly initialized in the `_recache` function based on the `fillstyle` provided when defining the `MarkerStyle`.
   
### Corrected Version:
```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    self._filled = self.get_fillstyle() != 'none'
    self._marker_function()
``` 

With this corrected version, the `_filled` attribute will be initialized correctly based on the `fillstyle`, resolving the issue and allowing the failing test to pass.
