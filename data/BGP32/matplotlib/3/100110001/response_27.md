## Analysis
1. The `_recache` function in `markers.py` sets several attributes to default values, then calls a marker function. The error arises when the `marker_function` method is called without properly setting up the required attributes.
2. The failing test `test_marker_fillstyle` checks the `is_filled` method of `MarkerStyle` object, which is not functioning correctly due to the bug in `_recache`.
3. The error message indicates that the test failed because the `is_filled` method did not return `False` as expected.
4. The bug can be fixed by ensuring that the necessary attributes are correctly initialized before invoking the `_marker_function`.

## Proposed Fix
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the `self._filled` attribute is set correctly before calling `_marker_function`. Here's the corrected version of the `_recache` function:

```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    self._filled = False  # Corrected attribute initialization
    self._marker_function()
```

By ensuring that the `_filled` attribute is set to `False` before calling the `_marker_function`, the corrected version should pass the failing test `test_marker_fillstyle`.
