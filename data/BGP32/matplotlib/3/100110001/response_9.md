### Analysis:
The buggy function `_recache` is missing an implementation for `_marker_function`. This function is called at the end of the `_recache` method, but it is not defined in the provided code snippet. This causes the failing test `test_marker_fillstyle` to encounter an error when checking the `is_filled` method of `MarkerStyle` object because the `_marker_function` is not properly setting up the object.

### Potential Error Location:
The bug is likely in the missing implementation of `_marker_function` within the `MarkerStyle` class.

### Cause of the Bug:
The bug is caused by the `_marker_function` not being defined within the `_recache` method. This leaves the `MarkerStyle` object in an incomplete state, leading to a failed assertion in the test that checks for the filled state of the marker.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
1. Define `_marker_function` within the `MarkerStyle` class, ensuring that it properly initializes the object with all required attributes for a marker.
2. Ensure that the `_marker_function` sets the `is_filled` state correctly based on the marker's fill style.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: lib/matplotlib/markers.py

# corrected version of the buggy function
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    self._filled = True
    self._marker_function()
```

### Corrected Implementation of `_marker_function`:
Assuming the `_marker_function` is defined within the `MarkerStyle` class, you should provide a definition that properly initializes the marker state, including the fill style.

### Additional Steps:
Ensure that the `MarkerStyle` class includes a proper implementation of `_marker_function` to set up the object correctly. This should include setting the `is_filled` state based on the fill style provided during marker creation.

After making these changes, the corrected function should pass the failing test `test_marker_fillstyle`.
