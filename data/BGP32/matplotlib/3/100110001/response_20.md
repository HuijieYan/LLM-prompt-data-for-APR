### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_recache` is called on instances of `MarkerStyle`.
2. The test function `test_marker_fillstyle` is trying to test the `is_filled` method of `MarkerStyle` but it fails due to the `is_filled` method calling a function `self._marker_function()` that is not defined in the `_recache` method.
3. The error message states that `self._marker_function` is not defined.
4. To fix this bug, we need to define the `_marker_function` attribute in `MarkerStyle` and ensure that it is called in the `_recache` function before `self._filled` is set to `True`.

### Fix:
```python
# The fixed version of the function
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    self._marker_function()
    self._filled = True
```

By moving the call to `_marker_function()` before setting `self._filled = True`, we ensure that the function defined in `MarkerStyle` is called before checking if the marker style is filled. This change will fix the bug and make the test pass.
