### Analysis:
1. The `_recache` function in `markers.py` is being called from the `MarkerStyle` class. The function is resetting some internal parameters and then calling the `_marker_function` attribute, which seems to be undefined causing issues.
2. The failing test `test_marker_fillstyle` in `test_marker.py` is checking if the marker fillstyle is 'none' and if the marker is not filled.
3. The error message indicates that there is a problem with calling the `is_filled` method, suggesting that `marker_style.is_filled()` is not evaluating as expected.
4. To fix the bug, we need to ensure that `_marker_function` is defined in the `MarkerStyle` class, and also properly handle the conditions in the `_recache` function to avoid calling undefined functions.
5. We can modify the `_recache` function to set `_marker_function` if it is not already defined and then call it if it's set.

### Updated Corrected Version:
```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is not None:
        self._path = _empty_path
        self._transform = IdentityTransform()
        self._alt_path = None
        self._alt_transform = None
        self._snap_threshold = None
        self._joinstyle = 'round'
        self._capstyle = 'butt'
        self._filled = True
        self._marker_function()
```

By adding a check before calling `_marker_function`, this corrected version ensures that `_marker_function` is defined before being called, preventing the error encountered in the failing test.
