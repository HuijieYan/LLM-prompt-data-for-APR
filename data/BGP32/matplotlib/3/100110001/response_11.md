### Analysis:
1. The function `_recache` is a method of a class that was not provided in the code snippet but it seems like it should be part of a class definition.
2. The failing test `test_marker_fillstyle` is trying to create a `MarkerStyle` object and check if `is_filled()` method returns `False`.
3. The error message indicates that the `is_filled()` method is returning `True` instead of `False`.
4. The `_recache` function sets `_filled = True`, which might be causing the issue.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is caused by `_recache` setting `_filled = True` unconditionally. This overrides any default or alternate values set by the constructor. This leads to the `is_filled()` method always returning `True`, causing the test to fail.

### Fix Strategy:
To fix this bug, we need to modify the `_recache` method to consider any default or alternate values for `_filled` instead of setting it unconditionally.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    if self._filled is None:  # Check if filled is not set
        self._filled = True  # Set filled to True only if not set previously
    self._marker_function()
```

With this modification, the `_recache` method will only set `_filled` to `True` if it has not been previously set, allowing the constructor's value to be retained. This will ensure that the `is_filled()` method returns the correct value according to the constructor's input.

This corrected version should pass the failing test `test_marker_fillstyle`.
