### Analysis:
The `_recache` function in the `markers.py` file is not handling the case where `_marker_function` is not None properly. Currently, it skips the function call if `_marker_function` is None without setting the necessary attributes, leading to issues in the test.

### Bug Cause:
The bug occurs because the `_recache` function does not set the attributes `_filled` and `_marker_function` when `_marker_function` is None. This results in the `is_filled` method failing in the test due to `_filled` not being properly initialized.

### Strategy for fixing the bug:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that even if `_marker_function` is None, the necessary attributes like `_filled` are still initialized properly. One way to do this is to set a default value for `_filled` within the `_recache` function.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        self._filled = False
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    self._filled = True
    self._marker_function()
```

After applying this fix, the `_filled` attribute is set to False when `_marker_function` is None, ensuring that the `is_filled` method works correctly in the test case provided. This corrected version should pass the failing test.
