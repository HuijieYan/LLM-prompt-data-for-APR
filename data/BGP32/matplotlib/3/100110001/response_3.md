### Analysis:
The buggy function `_recache` is failing to initialize all attributes properly, resulting in the `MarkerStyle` object not being filled despite specifying `fillstyle='none'` in the test.

### Potential Error Locations:
The issue could be with the `_filled` attribute not being set correctly or the `_marker_function` not being initialized properly.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is caused by the `_filled` attribute being set to `True` inside the `_recache` function even when `fillstyle='none'` is specified. This causes the `is_filled` method to return `True` incorrectly, leading to the failed assertion.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that when `fillstyle='none'`, the `_filled` attribute should be set to `False` instead of `True`.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    self._filled = self.get_fillstyle() != 'none'
    self._marker_function()
```

With this correction, the `_filled` attribute will be correctly set based on the `fillstyle` specified, and the `is_filled` method will return the correct value. This should make the failing test pass successfully.
