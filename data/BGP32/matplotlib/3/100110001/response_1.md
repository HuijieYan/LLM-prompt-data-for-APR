The bug in the `_recache` function causes the `_marker_function` to be called regardless of the condition checking if it is `None`. This leads to unexpected behavior when creating `MarkerStyle` objects, as the `_marker_function` is being called when it shouldn't be.

To fix this bug, the `_marker_function` should only be called when it is not `None`. Here is the corrected version of the `_recache` function:

```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is not None:
        self._path = _empty_path
        self._transform = IdentityTransform()
        self._alt_path = None
        self._alt_transform = None
        self._snap_threshold = None
        self._joinstyle = 'round'
        self._capstyle = 'butt'
        self._filled = True
        self._marker_function()
```

By adding the `if self._marker_function is not None:` condition, the `_marker_function` will only be called when it is defined, fixing the bug and allowing the `MarkerStyle` objects to work correctly.

This corrected version of the `_recache` function should resolve the failing test and no longer result in the assertion error described in the error message.
