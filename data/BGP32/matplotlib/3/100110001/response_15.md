### Analysis:
The `_recache()` function in `lib/matplotlib/markers.py` is not properly assigning the `_filled` attribute a boolean value, causing the failing test to raise an error when checking if the marker is filled.

### Potential error locations:
The assignment of the `_filled` attribute to `True` in the `_recache()` function is incorrect, leading to the failing test.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is caused by assigning `self._filled = True` in the `_recache()` function of `lib/matplotlib/markers.py`, without considering the fillstyle parameter. This results in markers being marked as filled even when `fillstyle='none'` is specified.

### Strategy for fixing the bug:
1. Modify the `_recache()` function in `lib/matplotlib/markers.py` to take into account the `fillstyle` parameter and set the `_filled` attribute accordingly.
2. Ensure that the `_filled` attribute reflects the actual fill status of the marker, based on the `fillstyle` parameter provided.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    self._filled = self.get_fillstyle() != 'none'
    self._marker_function()
``` 

In the corrected version, the `_filled` attribute is assigned based on the `fillstyle` parameter, ensuring that the marker is correctly marked as filled or not filled accordingly. This change should resolve the bug and allow the failing test to pass successfully.
