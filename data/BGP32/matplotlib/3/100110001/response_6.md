### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_recache` is meant to handle the re-caching of marker properties in Matplotlib.
2. The provided test function `test_marker_fillstyle` is testing the `is_filled` method of the `MarkerStyle` class with a specific fillstyle.
3. The error message indicates that the assertion `assert not marker_style.is_filled()` failed, meaning the `is_filled` method returned `True` when it was expected to be `False`.

### Potential Error Location:
The issue might be with the initialization of the `_filled` attribute in the `_recache` function. If `_filled` is always set to `True`, regardless of the actual fill style, it would cause the `is_filled` method to return `True` even when it should be `False`.

### Cause of the Bug:
The bug occurs because the `_filled` attribute is always set to `True` in the `_recache` function, causing the `is_filled` method to return `True` incorrectly.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to update the `_recache` function to correctly set the `_filled` attribute based on the fill style provided when creating a `MarkerStyle` instance.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    self._filled = self._fillstyle != 'none'  # Update based on fillstyle
    self._marker_function()
```

By updating the `_filled` attribute based on the actual fill style provided, the corrected version of the `_recache` function will now consider the fill style correctly and fix the bug.
