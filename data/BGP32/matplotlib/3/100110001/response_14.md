### Analysis:
1. The `_recache` function is supposed to reset the marker style attributes and call the `_marker_function` method.
2. The failing test is checking if the `is_filled` method of the `MarkerStyle` object returns `False`, but it is returning `True`.
3. The error message indicates that the `is_filled` method is returning `True`, which is unexpected.
4. The bug is likely related to the implementation of the `is_filled` method in the `MarkerStyle` class.

### Bug:
The bug is likely in the implementation of the `MarkerStyle` class where the `is_filled` method is not returning the correct value or the `filled` attribute is not being set correctly when calling `_recache`.

### Fix Strategy:
1. Make sure that the `filled` attribute in the `MarkerStyle` class is set correctly within the `_recache` function.
2. Ensure that the `is_filled` method in the `MarkerStyle` class returns the correct value based on the `filled` attribute.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    self._filled = True if self._fillstyle != 'none' else False  # Set filled based on fillstyle
    self._marker_function()
```

By setting the `self._filled` attribute based on the `fillstyle`, the corrected version should fix the bug and make the failing test pass.
