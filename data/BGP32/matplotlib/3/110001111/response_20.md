## Analysis
1. The buggy function `_recache` of the `MarkerStyle` class does not correctly set the `_filled` attribute based on the presence of a `_marker_function`. As a result, the markers are not rendered as hollow when the `fillstyle='none'`.
2. The function initializes various attributes but fails to correctly handle the `_filled` attribute.
3. The bug causes markers to not appear hollow when the `fillstyle='none'` is set, contrary to the expected behavior where markers should be rendered hollow.
4. To fix the bug, we need to update the logic that determines the value of the `_filled` attribute based on the presence of a `_marker_function`.

## Bug Fix
```python
class MarkerStyle():
    def _recache(self):
        if self._marker_function is None:
            self._filled = False  # Update the filled attribute if no marker function is defined
            return
        self._path = _empty_path
        self._transform = IdentityTransform()
        self._alt_path = None
        self._alt_transform = None
        self._snap_threshold = None
        self._joinstyle = 'round'
        self._capstyle = 'butt'
        self._filled = True
        self._marker_function()
```

By adding the line `self._filled = False` when `_marker_function` is `None`, the bug is fixed. Now, if no `_marker_function` is defined, the markers will be rendered as hollow when `fillstyle='none'`.
