The bug in the `_recache` function is that it's setting `_filled` to `True` unconditionally at the end of the function, even if the `fillstyle` parameter is set to `'none'`. This results in markers not being hollow as expected.

### Bug Cause
The bug occurs because the `_filled` attribute is always set to `True` at the end of the function regardless of the `fillstyle` parameter value. This inconsistency causes the markers to be filled even when `fillstyle` is set to `'none'`.

### Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to update the logic in the `_recache` function to correctly handle the `fillstyle` parameter and set the `_filled` attribute accordingly.

### Corrected Version
Here is the corrected version of the `_recache` function:

```python
class MarkerStyle():
    def _recache(self):
        if self._marker_function is None:
            return
        self._path = _empty_path
        self._transform = IdentityTransform()
        self._alt_path = None
        self._alt_transform = None
        self._snap_threshold = None
        self._joinstyle = 'round'
        self._capstyle = 'butt'
        self._filled = self._fillstyle != 'none'  # Update filled attribute based on fillstyle
        self._marker_function()
```

By updating the `_filled` attribute based on the `fillstyle` parameter value, the markers will now be correctly filled or hollow as expected. This change addresses the issue reported on GitHub where setting `fillstyle='none'` was not resulting in hollow markers.
