### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_recache` in the `MarkerStyle` class is intended to reset various attributes to default values and call a marker function if it's not None.
2. The bug seems to be related to the `_filled` attribute not being correctly set to `False` as expected in some cases, leading to markers not being hollow when requested.
3. The GitHub issue suggests that setting `fillstyle='none'` should result in hollow markers, but it doesn't work as expected due to the incorrect setting of `_filled`.
4. To fix the bug, we need to ensure that `_filled` is set to `False` when the fill style is set to `'none'`.

### Bug Fix:
```python
class MarkerStyle():
    def _recache(self):
        if self._marker_function is None:
            return
        self._path = _empty_path
        self._transform = IdentityTransform()
        self._alt_path = None
        self._alt_transform = None
        self._snap_threshold = None
        self._joinstyle = 'round'
        self._capstyle = 'butt'
        
        # Fix the bug by setting _filled to False when fillstyle is 'none'
        if self.get_fillstyle() == 'none':
            self._filled = False
        else:
            self._filled = True
        
        self._marker_function()
```

By checking the `fillstyle` and setting `_filled` accordingly, the bug should be fixed, and the hollow markers should be displayed as expected.
