## Strategy for fixing the bug:
The issue stems from the incorrect handling of the `_fillstyle` attribute within the `_recache` method of the `MarkerStyle` class. The expected behavior is to set the `filled` attribute to `False` when `fillstyle` is set to `'none'`. To fix the bug, we need to update the logic in the `_recache` method to correctly handle the `fillstyle` attribute and adjust the `filled` attribute accordingly.

## Corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: lib/matplotlib/markers.py

# The declaration of the class containing the corrected function
class MarkerStyle: 
    # Corrected version of the buggy function
    def _recache(self):
        if self._marker_function is None:
            return
        self._path = _empty_path
        self._transform = IdentityTransform()
        self._alt_path = None
        self._alt_transform = None
        self._snap_threshold = None
        self._joinstyle = 'round'
        self._capstyle = 'butt'
        self._filled = True
        
        if self._fillstyle == 'none':
            self._filled = False
        
        self._marker_function()
```

This correction ensures that if the `fillstyle` is set to `'none'`, the `filled` attribute is correctly updated to `False`, allowing markers to be hollow as intended. This fix addresses the issue reported in the GitHub thread and aligns the behavior of the `MarkerStyle` class with the expected output values in the failing test cases.
