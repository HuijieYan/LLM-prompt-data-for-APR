### Analysis:
1. The `MarkerStyle` class contains the `_recache` method, which initializes various attributes to default values but calls the `_marker_function` method without any check or condition.
2. The bug seems to be related to the incorrect setting of the `_filled` attribute, which should be set to `False` when `fillstyle='none'`.
3. The GitHub issue indicates that setting `fillstyle='none'` should render the markers hollow, but the current implementation does not achieve this behavior.
4. To fix the bug, we need to update the `_filled` attribute based on the `fillstyle` parameter.

### Bug Fix:
```python
from .transforms import IdentityTransform, Affine2D

class MarkerStyle():
    def _recache(self):
        if self._marker_function is None:
            return
        self._path = _empty_path
        self._transform = IdentityTransform()
        self._alt_path = None
        self._alt_transform = None
        self._snap_threshold = None
        self._joinstyle = 'round'
        self._capstyle = 'butt'
        self._filled = (self._fillstyle != 'none')  # Set _filled based on fillstyle
        self._marker_function()
```

With this fix, the `_filled` attribute will be set to `False` when `fillstyle='none'`, ensuring that markers are rendered as hollow as intended by the user in the GitHub issue.
