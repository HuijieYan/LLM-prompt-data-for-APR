To fix the bug in the `_recache` function, we need to update the way the `_filled` attribute is set based on the value of `_fillstyle`. If `_fillstyle` is set to `'none'`, then `_filled` should be set to `False` to make the marker hollow.

Below is the corrected version of the `_recache` function:

```python
class MarkerStyle():

    def _recache(self):
        if self._marker_function is None:
            return
        
        self._path = _empty_path
        self._transform = IdentityTransform()
        self._alt_path = None
        self._alt_transform = None
        self._snap_threshold = None
        self._joinstyle = 'round'
        self._capstyle = 'butt'

        # Update _filled based on fillstyle
        if self._fillstyle == 'none':
            self._filled = False
        else:
            self._filled = True

        self._marker_function()
```

By checking the value of `_fillstyle` and setting `_filled` accordingly, the corrected function ensures that the marker is empty (hollow) when the `fillstyle` is set to `'none'`.

This fix addresses the GitHub issue where markers were not hollow when using `ax.scatter()` and setting `markers.MarkerStyle()`'s `fillstyle` to `'none'`. Now, the markers will display correctly as expected.
