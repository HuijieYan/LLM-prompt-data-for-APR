After analyzing the buggy function and the provided information, the bug seems to be related to setting the `_filled` attribute to `True` unconditionally, even if the `fillstyle` parameter is set to `'none'`. This inconsistency leads to markers not being hollow as expected.

To fix this bug, we need to adjust the logic that determines the `_filled` attribute based on the value of the `fillstyle` parameter. If `fillstyle` is set to `'none'`, then `_filled` should be set to `False`.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
class MarkerStyle():


    def _recache(self):
        if self._marker_function is None:
            return
        self._path = _empty_path
        self._transform = IdentityTransform()
        self._alt_path = None
        self._alt_transform = None
        self._snap_threshold = None
        self._joinstyle = 'round'
        self._capstyle = 'butt'
        
        # Adjusting _filled attribute based on fillstyle
        if self._fillstyle == 'none':
            self._filled = False
        else:
            self._filled = True
        
        self._marker_function()
```

By updating the `_filled` attribute based on the value of `fillstyle`, the corrected function should now correctly handle cases where markers should be hollow. This fix aligns with the expected input/output values and resolves the issue posted on GitHub.
