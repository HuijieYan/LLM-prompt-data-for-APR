### Analysis:
1. The `MarkerStyle` class contains a `_recache` method that initializes various attributes of the class instance. In the buggy function, if `_marker_function` is not `None`, it calls `_marker_function()` without checking if it's defined.
2. The bug causes the markers to not appear hollow when `fillstyle='none'` is used. This is due to `_filled` being set to `True` unconditionally in the `_recache` method.
3. The expected behavior is for the markers to be hollow when `fillstyle='none'` is set. This bug relates to the issue on GitHub where the user expects hollow markers but doesn't see them.
4. To fix the bug, we need to update the `_filled` attribute based on the `fillstyle` parameter when `_marker_function` is called. If `fillstyle` is set to `'none'`, `_filled` should be set to `False`.
5. I will provide a corrected version of the `_recache` method with the fix applied.

### Corrected version:
```python
class MarkerStyle():
    def _recache(self):
        if self._marker_function is None:
            return
        
        self._path = _empty_path
        self._transform = IdentityTransform()
        self._alt_path = None
        self._alt_transform = None
        self._snap_threshold = None
        self._joinstyle = 'round'
        self._capstyle = 'butt'
        
        # Check fillstyle to determine if marker should be filled
        if getattr(self, '_fillstyle', 'full') == 'none':
            self._filled = False
        else:
            self._filled = True
            
        self._marker_function()
```

By incorporating the check for the `fillstyle` parameter and setting `_filled` based on its value, the corrected version ensures that markers will appear hollow when `fillstyle='none'` is used, addressing the issue reported on GitHub.
