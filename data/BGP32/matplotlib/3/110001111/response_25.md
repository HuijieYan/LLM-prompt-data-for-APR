## Analysis
1. The `MarkerStyle` class contains a `_recache` function that is supposed to recache certain attributes. However, in the current implementation, the `_marker_function` is called without any indication of what this function does.
2. The bug seems to be related to the fact that `_marker_function` is called without proper initialization or definition, leading to unexpected behavior when setting `fillstyle='none'` in the `MarkerStyle` class.
3. The issue on GitHub confirms that the markers are not hollow when setting `fillstyle='none'`, indicating a problem with the marker style configuration.
4. To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the `_marker_function` is properly defined or updated to handle the desired marker configurations.

## Bug Fix
Here is the corrected version of the `_recache` function within the `MarkerStyle` class:

```python
class MarkerStyle():
    def _recache(self):
        if self._marker_function is None:
            return
        self._path = _empty_path
        self._transform = IdentityTransform()
        self._alt_path = None
        self._alt_transform = None
        self._snap_threshold = None
        self._joinstyle = 'round'
        self._capstyle = 'butt'
        self._filled = False  # Update filled to False to make markers hollow
        if self._fillstyle == 'none':
            self._filled = False
        else:
            self._filled = True
        self._marker_function()
```

By updating the `_recache` function to properly handle the `fillstyle` parameter and setting `_filled` accordingly, we ensure that markers can be made hollow when desired.
