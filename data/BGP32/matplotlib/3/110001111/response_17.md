To fix the bug in the `_recache` function, we need to update the `_filled` attribute based on the value of `_fillstyle`. If `_fillstyle` is set to `'none'`, then `_filled` should be set to `False`, indicating that the marker should be hollow. Here are the steps to resolve the issue:

1. Analyze the relationship between the `_recache` function and the `MarkerStyle` class, and the expected behavior of setting `fillstyle` to `'none'`.
2. Identify the location where the `_filled` attribute is being set incorrectly in the `_recache` function.
3. Determine that when `fillstyle` is set to `'none'`, `_filled` should be set to `False`.
4. Update the function to correctly set `_filled` based on the value of `fillstyle`.
5. Provide a corrected version of the `_recache` function below.

```python
class MarkerStyle():
    def _recache(self):
        if self._marker_function is None:
            return
        self._path = _empty_path
        self._transform = IdentityTransform()
        self._alt_path = None
        self._alt_transform = None
        self._snap_threshold = None
        self._joinstyle = 'round'
        self._capstyle = 'butt'
        
        if self._fillstyle is not None and self._fillstyle == 'none':
            self._filled = False
        else:
            self._filled = True
        
        self._marker_function()
```

With this correction, when the `fillstyle` parameter is set to `'none'`, the markers will be hollow as expected, resolving the issue mentioned on GitHub.
