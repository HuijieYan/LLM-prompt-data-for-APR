### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_recache` in the `MarkerStyle` class is supposed to re-initialize certain attributes. However, the issue lies in the assignment of `_filled` attribute which is hard-coded to `True`, irrespective of the actual `fillstyle`.
2. The expected behavior is for the `_filled` attribute to be set based on the `fillstyle`.
3. The failing test case demonstrates that the `_filled` attribute is not being set correctly, causing markers not to be hollow when the `fillstyle` is set to `'none'`.
4. To fix the bug, we need to update the assignment of the `_filled` attribute based on the `fillstyle`.

### Bug Fix:
```python
class MarkerStyle():
    def _recache(self):
        if self._marker_function is None:
            return
        self._path = _empty_path
        self._transform = IdentityTransform()
        self._alt_path = None
        self._alt_transform = None
        self._snap_threshold = None
        self._joinstyle = 'round'
        self._capstyle = 'butt'
        # Update the _filled attribute based on fillstyle
        if self._fillstyle == 'none':
            self._filled = False
        else:
            self._filled = True
        self._marker_function()
```

By updating the `_filled` attribute based on the `fillstyle`, the markers will be correctly set as hollow or filled according to the specified `fillstyle`.

This fix addresses the reported issue on GitHub where markers were not hollow when `fillstyle` was set to `'none'`.
