Based on the provided information, the issue in the `MarkerStyle` class is related to the `fillstyle` parameter not functioning as expected when set to `'none'`. The expected behavior is to have hollow markers, but the current implementation does not handle this correctly.

### Error Location:
The buggy function `_recache` in the `MarkerStyle` class sets `_filled` to `True` unconditionally, which contradicts the expected behavior when `fillstyle` is set to `'none'`.

### Cause of the Bug:
The bug arises from the fact that `_filled` is always set to `True`, regardless of the specified `fillstyle`, resulting in filled markers instead of hollow ones.

### Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, the `_filled` attribute should be based on the `fillstyle` parameter. When `fillstyle` is set to `'none'`, `_filled` should be set to `False` to create hollow markers.

### Corrected Version:
Here is the corrected version of the `_recache` function in the `MarkerStyle` class:
```python
    def _recache(self):
        if self._marker_function is None:
            return
        self._path = _empty_path
        self._transform = IdentityTransform()
        self._alt_path = None
        self._alt_transform = None
        self._snap_threshold = None
        self._joinstyle = 'round'
        self._capstyle = 'butt'
        self._filled = True if self.get_fillstyle() != 'none' else False
        self._marker_function()
```

By checking the `fillstyle` before setting `_filled`, the corrected version ensures that when `fillstyle='none'`, `_filled` is set to `False`, allowing for the creation of hollow markers as expected.

This correction should address the issue described in the GitHub problem where setting `fillstyle='none'` results in filled markers when using `ax.scatter()`.
