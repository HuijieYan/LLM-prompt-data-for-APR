### Analysis
The buggy function `_recache` within the `MarkerStyle` class is failing to correctly set the `_filled` value based on the `fillstyle` parameter. This results in markers not being hollow when `fillstyle` is set to `'none'`.

### Error Location
The error lies in the assignment of `self._filled = True` unconditionally within the `_recache` function. This causes markers to always be filled regardless of the `fillstyle` parameter.

### Cause of the Bug
The bug is caused by the incorrect handling of the `fillstyle` parameter within the `_recache` function. By always setting `_filled` to `True`, markers are always filled regardless of the intended `fillstyle` parameter.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug
To fix the bug, we need to adjust the assignment of `_filled` based on the `fillstyle` parameter. If `fillstyle` is `'none'`, then `_filled` should be set to `False` to render hollow markers.

### Corrected Version of the Function
```python
# The corrected version of the _recache function
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'

    # Update _filled based on fillstyle
    if self._fillstyle == 'none':
        self._filled = False
    else:
        self._filled = True

    self._marker_function()
```

With this corrected version, the `_filled` attribute will be set based on the `fillstyle` parameter, resolving the issue of markers not being hollow when `fillstyle` is set to `'none'`.
