The bug in the `_recache` function is that it calls a non-existent `_marker_function` without checking if it is initialized or not. This can lead to unexpected behavior, as seen in the GitHub issue where markers are not hollow when the `fillstyle` is set to 'none'.

To fix this bug, we need to add a check to ensure that `_marker_function` is not `None` before calling it. If it is `None`, the function should return without performing any further actions.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
# The corrected version of the buggy function
class MarkerStyle():
    def _recache(self):
        if self._marker_function is None:
            return
        self._path = _empty_path
        self._transform = IdentityTransform()
        self._alt_path = None
        self._alt_transform = None
        self._snap_threshold = None
        self._joinstyle = 'round'
        self._capstyle = 'butt'
        self._filled = True
        self._marker_function()
``` 

By adding the check for `_marker_function` before calling it, we ensure that the function behaves as expected and does not cause any unexpected behavior such as markers not being hollow when `fillstyle` is set to 'none'.
