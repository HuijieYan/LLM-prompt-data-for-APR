### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_recache` within the `MarkerStyle` class is responsible for setting various attributes related to the marker style.
2. The failing test is related to the `is_filled` method which checks if the marker is filled or not based on the `_filled` attribute.
3. The bug is causing the `is_filled` method to return `True` even when the expected result should be `False`, leading to the assertion error.
4. The cause of the bug is that the `_filled` attribute is always set to `True` in the `_recache` function regardless of the `fillstyle` parameter.
5. To fix the bug, the `_filled` attribute should be updated based on the `fillstyle` parameter provided.

### Fix Strategy:
1. Add a condition to check the `fillstyle` parameter within the `_recache` function.
2. If the `fillstyle` is set to `'none'`, then set the `_filled` attribute to `False` to indicate that the marker should not be filled.

### Corrected Version:
```python
class MarkerStyle():

    def _recache(self):
        if self._marker_function is None:
            return
        self._path = _empty_path
        self._transform = IdentityTransform()
        self._alt_path = None
        self._alt_transform = None
        self._snap_threshold = None
        self._joinstyle = 'round'
        self._capstyle = 'butt'
        if self.fillstyle == 'none':
            self._filled = False
        else:
            self._filled = True
        self._marker_function()
```

By updating the `_recache` function as shown above, the bug related to the fillstyle parameter not being reflected in the `_filled` attribute should be fixed. This correction should resolve the failing test and address the issue reported on GitHub.
