### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_recache` within the `MarkerStyle` class is responsible for setting various attributes of the `MarkerStyle` object.
2. The failing test is checking if the marker style is filled or not by using the `is_filled` method, which seems to be incorrect based on the error message.
3. The error message indicates that the `is_filled` method is returning `True` unexpectedly.
4. The bug seems to be related to the incorrect implementation of the `is_filled` method or the initialization of the `filled` attribute within the `_recache` function.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is caused by the `is_filled` method incorrectly returning `True` even when the fill style is set to 'none' in the `MarkerStyle` object. This results in the failing test assertion.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to update the `is_filled` method in the `MarkerStyle` class to correctly reflect the fill style set in the object. Additionally, ensure that the `filled` attribute is properly updated based on the fill style in the `_recache` function.

### Corrected Version:

```python
class MarkerStyle():
    
    def __init__(self, **kwargs):
        self._fillstyle = kwargs.get('fillstyle', 'full')
        # Add other initialization code as needed
    
    def get_fillstyle(self):
        return self._fillstyle

    def is_filled(self):
        return self._fillstyle != 'none'

    def _recache(self):
        if self._marker_function is None:
            return
        self._path = _empty_path
        self._transform = IdentityTransform()
        self._alt_path = None
        self._alt_transform = None
        self._snap_threshold = None
        self._joinstyle = 'round'
        self._capstyle = 'butt'
        self._filled = self.is_filled()
        self._marker_function()
```

With the corrected version above, the `is_filled` method correctly checks if the fill style is set to 'none' or not, and the `filled` attribute is updated accordingly in the `_recache` function. This should resolve the issue and pass the failing test related to fill style.
