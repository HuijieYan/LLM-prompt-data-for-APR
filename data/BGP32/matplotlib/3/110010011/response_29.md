## Analysis:
1. The `MarkerStyle` class contains a function `_recache` which is responsible for setting certain attributes to default values. The issue occurs when `self._marker_function` is not `None`, causing unexpected behavior in the `is_filled()` method of `MarkerStyle`.
2. The error message indicates that the `MarkerStyle` object is being treated as a method (`is_filled()`), resulting in the assertion failure.
3. The cause of the bug is that when `self._marker_function` is not `None`, the `_recache` function tries to call `self._marker_function()` which is not defined, leading to an incorrect state and behavior within the `MarkerStyle` object.
4. To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the `self._marker_function` attribute is handled properly and only called if it is a valid function.
5. The corrected version of the `_recache` function is provided below:

## Corrected Version:
```python
class MarkerStyle():

    def _recache(self):
        if self._marker_function is not None and callable(self._marker_function):
            self._marker_function()
        else:
            self._marker = None
        self._path = _empty_path
        self._transform = IdentityTransform()
        self._alt_path = None
        self._alt_transform = None
        self._snap_threshold = None
        self._joinstyle = 'round'
        self._capstyle = 'butt'
        self._filled = True

    # Additional method to check if marker is filled
    def is_filled(self):
        return self._filled
```

By adding a check for the existence and callability of `self._marker_function`, the corrected `_recache` function ensures that the `_marker_function` is only called when it is a valid function. This modification addresses the issue where incorrect behavior was observed due to the improper handling of `_marker_function`.
