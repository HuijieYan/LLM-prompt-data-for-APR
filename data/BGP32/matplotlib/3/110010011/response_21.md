### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_recache` in the `MarkerStyle` class is supposed to reset various attributes when called. However, there is a bug where the `_marker_function()` is being incorrectly called without passing any arguments.
2. The error message indicates that the `is_filled()` method is returning `True` when it should be returning `False`.
3. The issue reported in GitHub suggests that the `fillstyle='none'` parameter is not causing markers to be hollow as expected.
4. To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the `is_filled()` method correctly reflects the fillstyle being 'none' when set in the marker style.
5. The corrected version of the function should address the bug by properly handling the fillstyle attribute check.

### Correction:
```python
class MarkerStyle():
    def _recache(self):
        if self._marker_function is None:
            return
        self._path = _empty_path
        self._transform = IdentityTransform()
        self._alt_path = None
        self._alt_transform = None
        self._snap_threshold = None
        self._joinstyle = 'round'
        self._capstyle = 'butt'
        self._filled = self.get_fillstyle() != 'none'
        self._marker_function(self)

    def is_filled(self):  # Added method to determine fill status
        return self._filled

    def get_fillstyle(self):
        return self.get_path().get_fillstyle()
```

In the corrected code:
- The `is_filled` method now checks the actual fill status based on the fill style attribute.
- The `get_fillstyle` method retrieves the fillstyle.
- The `self._filled` attribute is set based on the actual fill style being 'none'.
- The `_marker_function` is called with the `self` instance as an argument to handle any necessary operations based on the marker style.

With these changes, the bug should be fixed, and the marker style should correctly reflect the 'none' fillstyle when checked.
