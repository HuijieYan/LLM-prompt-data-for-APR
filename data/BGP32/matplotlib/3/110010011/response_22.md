### Analysis:
1. The `_recache` function in the `MarkerStyle` class sets various attributes to default values and then calls the `_marker_function` if it is not `None`.
2. The failing test is for the `is_filled` method of `MarkerStyle`, which returns `True` by default. This indicates that even when `fillstyle='none'` is set, the markers are not being displayed as hollow.
3. The GitHub issue suggests that setting `fillstyle='none'` should render the markers hollow, but it is not working as expected.
4. The issue seems to be related to how the `fillstyle` is handled in the implementation of the markers.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is likely caused by not properly handling the `fillstyle` parameter when rendering markers. In the original implementation, setting `fillstyle='none'` does not actually render the markers as hollow as expected, leading to the failing test and the issue on GitHub.

### Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to modify the implementation of the `MarkerStyle` class to correctly handle the `fillstyle` parameter when rendering markers. Specifically, when `fillstyle='none'` is set, the markers should be displayed as hollow.

### Corrected Version:
```python
class MarkerStyle():
    def _recache(self):
        if self._marker_function is None:
            return
        self._path = _empty_path
        self._transform = IdentityTransform()
        self._alt_path = None
        self._alt_transform = None
        self._snap_threshold = None
        self._joinstyle = 'round'
        self._capstyle = 'butt'
        self._filled = True
        if self.get_fillstyle() == 'none':  # Check if fillstyle is 'none'
            self._filled = False
        self._marker_function()
```

By adding a check for `fillstyle='none'` in the `_recache` function and setting `_filled` accordingly, we ensure that markers are displayed as hollow when the `fillstyle` is set to 'none'. This fix addresses the bug reported in the failing test and the GitHub issue, rendering the markers as expected when using the markers in the provided example.
