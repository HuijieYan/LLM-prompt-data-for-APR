## Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_recache` in the `MarkerStyle` class is supposed to handle some initialization tasks related to markers, but the current implementation is causing the marker to be filled even when `fillstyle` is set to `'none'`.
2. The failing test `test_marker_fillstyle` is checking if the marker is filled or not, indicating that the current implementation is not setting `fillstyle` correctly.
3. The GitHub issue confirms that setting `fillstyle='none'` is not resulting in hollow markers as expected.
4. The cause of the bug is that the `_recache` function is not correctly handling the fillstyle attribute, leading to markers being filled regardless of the specified `fillstyle`.
5. To fix the bug, the `_recache` function should be modified to correctly handle the `fillstyle` parameter and ensure that the markers are displayed as hollow when `fillstyle='none'`.

## Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to adjust the `_recache` function to correctly handle the `fillstyle` parameter and set the `self._filled` attribute accordingly.

Here is the corrected version of the `_recache` function:

```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    self._filled = self.get_fillstyle() != 'none'
    self._marker_function()
```

With this modification, the `self._filled` attribute will be set based on the `fillstyle` parameter, ensuring that markers are displayed correctly as either filled or hollow. This fix should resolve the issue reported on GitHub and make the failing test pass.
