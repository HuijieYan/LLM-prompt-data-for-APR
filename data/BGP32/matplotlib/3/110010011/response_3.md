### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_recache` in the `MarkerStyle` class is responsible for setting default values to different attributes. However, there is a bug in the function where it calls `self._marker_function()` unconditionally, which raises the error as shown in the failing test.
2. The failing test indicates that the `is_filled()` method is returning `True` when it should be returning `False`.
3. The bug is causing the markers to be filled when they are expected to be hollow, as reported in the GitHub issue.
4. To fix the bug, we need to make sure that the `self._filled` attribute in the `MarkerStyle` class is set correctly based on the `fillstyle` parameter passed during initialization.
5. Additionally, we need to update the `_recache` function to set the `self._filled` attribute based on the `fillstyle`.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Update the `MarkerStyle` class to store the `fillstyle` parameter during initialization and use it to determine if the marker should be filled or not.
2. Modify the `_recache` function to set the `self._filled` attribute based on the `fillstyle` parameter.
3. Check and correct the condition inside the `is_filled()` method to return the correct filled status based on the `fillstyle`.

### Updated Corrected Version:
```python
class MarkerStyle():
    def __init__(self, marker=None, fillstyle=None):
        self._marker_function = None
        self.fillstyle = fillstyle
        self.set_fill_style()

    def set_fill_style(self):
        if self.fillstyle == 'none':
            self._filled = False
        else:
            self._filled = True

    def _recache(self):
        if self._marker_function is None:
            return
        self._path = _empty_path
        self._transform = IdentityTransform()
        self._alt_path = None
        self._alt_transform = None
        self._snap_threshold = None
        self._joinstyle = 'round'
        self._capstyle = 'butt'
        self.set_fill_style()
        if self._filled:
            self._marker_function()

    def is_filled(self):
        return self._filled
```

By updating the `MarkerStyle` class as shown above, the bug causing markers to be filled incorrectly will be resolved. This corrected version should pass the failing test and address the issue reported on GitHub.
