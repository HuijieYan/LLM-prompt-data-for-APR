### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_recache` in the `MarkerStyle` class is responsible for resetting certain attributes related to marker style.
2. The failing test is related to the `is_filled` method which returns `True` instead of the expected result.
3. The bug causes markers to not appear as hollow even when `fillstyle` is set to 'none' due to the incorrect implementation in `_recache`.
4. To fix the bug, we need to update the logic within the `_recache` function to correctly handle the `filled` attribute based on the `fillstyle`.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Update the `_recache` function to correctly set the `filled` attribute based on the `fillstyle`.
2. If the `fillstyle` is set to 'none', the `filled` attribute should be set to `False`.
3. Ensure that the condition for setting `filled` is implemented correctly.
4. Test the corrected function with the failing test to confirm the fix.

### Corrected Version:
```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: lib/matplotlib/markers.py

# The corrected version of the class with the fixed function
class MarkerStyle():
    def _recache(self):
        if self._marker_function is None:
            return
        self._path = _empty_path
        self._transform = IdentityTransform()
        self._alt_path = None
        self._alt_transform = None
        self._snap_threshold = None
        self._joinstyle = 'round'
        self._capstyle = 'butt'
        
        if self._fillstyle == 'none':  # Check fillstyle for correct filled attribute
            self._filled = False
        else:
            self._filled = True
            
        self._marker_function()
```

By updating the `_recache` function to correctly set the `filled` attribute based on the `fillstyle`, the bug should be fixed. The corrected version should now pass the failing test and address the issue reported on GitHub.
