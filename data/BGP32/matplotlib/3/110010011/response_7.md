### Analyzing the buggy function

The buggy function `_recache` in the `MarkerStyle` class is causing the issue where markers are not displayed as hollow when the `fillstyle` is set to 'none'. The failing test is related to the `is_filled` method which should return False when the marker is not filled.

### Potential error locations

The issue seems to be with the `_recache` function in the `MarkerStyle` class. Specifically, setting `self._filled = True` unconditionally might be causing the marker to be filled even when `fillstyle` is set to 'none'.

### Cause of the bug

The bug is caused by the `_recache` function always setting `_filled` to `True`, regardless of the `fillstyle`. This causes the marker to be filled even when it should be hollow. As a result, the test for `marker_style.is_filled()` returns `True` instead of `False`.

### Strategy for fixing the bug

To fix this bug, we need to update the `_recache` function in the `MarkerStyle` class to correctly handle the `fillstyle='none'` case. We should set `_filled` to `False` when `fillstyle` is 'none' to ensure that the marker is hollow when desired.

### Corrected version of the function

```python
class MarkerStyle():

    def _recache(self):
        if self._marker_function is None:
            return
        self._path = _empty_path
        self._transform = IdentityTransform()
        self._alt_path = None
        self._alt_transform = None
        self._snap_threshold = None
        self._joinstyle = 'round'
        self._capstyle = 'butt'
        self._filled = self._fillstyle != 'none'  # Update filled status based on fillstyle
        self._marker_function()
```

By updating the `_recache` function to consider the `fillstyle` when setting the `_filled` attribute, we ensure that the marker is displayed as hollow when `fillstyle='none'`. This correction should resolve the issue reported in the GitHub discussion and make the test pass successfully.
