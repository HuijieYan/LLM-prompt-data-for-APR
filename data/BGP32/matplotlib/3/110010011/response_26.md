### Analysis:
1. The `MarkerStyle` class has a buggy function `_recache` which is responsible for setting certain attributes when a marker function is not None.
2. The failing test is related to the `is_filled` method which is checking if the marker is filled or not.
3. The error message indicates that the `is_filled` method does not return the expected result.
4. The cause of the bug lies in the fact that the `_recache` method is not properly handling the case where `self._marker_function` is not None.
5. The GitHub issue suggests that setting `fillstyle='none'` should result in hollow markers when using `ax.scatter()`, which is not happening.

### Fix Strategy:
1. Update the `_recache` method to properly handle the case where `self._marker_function` is not None.
2. Ensure that setting `fillstyle='none'` actually results in hollow markers when using `ax.scatter()`.

### Corrected Version:
```python
class MarkerStyle():
    def _recache(self):
        if self._marker_function is None:
            return
        self._path = _empty_path
        self._transform = IdentityTransform()
        self._alt_path = None
        self._alt_transform = None
        self._snap_threshold = None
        self._joinstyle = 'round'
        self._capstyle = 'butt'
        self._filled = False  # Set filled to False for hollow markers
        self._marker_function()
``` 

By updating the `_recache` method to set `_filled = False` when `self._marker_function` is not None, the corrected version should now properly handle creating hollow markers when setting `fillstyle='none'`.
