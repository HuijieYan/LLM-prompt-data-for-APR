## Analysis
The buggy function `_recache()` in the `MarkerStyle` class is supposed to recache the marker style attributes. However, the issue arises when calling the `_marker_function()` without checking if it is not None. This can lead to unexpected behavior and cause the markers not to be hollow when `fillstyle='none'` is set.

The failing test message indicates that the `is_filled()` method is returning `True` when it shouldn't due to the incorrect recaching of the marker style attributes.

The GitHub issue highlights a similar problem where setting `fillstyle='none'` does not produce hollow markers as expected.

## Bug Cause
The bug is caused by calling the `_marker_function()` without checking if it is not None within the `_recache()` method. This results in incorrect marker style attributes being set, leading to markers not being hollow when expected.

## Strategy for Fixing the Bug
To fix the bug:
1. Ensure that the `_marker_function` is not None before calling it within the `_recache()` method.
2. Update the `_filled` attribute based on the `fillstyle`, so that hollow markers can be correctly represented.

## Corrected Version
```python
class MarkerStyle():
    def _recache(self):
        if self._marker_function is None:
            return
        self._path = _empty_path
        self._transform = IdentityTransform()
        self._alt_path = None
        self._alt_transform = None
        self._snap_threshold = None
        self._joinstyle = 'round'
        self._capstyle = 'butt'
        self._filled = self.get_fillstyle() != 'none'  # Update _filled based on fillstyle
        if self._filled:
            self._marker_function()
```

In the corrected version:
- We check if `_marker_function` is not None before calling it to prevent unexpected behavior.
- We update the `_filled` attribute based on the `fillstyle` to ensure that hollow markers are represented correctly.

With these changes, the issue of markers not being hollow when `fillstyle='none'` should be resolved.
