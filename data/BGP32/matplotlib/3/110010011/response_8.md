### Analysis:
- The buggy function `_recache` in the `MarkerStyle` class is responsible for setting default values for various attributes within the class. The issue arises when the `_marker_function` is called without checking if it's `None` or not. This leads to incorrect behavior when `is_filled` method is called.
- The failing test indicates that the `is_filled` method is returning `True` unexpectedly, causing the assertion to fail.
- The GitHub issue also confirms the problem where setting `fillstyle='none'` doesn't render hollow markers as expected.

### Potential Error Location:
- The line causing the issue is `self._marker_function()`. This function is called without proper validation, causing incorrect behavior.

### Bug Cause:
- The bug occurs because the `_marker_function` is called directly without checking if it's `None`, leading to incorrect attribute settings and behavior.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
- To fix the bug, we should check if the `_marker_function` is not `None` before calling it in the `_recache` function.
- This will ensure that default values are correctly set and prevent unexpected behavior.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
class MarkerStyle():
    def _recache(self):
        if self._marker_function is None:
            return
        self._path = _empty_path
        self._transform = IdentityTransform()
        self._alt_path = None
        self._alt_transform = None
        self._snap_threshold = None
        self._joinstyle = 'round'
        self._capstyle = 'butt'
        self._filled = True
        if self._marker_function:
            self._marker_function()
```

By adding an additional check `if self._marker_function` before calling it, we ensure that the function is only executed if it's not `None`. This fix should resolve the incorrect behavior and pass the failing test successfully.
