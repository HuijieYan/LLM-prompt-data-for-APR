## Fixing the buggy function

### Issue Analysis
The issue stemmed from the implementation of the `_recache` function in the `MarkerStyle` class. The function was not correctly handling the `fillstyle` parameter, leading to incorrect marker fillstyle behavior when used with `'none'`.

### Error Location
The error lies in the way the `_filled` attribute is being set in the `_recache` function. Currently, it is set to `True` unconditionally, which is incorrect when the `fillstyle` is intended to be `'none'`.

### Cause of the Bug
The failing test with `fillstyle='none'` is not working as expected due to the `_filled` attribute being set to `True` regardless of the `fillstyle` parameter value. This contradiction leads to the incorrect behavior of the markers in the GitHub issue scenario.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug
To fix this bug, we need to adjust the logic in the `_recache` function to properly handle the `fillstyle` parameter.
- If `fillstyle` is set to `'none'`, then `_filled` should be set to `False`.
- If `fillstyle` is set to any other value, `_filled` should be set to `True`.

### Corrected Version of the `_recache` Function

```python
class MarkerStyle():

    def _recache(self):
        if self._marker_function is None:
            return
        self._path = _empty_path
        self._transform = IdentityTransform()
        self._alt_path = None
        self._alt_transform = None
        self._snap_threshold = None
        self._joinstyle = 'round'
        self._capstyle = 'butt'
        self._filled = self._fillstyle != 'none'
        self._marker_function()
```

By adjusting the assignment of the `_filled` attribute based on the `fillstyle` parameter value, the corrected version of the `_recache` function ensures that markers will behave as expected when `fillstyle='none'` is used.

This fix should address the bug reported in the GitHub issue and allow the failing test to pass successfully.
