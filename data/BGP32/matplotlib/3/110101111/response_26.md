## Identified Bug:
The bug in the `_recache` function of the `MarkerStyle` class is that it sets the `_filled` attribute to `True` unconditionally at the end of the function. This leads to filled markers even when the `fillstyle` is set to `'none'`.

## Bug Explanation:
In the failing test case, `test_marker_fillstyle`, the `MarkerStyle` object is initialized with `fillstyle='none'`, which should result in a hollow or unfilled marker. However, due to the bug in the `_recache` function, the `_filled` attribute is always set to `True` at the end, overriding the intended behavior.

## Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, the `_filled` attribute should be set based on the value of `fillstyle`. If `fillstyle` is `'none'`, then `_filled` should be set to `False`. This adjustment will ensure that markers are properly displayed as hollow when the `fillstyle` is set to `'none'.

## Corrected Version:
Here is the corrected version of the `_recache` function in the `MarkerStyle` class:

```python
class MarkerStyle():

    def _recache(self):
        if self._marker_function is None:
            return
        
        self._path = _empty_path
        self._transform = IdentityTransform()
        self._alt_path = None
        self._alt_transform = None
        self._snap_threshold = None
        self._joinstyle = 'round'
        self._capstyle = 'butt'
        
        if self.get_fillstyle() == 'none':
            self._filled = False
        else:
            self._filled = True
        
        self._marker_function()
```

With this correction, the `_filled` attribute will be set according to the specified `fillstyle`, ensuring that the markers are displayed correctly as either filled or hollow based on the provided configuration.
