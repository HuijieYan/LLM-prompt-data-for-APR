To fix the bug in the `_recache` function of the `MarkerStyle` class, we need to correctly set the `_filled` attribute based on the `fillstyle` parameter. The current implementation always sets `_filled` to `True` regardless of the `fillstyle` specified.

Here is the corrected version of the `_recache` function:

```python
class MarkerStyle():
    def _recache(self):
        if self._marker_function is None:
            return
        self._path = _empty_path
        self._transform = IdentityTransform()
        self._alt_path = None
        self._alt_transform = None
        self._snap_threshold = None
        self._joinstyle = 'round'
        self._capstyle = 'butt'
        
        # Check fillstyle to determine if marker should be filled
        if self._fillstyle in ['full', 'left', 'right']:
            self._filled = True
        else:
            self._filled = False
        
        self._marker_function()
```

By checking the `fillstyle` parameter and setting the `_filled` attribute accordingly, the corrected version of the function will ensure that markers can be specified as hollow when needed.

This fix addresses the issue reported on GitHub where markers were not appearing as hollow despite setting the `fillstyle` to `'none'`. By updating the `_filled` attribute based on the `fillstyle` parameter, the markers will behave as expected.
