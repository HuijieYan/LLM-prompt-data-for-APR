The bug in the `_recache` function is that despite setting the `_filled` attribute to `True` by default, the expected behavior requires it to be set to `False` when `fillstyle` is set to `'none'`. This discrepancy causes the markers to be filled instead of hollow as desired.

To fix this bug, we need to update the `_recache` function to consider the `fillstyle` parameter and adjust the `_filled` attribute accordingly.

Here is the corrected version of the `_recache` function:
```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    
    if self.get_fillstyle() == 'none':
        self._filled = False
    else:
        self._filled = True
        
    self._marker_function()
```

By adding the conditional check for `fillstyle == 'none'` and setting `_filled` accordingly, the corrected function will now behave as expected and pass the failing test. This fix will address the issue reported on GitHub regarding markers not being hollow when using `fillstyle='none'`.
