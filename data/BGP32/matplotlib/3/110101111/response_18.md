## Analysis
- The buggy function `_recache` in the `MarkerStyle` class sets certain properties to default values and calls the `_marker_function` method if it is not None.
- The failing test `test_marker_fillstyle` creates a `MarkerStyle` object with a marker 'o' and fillstyle 'none', and checks if the correct fillstyle is returned by the `get_fillstyle` method and if the marker is filled or not using the `is_filled` method.
- The variable `_filled` should be set to False when the fillstyle is 'none' to indicate that the marker should not be filled.

## Bug Explanation
- In the current implementation of the `_recache` function, regardless of the fillstyle provided, `_filled` is always set to `True`. This results in the markers being filled even when the fillstyle is explicitly set to 'none'.
- This causes the failing test to fail because it expects the marker not to be filled when the fillstyle is 'none'.

## Fix Strategy
- Modify the `_recache` function to set `_filled` based on the fillstyle provided. If the fillstyle is 'none', then set `_filled` to `False` to ensure that the marker is not filled.
- Ensure that `_filled` aligns with the specified fillstyle and that the test `test_marker_fillstyle` passes successfully.

## Corrected Version of the Buggy Function
```python
# The corrected version of the buggy function
class MarkerStyle():

    def _recache(self):
        if self._marker_function is None:
            return
        
        self._path = _empty_path
        self._transform = IdentityTransform()
        self._alt_path = None
        self._alt_transform = None
        self._snap_threshold = None
        self._joinstyle = 'round'
        self._capstyle = 'butt'
        
        if self._fillstyle == 'none':
            self._filled = False
        else:
            self._filled = True
        
        self._marker_function()
```

By updating the `_recache` function as shown above, the issue reported on GitHub will be resolved, and the failing test `test_marker_fillstyle` should pass successfully.
