To fix the bug in the `_recache` function of the `MarkerStyle` class, we need to address the incorrect assignment of `_filled` parameter. The function should correctly set `_filled` to `False` when the fillstyle is set to `'none'`.

Here is the corrected version of the `_recache` function:
```python
class MarkerStyle():
    def _recache(self):
        if self._marker_function is None:
            return
        self._path = _empty_path
        self._transform = IdentityTransform()
        self._alt_path = None
        self._alt_transform = None
        self._snap_threshold = None
        self._joinstyle = 'round'
        self._capstyle = 'butt'
        self._filled = self.get_fillstyle() != 'none'
        self._marker_function()
```

By updating the assignment of `_filled` based on the `fillstyle`, we ensure that the expected behavior is met for creating hollow markers. The corrected version should now pass the failing test for setting the fillstyle to `'none'`.

Additionally, the corrected version addresses the issue reported on GitHub where the markers were not appearing as hollow when using `ax.scatter()` with a custom `MarkerStyle` and setting `fillstyle='none'. The provided code for reproduction should now display hollow markers correctly.

Please integrate this corrected version into your codebase to resolve the bug and meet the expected input/output values.
