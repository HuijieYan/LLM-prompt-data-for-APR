To fix the bug in the `_recache` function, we need to ensure that the `self._filled` attribute is set correctly based on the `fillstyle` parameter provided in the `MarkerStyle` constructor. The current implementation always sets `_filled` to `True` regardless of the `fillstyle` value.

Here is the corrected version of the `_recache` function:

```python
class MarkerStyle():
    def _recache(self):
        if self._marker_function is None:
            return
        self._path = _empty_path
        self._transform = IdentityTransform()
        self._alt_path = None
        self._alt_transform = None
        self._snap_threshold = None
        self._joinstyle = 'round'
        self._capstyle = 'butt'
        # Update _filled based on fillstyle value
        if self._fillstyle == 'none':
            self._filled = False
        else:
            self._filled = True
        self._marker_function()
```

With this correction, the `_filled` attribute will be set correctly based on the provided `fillstyle` parameter. This change should ensure that the markers are hollow when the `fillstyle` is set to `'none'`, as expected in the failing test case.

By implementing this fix, the corrected version of the `_recache` function should resolve the issue reported on GitHub where markers were not hollow when using `ax.scatter()` with `fillstyle='none'`.

Once this correction is applied, running the failing test should now pass successfully.
