## Fixing the bug in the _recache function

### Bug Analysis:
The bug in the `_recache` function is that even when the `fillstyle` is set to `'none'`, the `_filled` attribute is always being set to `True`, which causes the markers not to be hollow when rendered. This discrepancy results in the failing test case related to checking if the marker is filled.

### Solution Strategy:
To fix the bug, the `_filled` attribute should be updated based on the `fillstyle` parameter. If the `fillstyle` is set to `'none'`, then `_filled` should be set to `False` to ensure that the marker is hollow.

### Updated _recache function:
Here is the corrected version of the `_recache` function:

```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    
    if self._fillstyle == 'none':
        self._filled = False
    else:
        self._filled = True
        
    self._marker_function()
```

With this fix, the `_filled` attribute will be correctly set based on the `fillstyle` parameter value, ensuring that markers are rendered as hollow when `fillstyle='none'`.

This corrected version of the `_recache` function will address the issue described in the GitHub post and pass the failing test case related to marker fillstyle.
