## Bug Explanation
The bug in the `_recache` function is that it sets the `_filled` attribute to `True` unconditionally, regardless of the specified `fillstyle` value. This results in the markers not being hollow as expected when `fillstyle='none'` is set. The failing test `test_marker_fillstyle` checks for this specific scenario where the fillstyle is set to 'none', but the marker is not actually hollow.

## Fixing the Bug
To fix the bug, we need to update the `_filled` attribute based on the `fillstyle` that is set. If `fillstyle` is 'none', then `_filled` should be set to `False` to ensure that the marker is hollow. We can modify the `_recache` function to address this issue.

## The corrected version of the buggy function
```python
class MarkerStyle():

    def _recache(self):
        if self._marker_function is None:
            return
        
        self._path = _empty_path
        self._transform = IdentityTransform()
        self._alt_path = None
        self._alt_transform = None
        self._snap_threshold = None
        self._joinstyle = 'round'
        self._capstyle = 'butt'
        
        if self._fillstyle == 'none':
            self._filled = False
        else:
            self._filled = True
        
        self._marker_function()
```

By updating the `_filled` attribute based on the `fillstyle` parameter, the corrected version of the `_recache` function ensures that markers will appear hollow when `fillstyle='none'` is set. This modification resolves the issue reported on GitHub and enables the marker style to be correctly applied.
