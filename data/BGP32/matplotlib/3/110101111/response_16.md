## Fixing the buggy function

### Issue Analysis
The issue arises from the behavior of the `_recache` function in the `MarkerStyle` class. The function sets the `_filled` attribute to `True` unconditionally, which goes against the expected behavior when `fillstyle` is set to `'none'`. This causes the markers to be filled even when the intention is to have hollow markers.

### Bug Cause
The bug is caused by the function `_recache` setting `_filled` to `True` regardless of the `fillstyle` value, resulting in filled markers instead of hollow markers.

### Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to update the `_recache` function to consider the value of `fillstyle` when setting the `_filled` attribute. If `fillstyle` is `'none'`, then `_filled` should be set to `False` to ensure that markers are hollow.

### Corrected Version
```python
class MarkerStyle():
    def _recache(self):
        if self._marker_function is None:
            return
        
        self._path = _empty_path
        self._transform = IdentityTransform()
        self._alt_path = None
        self._alt_transform = None
        self._snap_threshold = None
        self._joinstyle = 'round'
        self._capstyle = 'butt'
        self._filled = False if self._fillstyle == 'none' else True
        
        self._marker_function()
```

By updating the `_recache` function to consider the `fillstyle` attribute when setting `_filled`, the corrected version aligns with the expected behavior for markers with different fill styles. This fix ensures that markers will correctly appear as hollow when `fillstyle='none'` is specified.
