## Correction:

```python
class MarkerStyle():
    def _recache(self):
        if self._marker_function is None:
            return
        self._path = Path(np.array([[0.0, -1.0]]))
        self._transform = IdentityTransform()
        self._alt_path = None
        self._alt_transform = None
        self._snap_threshold = np.inf
        self._joinstyle = 'round'
        self._capstyle = 'butt'
        self._filled = False  # Corrected to set filled as False
        self._marker_function()
```

By correcting the `_recache` function to set `_filled` as `False`, the MarkerStyle will be considered as hollow when the `fillstyle='none'` is used. This correction ensures that the expected behavior for setting markers as hollow is achieved.

This correction will resolve the issue of markers not being hollow when using `ax.scatter()` and setting `fillstyle='none'` as reported in the GitHub issue.
