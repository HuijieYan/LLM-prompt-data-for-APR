Based on the provided information, the bug in the `_recache` function of the `MarkerStyle` class is that the `_marker_function` is called without any check or validation if it is actually set. This can result in unexpected behavior when the `_marker_function` is None.

### Error Location:
The main error in the `_recache` function is the direct call to `_marker_function` without checking if it is set.

### Cause of the Bug:
The bug is causing the `MarkerStyle` to not properly handle cases where `_marker_function` is None. This leads to unexpected behavior and failing test cases, such as the one testing `fillstyle`. 

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that `_marker_function` is checked before being called in the `_recache` function. If it is None, then it should not be invoked.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
class MarkerStyle():

    def _recache(self):
        if self._marker_function:
            self._path = _empty_path
            self._transform = IdentityTransform()
            self._alt_path = None
            self._alt_transform = None
            self._snap_threshold = None
            self._joinstyle = 'round'
            self._capstyle = 'butt'
            self._filled = True
            self._marker_function()
```

By making this change, the `_recache` function will now properly handle cases where `_marker_function` is None and prevent unexpected behavior, resolving the failing test case related to the `fillstyle`.
