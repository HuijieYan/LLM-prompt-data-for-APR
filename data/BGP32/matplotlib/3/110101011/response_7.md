### Analysis
The buggy function `_recache` in the `MarkerStyle` class fails to correctly update the attributes `_path`, `_snap_threshold`, `_joinstyle`, `_capstyle`, and `_filled` based on the conditions provided. This leads to incorrect behavior when trying to create hollow markers.

### Bug Explanation
The `_recache` function in the `MarkerStyle` class does not properly handle the case when `self._marker_function` is not `None`. This results in incorrect attribute assignments, as observed in the failing test where the fillstyle is set to `'none'` but the marker is still filled. The values passed to the attributes are not being updated properly, leading to the incorrect behavior.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the attributes are updated correctly based on the conditions provided in the `_recache` function. Specifically, when `self._marker_function` is not `None`, we should update the values of `_path`, `_snap_threshold`, `_joinstyle`, `_capstyle`, and `_filled` accordingly.

### Corrected Version of the Function
Here is the corrected version of the `_recache` function in the `MarkerStyle` class:

```python
class MarkerStyle():

    def _recache(self):
        if self._marker_function is not None:
            self._path = _empty_path
            self._transform = IdentityTransform()
            self._alt_path = None
            self._alt_transform = None
            self._snap_threshold = np.inf
            self._joinstyle = 'round'
            self._capstyle = 'butt'
            self._filled = False
            self._marker_function()
```

By updating the attributes properly based on the condition, the corrected version of the function should now handle cases where the fillstyle is set to `'none'` and correctly create hollow markers.
