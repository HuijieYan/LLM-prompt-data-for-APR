### Analysis:
1. The `MarkerStyle` class contains a `_recache` method that is responsible for re-calculating the marker properties. The bug seems to be related to the incorrect handling of the `marker_function` when setting `fillstyle='none'`.
2. The `_recache` method resets several properties of the `MarkerStyle` instance including `_path, _transform, _snap_threshold, _joinstyle, _capstyle, _filled`, and finally calls `_marker_function` which is not set in the provided code.
3. The failing test `test_marker_fillstyle` tries to create a `MarkerStyle` instance with `fillstyle='none'` and expects the `get_fillstyle` method to return `'none'` and `is_filled` method to return `False`. However, the bug causes unexpected behavior.
4. **Bug Cause:** The `_recache` method doesn't handle the `fillstyle='none'` case correctly, which results in the marker not being hollow as expected.
5. **Bug Fix Strategy:** Modify the `_recache` method to handle the `fillstyle='none'` case properly, ensuring that the marker is rendered as hollow when specified.

### Corrected Version:
```python
class MarkerStyle():
    def _recache(self):
        if self._marker_function is None:
            return
        self._path = _empty_path
        self._transform = IdentityTransform()
        self._alt_path = None
        self._alt_transform = None
        self._snap_threshold = None
        self._joinstyle = 'round'
        self._capstyle = 'butt'
        if self.get_fillstyle() == 'none':  # Check if fillstyle is set to 'none'
            self._filled = False
        self._marker_function()
```

With this corrected version, the `_recache` method now correctly checks if the `fillstyle` is set to `'none'` and updates the `_filled` property accordingly to render the marker as hollow when required. This change should resolve the issue described on GitHub and make the failing test `test_marker_fillstyle` pass successfully.
