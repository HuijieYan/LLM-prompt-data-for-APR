## Bug Explanation
The bug in the `_recache` function of the `MarkerStyle` class is that it is calling the `_marker_function` without checking if it is actually defined. This can lead to a `NoneType` object error if `_marker_function` is not set during initialization.

## Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, first, check if `_marker_function` is not None before calling it. If it is None, return from the function without performing any operations. This will prevent any potential errors related to the `_marker_function` being undefined.

## The corrected version of the function
```python
class MarkerStyle():
    def _recache(self):
        if self._marker_function is None:
            return
        self._path = _empty_path
        self._transform = IdentityTransform()
        self._alt_path = None
        self._alt_transform = None
        self._snap_threshold = None
        self._joinstyle = 'round'
        self._capstyle = 'butt'
        self._filled = True
        self._marker_function()
``` 

With this corrected version, the `_recache` function will only call the `_marker_function` if it is defined, avoiding any potential errors related to a `NoneType` object.
