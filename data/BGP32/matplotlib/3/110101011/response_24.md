To fix the bug in the `_recache` function of the `MarkerStyle` class, we need to ensure that when `marker_function` is called, the correct marker path is generated based on the provided marker style, including the specified fillstyle.

The issue reported on GitHub indicates that setting `fillstyle='none'` should result in hollow markers, but the current implementation does not handle this correctly.

Here's a corrected version of the `_recache` function:

```python
class MarkerStyle:

    def _recache(self):
        if self._marker_function is None:
            return
        
        marker_path, fillstyle = self._marker_function()
        
        if fillstyle == 'none':
            self._filled = False
        
        self._path = marker_path
        self._transform = IdentityTransform()
        self._alt_path = None
        self._alt_transform = None
        self._snap_threshold = None
        self._joinstyle = 'round'
        self._capstyle = 'butt'
```

In this corrected version, the `_marker_function` is modified to return both the marker path and the fill style. If the fill style is set to `'none'`, the `filled` attribute is updated to `False`, ensuring that the markers are drawn as hollow when the `fillstyle` is specified as 'none'.

This correction should resolve the issue reported on GitHub and allow the markers to be displayed as hollow when using `ax.scatter()` with the specified fillstyle.
