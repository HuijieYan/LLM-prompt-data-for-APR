### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_recache` in the `MarkerStyle` class resets various attributes to default values and then calls `_marker_function`, assuming it is assigned. However, the issue lies in the fact that it doesn't correctly handle the case when `self._marker_function` is `None`.
2. The failing test `test_marker_fillstyle` asserts the fillstyle of a custom `MarkerStyle` object with `fillstyle='none'`.
3. Based on the runtime values provided, the `_recache` function resets several attributes to default values, but the issue arises when it tries to call `self._marker_function`, which may lead to errors such as `AttributeError` if `_marker_function` is not assigned.
4. To fix the bug, we need to check if `self._marker_function` is not `None` before calling it.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is caused by the assumption that `_marker_function` is always assigned before calling it in the `_recache` function, leading to a potential `AttributeError` when it is not assigned.

### Fixing the Bug:
We can fix the bug by adding a check to ensure that `self._marker_function` is not `None` before calling it. If it is not assigned, the function should return without attempting the call.

### Corrected Version:
```python
class MarkerStyle():
    def _recache(self):
        if self._marker_function is None:
            return
        self._path = _empty_path
        self._transform = IdentityTransform()
        self._alt_path = None
        self._alt_transform = None
        self._snap_threshold = None
        self._joinstyle = 'round'
        self._capstyle = 'butt'
        self._filled = True
        self._marker_function()
```

This corrected version of the `_recache` function checks if `_marker_function` is not `None` before making the call, ensuring that the function exits early when `_marker_function` is not assigned, addressing the bug.
