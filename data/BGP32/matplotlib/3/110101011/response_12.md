### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_recache` in the `MarkerStyle` class is supposed to reinitialize the marker style attributes based on the provided marker function. However, it fails to correctly set the `_filled` attribute to `False` when the `fillstyle` parameter is set to `'none'`.
2. The failing test `test_marker_fillstyle` checks if the `is_filled()` method returns `False` when `fillstyle` is set to `'none'` for a marker style with marker 'o' (circle).
3. The issue reported on GitHub indicates that setting `fillstyle='none'` does not result in hollow markers as expected when used in conjunction with `ax.scatter()`.
   
### Bug Cause:
The bug occurs because the `_filled` attribute is always set to `True` regardless of the `fillstyle` parameter being `'none'`. This leads to the marker being filled even when it should be hollow.

### Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to update the `_filled` attribute based on the provided `fillstyle`. When `fillstyle` is set to `'none'`, `_filled` should be set to `False` to create a hollow marker.

### Corrected Version:
```python
class MarkerStyle():
    # Corrected version of the _recache function
    def _recache(self):
        if self._marker_function is None:
            return
        self._path = _empty_path
        self._transform = IdentityTransform()
        self._alt_path = None
        self._alt_transform = None
        self._snap_threshold = None
        self._joinstyle = 'round'
        self._capstyle = 'butt'
        self._filled = self._fillstyle != 'none'
        self._marker_function()
```

By updating the `_filled` attribute based on the `fillstyle` parameter, we ensure that when `fillstyle` is set to `'none'`, the marker will be hollow as intended.

This corrected version should resolve the issue reported on GitHub and make the failing test `test_marker_fillstyle` pass successfully.
