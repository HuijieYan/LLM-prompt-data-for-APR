### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_recache` in the `MarkerStyle` class is responsible for setting default values for various attributes. The issue arises when the `fillstyle` attribute is not correctly handled, causing markers not to be hollow as intended.
2. The problem lies in the line `self._filled = True`, which sets `_filled` to `True` regardless of the `fillstyle` parameter provided.
3. Given the runtime values, we can see `_filled` is set to `True` unconditionally, which conflicts with the intention of setting `fillstyle='none'` to create hollow markers.
4. To fix the bug, we need to adjust the logic for setting the `_filled` variable based on the `fillstyle` parameter.
5. I have provided a corrected version below that accounts for the `fillstyle` parameter and correctly handles hollow markers.

### Corrected Version:
```python
class MarkerStyle():
    def _recache(self):
        if self._marker_function is None:
            return
        self._path = _empty_path
        self._transform = IdentityTransform()
        self._alt_path = None
        self._alt_transform = None
        self._snap_threshold = None
        self._joinstyle = 'round'
        self._capstyle = 'butt'
        self._filled = self._adjust_fillstyle()
        self._marker_function()

    def _adjust_fillstyle(self):
        return self._fillstyle == 'full'
```

By adding the `_adjust_fillstyle` method that checks if the `fillstyle` is set to 'full', we can appropriately handle the hollow markers based on the provided `fillstyle` parameter. This corrected version ensures that the `fillstyle='none'` setting leads to hollow markers as intended.
