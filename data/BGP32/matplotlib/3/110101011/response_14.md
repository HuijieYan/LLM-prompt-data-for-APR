Based on the provided information, the bug in the `_recache` function of the `MarkerStyle` class is related to the setting of the `_filled` attribute. When the `fillstyle` is set to `'none'`, the `_filled` attribute should be set to `False` to ensure that the marker is hollow, but the function is setting it to `True` unconditionally.

### Error Location:
The issue lies in the line `self._filled = True`. This line should be adjusted based on the `fillstyle` parameter.

### Cause of the Bug:
The bug occurs because the `_filled` attribute is always set to `True`, even when the desired `fillstyle` is `'none'`. This causes the markers to not be hollow when expected.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
We should update the `_filled` attribute based on the `fillstyle` parameter. If `fillstyle` is `'none'`, then `_filled` should be set to `False` to make the marker hollow.

### Corrected Version:

```python
class MarkerStyle():
    
    def _recache(self):
        if self._marker_function is None:
            return
        self._path = _empty_path
        self._transform = IdentityTransform()
        self._alt_path = None
        self._alt_transform = None
        self._snap_threshold = None
        self._joinstyle = 'round'
        self._capstyle = 'butt'
        if self._fillstyle == 'none':
            self._filled = False
        else:
            self._filled = True
        self._marker_function()
```

With this correction, the `_filled` attribute will be set to `False` when `fillstyle` is `'none', thereby making the marker hollow as intended.

This correction should address the reported issue on GitHub where markers are not hollow when using `ax.scatter()` with `fillstyle='none'`, ensuring that the markers appear as expected.
