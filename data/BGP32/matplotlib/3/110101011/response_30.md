### Bug Analysis:
The `_recache()` function in the `MarkerStyle` class is supposed to update certain attributes of the class instance. However, in its current state, it is not correctly setting the `_filled` attribute based on the provided input, which is leading to incorrect behavior when checking if a marker is filled or not.

### Error Location:
The bug is located in the `_recache()` function where the `_filled` attribute is always set to `True`, regardless of the provided `fillstyle`.

### Cause of the Bug:
The `_filled` attribute is set to `True` unconditionally at the end of the `_recache()` function, which overrides the desired `fillstyle='none'` behavior leading to filled markers instead of hollow ones.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To address this issue, we need to update the `_recache()` function to correctly set the `_filled` attribute based on the provided `fillstyle`.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
class MarkerStyle():
    def _recache(self):
        if self._marker_function is None:
            return
        self._path = _empty_path
        self._transform = IdentityTransform()
        self._alt_path = None
        self._alt_transform = None
        self._snap_threshold = None
        self._joinstyle = 'round'
        self._capstyle = 'butt'
        # Update the _filled attribute based on the fillstyle
        if self._fillstyle:
            self._filled = self._fillstyle != 'none'
        else:
            self._filled = True
        self._marker_function()
```

With this correction, the `_filled` attribute will be correctly set based on the provided `fillstyle`, allowing the `MarkerStyle` class to create hollow markers when the `fillstyle` is set to `'none'`.
