## Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_recache` in the `MarkerStyle` class is supposed to update various attributes of the class instance. However, the issue seems to be related to the marker's fillstyle not being set correctly.
2. The `_recache` function does not handle the `fillstyle` attribute, which is crucial for determining whether the marker should be filled or not. This leads to the unexpected behavior where markers are not hollow when `fillstyle='none'` is set.
3. The failing test `test_marker_fillstyle` tries to verify if the `fillstyle` of the `MarkerStyle` instance is correctly set to `'none'` and if `is_filled()` returns `False`, indicating that the marker should not be filled. The bug prevents these conditions from being met.
4. To fix the bug, the `_recache` function should include the logic to handle the `fillstyle` attribute properly, ensuring that the marker is correctly rendered as hollow when `fillstyle='none'` is set.

## Bug Fix:
```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: lib/matplotlib/markers.py

# The declaration of the class containing the corrected function
class MarkerStyle():
    
    # The corrected version of the buggy function
    def _recache(self):
        if self._marker_function is None:
            return
        self._path = _empty_path
        self._transform = IdentityTransform()
        self._alt_path = None
        self._alt_transform = None
        self._snap_threshold = None
        self._joinstyle = 'round'
        self._capstyle = 'butt'
        self._filled = True
        # Include logic to handle fillstyle attribute
        if 'fillstyle' in self._marker:
            if self._marker['fillstyle'] == 'none':
                self._filled = False
        self._marker_function()
```

By updating the `_recache` function to handle the `fillstyle` attribute correctly, the bug should be fixed, and the markers should render as hollow when `fillstyle='none'` is set. This correction should address the issue reported on GitHub as well.
