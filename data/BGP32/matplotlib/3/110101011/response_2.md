### Analysis:
The buggy function `_recache` in the `MarkerStyle` class is intended to reset certain attributes to default values and call a marker function if it exists. However, the issue lies in the logic around `_marker_function`. If `_marker_function` is None, it should not be called. The failing test `test_marker_fillstyle` aims to validate the behavior of setting the fillstyle of a marker style to 'none' but currently fails due to incorrect handling of `_marker_function`.

### Bug Cause:
The bug occurs because `_marker_function` is being called unconditionally in the buggy function `_recache`. This leads to potential errors, especially when `_marker_function` is None, as in the failing test.

### Fix Strategy:
1. Check if `_marker_function` is not None before calling it in the `_recache` function.
2. If `_marker_function` is None, simply return from the function without further processing.

### Corrected Version:
```python
class MarkerStyle():
    def _recache(self):
        if self._marker_function is None:
            return
        self._path = _empty_path
        self._transform = IdentityTransform()
        self._alt_path = None
        self._alt_transform = None
        self._snap_threshold = None
        self._joinstyle = 'round'
        self._capstyle = 'butt'
        self._filled = True
        self._marker_function()
```

By adding the conditional check for `_marker_function` in the `_recache` function, the corrected version should address the bug and allow the failing test `test_marker_fillstyle` to pass successfully.
