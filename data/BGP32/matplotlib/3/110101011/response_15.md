The buggy function `_recache` in the `MarkerStyle` class is not correctly handling the case where `self._marker_function` is not `None`. The issue is that it directly calls `self._marker_function()` without ensuring that it exists or is callable.

To fix this bug, we need to check if `self._marker_function` is callable before invoking it. If it is not callable, we should skip the function call and return early. 

Here is the corrected version of the `_recache` function:

```python
class MarkerStyle():
    def _recache(self):
        if self._marker_function is None:
            return
        
        if callable(self._marker_function):
            self._path = _empty_path
            self._transform = IdentityTransform()
            self._alt_path = None
            self._alt_transform = None
            self._snap_threshold = None
            self._joinstyle = 'round'
            self._capstyle = 'butt'
            self._filled = True
            self._marker_function()
```

By adding `if callable(self._marker_function)` check before the function call, we ensure that the `_recache` function will not break if `self._marker_function` is not callable.

This fix should address the issue reported in the GitHub post and allow the intended behavior of making markers hollow when setting fillstyle to 'none'.
