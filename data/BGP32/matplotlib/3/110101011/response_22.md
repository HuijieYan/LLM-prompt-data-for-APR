The bug in the `_recache` function is that it is calling `self._marker_function()` without checking if `_marker_function` is defined first. This leads to potential errors when `_marker_function` is `None`.

To fix this bug:
1. Check if `_marker_function` is not `None` before calling it.

Here is the corrected version of the `_recache` function:

```python
class MarkerStyle():

    def _recache(self):
        if self._marker_function is not None:
            self._path = _empty_path
            self._transform = IdentityTransform()
            self._alt_path = None
            self._alt_transform = None
            self._snap_threshold = None
            self._joinstyle = 'round'
            self._capstyle = 'butt'
            self._filled = True
            self._marker_function()
```

With this fix, the `_recache` function will only execute `_marker_function()` if it is defined, preventing any potential errors from occurring when `_marker_function` is `None`. This correction should address the issue reported on GitHub, allowing markers to be hollow when `fillstyle='none'` is set.
