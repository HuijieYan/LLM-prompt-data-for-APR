### Analysis:
The buggy function `_recache` within the `MarkerStyle` class resets various attributes without properly updating the `_marker_function`. This can lead to unexpected behavior when trying to set markers as hollow.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is caused by the `_recache` function resetting all attributes without properly handling the `_marker_function`. The `_marker_function` should be called and updated along with other attributes to ensure the desired behavior.

### Fix Strategy:
1. Ensure that the `_marker_function` is properly handled in the `_recache` function.
2. Check if the `_marker_function` needs to be updated or called in a specific way based on the provided marker settings.

### Corrected Version:
```python
class MarkerStyle():

    def _recache(self):
        if self._marker_function is None:
            return
        self._path = _empty_path
        self._transform = IdentityTransform()
        self._alt_path = None
        self._alt_transform = None
        self._snap_threshold = None
        self._joinstyle = 'round'
        self._capstyle = 'butt'
        self._filled = True
        # Update the _marker_function here
        self._marker_function = self._recache  # Assuming self._recache needs to be called
        self._marker_function()
```

With the corrected version above, the `_marker_function` is properly updated within the `_recache` function before it is called, ensuring that the marker settings are correctly handled. This should address the issue reported on GitHub and make the failing test pass.
