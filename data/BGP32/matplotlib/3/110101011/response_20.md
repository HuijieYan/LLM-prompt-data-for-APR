## Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_recache` in the `MarkerStyle` class initializes various attributes to default values, then attempts to call the `_marker_function` method regardless of whether it is defined or not.
2. The failing test `test_marker_fillstyle` checks if the `fillstyle` attribute is properly set to `'none'` and if the marker is not filled based on the configured style.
3. The runtime values and types of variables show that the `fillstyle` is not being correctly set to `'none'`, resulting in the marker being filled instead of hollow.
4. The bug occurs because the `_marker_function` method is called unconditionally without checking if it is defined or if it actually sets the fill properties.

## Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Modify the `_recache` function to check if `_marker_function` is not `None` before calling it to properly handle the fillstyle configuration.
2. Update the function to set the value of `_filled` based on the `fillstyle` attribute to ensure correct marker style.

## Corrected Version:
```python
# The corrected version of the buggy function
class MarkerStyle():
    def _recache(self):
        if self._marker_function is None:
            return
        self._path = _empty_path
        self._transform = IdentityTransform()
        self._alt_path = None
        self._alt_transform = None
        self._snap_threshold = None
        self._joinstyle = 'round'
        self._capstyle = 'butt'
        self._filled = self.get_fillstyle() != 'none'  # Update _filled based on fillstyle
        self._marker_function()
    
```

By making these changes, the corrected version of the function will properly set the `_filled` attribute based on the `fillstyle` configuration, ensuring that markers are correctly filled or hollow as specified. This correction should address the bug and allow the failing test to pass successfully.
