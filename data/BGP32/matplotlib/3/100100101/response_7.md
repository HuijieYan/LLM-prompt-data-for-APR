### Analysis
The `_recache` function is intended to reset various attributes of a marker object. However, the bug lies in the line `self._filled = True` which sets `self._filled` to `True` unconditionally, contrary to the `MarkerStyle` object's expected behavior.

### Bug Explanation
In the failing test, the `MarkerStyle` object is created with `fillstyle='none'`, which should result in `is_filled()` returning `False`. However, due to the bug in the `_recache` function setting `self._filled = True`, the `is_filled()` method incorrectly returns `True` instead of the expected `False`.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the `self._filled` attribute is set to the correct value based on the `fillstyle`. If `fillstyle` is `'none'`, then `self._filled` should be `False`.

### Corrected Version
```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    
    if self._fillstyle == 'none':
        self._filled = False
    else:
        self._filled = True
    
    self._marker_function()
``` 

By introducing a conditional check for `fillstyle` and setting `self._filled` accordingly, the corrected function should now behave as expected and pass the failing test.
