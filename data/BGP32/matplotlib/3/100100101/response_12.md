In the given buggy function `_recache(self)`, the main issue lies with the `_marker_function()` call. It seems that this function is supposed to update certain attributes based on the marker function, but it is called without any checks or error handling. This can potentially cause issues if `_marker_function` is not defined or has unexpected behavior.

To fix this bug, we can add a check before calling `_marker_function()` to ensure that it is not `None`. If it is `None`, we can skip this step to avoid potential errors.

Here is the corrected version of the `_recache(self)` function:

```python
# The relative path of the fixed file: lib/matplotlib/markers.py

def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = float('inf')
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    self._filled = False
    self._marker_function()
```

With this fix, the function will now check if `_marker_function` is defined before attempting to call it. This should prevent any potential errors related to calling an undefined function.

This corrected version should pass the failing test `test_marker_fillstyle()` with the expected input/output values.
