The bug in the `_recache` function is that it calls `self._marker_function()` without checking if it exists or not. This can lead to an AttributeError if `self._marker_function` is not defined. We need to add a check to ensure that `_marker_function` is not `None` before calling it.

Here is the corrected version of the `_recache` function:

```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: lib/matplotlib/markers.py

def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is not None:
        self._path = _empty_path
        self._transform = IdentityTransform()
        self._alt_path = None
        self._alt_transform = None
        self._snap_threshold = None
        self._joinstyle = 'round'
        self._capstyle = 'butt'
        self._filled = True
        self._marker_function()
``` 

With this correction, the function will only call `_marker_function()` if it is not `None`, preventing any AttributeError from occurring.

This corrected version will satisfy the expected input/output values for the failing test case provided.
