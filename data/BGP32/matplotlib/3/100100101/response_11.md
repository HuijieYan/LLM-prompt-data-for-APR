### Analysis
The `_recache` function initializes several attributes of the object to default values and then calls a marker function. However, in the buggy version, it checks if the `self._marker_function` is `None` before proceeding, which is causing the function to return early without completing the necessary setup.

### Bug Explanation
In the failing test `test_marker_fillstyle`, the marker style is created with `fillstyle='none'`. This means that the `get_fillstyle()` method should return `'none'` and `is_filled()` should return `False`. However, since the `_marker_function` is not being called properly due to the early return in the `_recache` function, the `is_filled()` method does not correctly reflect the expected behavior.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to remove the early return condition based on `self._marker_function` and ensure that the marker function is always called after setting the default values for the attributes.

### Corrected Version
```python
def _recache(self):
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    self._filled = True
    
    if self._marker_function is not None:
        self._marker_function()
``` 

By making these changes, the corrected version of the `_recache` function will always initialize the attributes to their default values and then execute the marker function if it is not `None`, ensuring that the test `test_marker_fillstyle` passes as expected.
