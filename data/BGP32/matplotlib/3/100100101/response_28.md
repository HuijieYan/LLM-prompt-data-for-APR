### Analysis
The `_recache` function is supposed to reset certain attributes of the MarkerStyle class to default values and then call the `_marker_function` method. However, in the buggy implementation, it only sets the attributes to default values without calling `_marker_function`. This results in the expected output not being achieved.

### Bug Explanation
In the failing test `test_marker_fillstyle`, the `MarkerStyle` object is created with `fillstyle='none'`, which means that the expected value of `marker_style.is_filled()` should be `False`, indicating that the marker is not filled. However, since the `_marker_function` is not called in the `_recache` function, the `_filled` attribute is not updated and remains `True`, causing the test to fail.

### Bug Fix
To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the `_marker_function` is called at the end of the `_recache` function so that all attributes are correctly set. This will ensure that the expected values are achieved during the failing test.

### Corrected Version
```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    self._filled = True
    self._marker_function()
``` 

By adding the `_marker_function()` call at the end of the `_recache` function, the corrected version will update all necessary attributes and pass the failing test `test_marker_fillstyle`.
