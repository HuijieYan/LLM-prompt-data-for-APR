## Analysis
The `_recache` function initializes several internal variables and then calls the `_marker_function`. However, the issue lies in the line `self._filled = True`, where it should be set to `False` according to the failing test scenario. This causes the function to not pass the provided test case.

## Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to update the line `self._filled = True` to `self._filled = False` in the `_recache` function. This change will ensure that the `_filled` variable is correctly set to `False` as expected by the failing test.

## The corrected version of the buggy function
```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    self._filled = False  # Fix: Set _filled to False instead of True
    self._marker_function()
``` 

By making this adjustment, the `_recache` function should now pass the failing test case by ensuring that `_filled` is correctly set to `False`.
