The bug in the `_recache` function is that the `self._marker_function()` is called unconditionally without checking if it is defined. This can lead to errors if `self._marker_function` is not set.

To fix this bug, we need to add a check to ensure that `self._marker_function` is not None before calling it.

Here's the corrected version of the `_recache` function:

```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: lib/matplotlib/markers.py

def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is not None:
        self._path = _empty_path
        self._transform = IdentityTransform()
        self._alt_path = None
        self._alt_transform = None
        self._snap_threshold = None
        self._joinstyle = 'round'
        self._capstyle = 'butt'
        self._filled = True
        self._marker_function()
```

By adding the check `if self._marker_function is not None:`, we ensure that the `_marker_function` is only called if it is defined, preventing potential errors. Now the function should pass the failing test `test_marker_fillstyle` as expected.
