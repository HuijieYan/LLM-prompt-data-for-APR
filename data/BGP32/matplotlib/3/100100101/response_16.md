The bug in the `_recache` function lies in the incorrect initialization of the `_filled` attribute. The function wrongly sets `_filled` to `True` instead of `False`. This mistake leads to the failing test case `test_marker_fillstyle`, where it expects `is_filled()` to return `False` for a marker with fillstyle 'none', but due to the bug, it returns `True`.

To fix this bug, we need to correct the initialization of the `_filled` attribute to `False` as expected in all cases.

Here is the corrected version of the `_recache` function:

```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    self._filled = False  # Corrected initialization
    self._marker_function()

```

By making this correction, the `_recache` function will now correctly initialize the `_filled` attribute to `False`, and the failing test case `test_marker_fillstyle` will pass as expected.
