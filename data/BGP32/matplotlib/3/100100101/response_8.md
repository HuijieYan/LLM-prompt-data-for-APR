The bug in the `_recache` function stems from not initializing the `self._marker_function` attribute before calling it in the last line of the function. This leads to an AttributeError and causes the failing test because `self._marker_function` is not defined.

To fix this bug, we need to make sure `self._marker_function` is properly initialized before calling it in the `_recache` function.

Here is the corrected version of the `_recache` function:

```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: lib/matplotlib/markers.py

def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = float('inf')
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    self._filled = False
    
    # Proper initialization of the marker function
    if callable(self._marker_function):
        self._marker_function()
```

With this correction, the `_marker_function` attribute is checked to ensure it is callable before invoking it, thus preventing the AttributeError. This corrected version should now pass the failing test case `test_marker_fillstyle`.
