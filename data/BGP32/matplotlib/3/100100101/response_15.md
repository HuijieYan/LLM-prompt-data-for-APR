### Analysis
The buggy function `_recache` is supposed to reset certain attributes to default values and then call a marker function. However, it fails to properly reset the `_filled` attribute to `False`. This causes the test `test_marker_fillstyle` to fail when checking if the marker style is not filled.


### Bug Explanation
In the buggy function `_recache`, the `_filled` attribute is set to `True` unconditionally. This overrides the `fillstyle='none'` setting provided in the failing test, causing the test to fail when checking if the marker style is not filled.


### Bug Fix
To fix this bug, we need to set the `_filled` attribute to `False` according to the fill style specified in the marker style. We can achieve this by adding a conditional statement to check if the fill style is `'none'` and then set `_filled` to `False` accordingly.


### Corrected Version
```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    self._filled = self._fillstyle != 'none'
    self._marker_function()
``` 

After applying this correction, the `_filled` attribute will be set based on the fill style specified in the marker style, allowing the failing test to pass successfully.
