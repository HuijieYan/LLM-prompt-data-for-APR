The buggy function `_recache` is supposed to update internal attributes based on the marker function if it is not None. However, the function was always setting `_filled` to `True` regardless of the actual value.

The bug causes the `_filled` attribute to be always set to `True`, which contradicts the expected value in the failing test.

To fix the bug, we need to update the `_filled` attribute based on the fillstyle provided. If the fillstyle is `'none'`, then `_filled` should be set to `False`.

Here is the corrected version of the `_recache` function:

```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    self._filled = self._fillstyle != 'none'
    self._marker_function()
```

By updating the `_filled` attribute based on the `fillstyle`, the corrected function should now pass the failing test case.
