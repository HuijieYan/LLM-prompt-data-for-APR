The bug in the `_recache` function lies in the incorrect assignment of the `_filled` attribute. The function is setting `_filled` to `True` unconditionally, whereas it should reflect the fillstyle of the marker.

### Cause of the bug:
- The bug is caused by setting `_filled` to `True` unconditionally in the `_recache` function, regardless of the actual fillstyle of the marker.

### Strategy for fixing the bug:
- We need to update the `_filled` attribute based on the `fillstyle` of the marker.

### Corrected version of the `_recache` function:
```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    self._filled = self._fillstyle != 'none'  # Set _filled based on fillstyle
    self._marker_function()
```

By correcting the `_recache` function as shown above, the `_filled` attribute will be updated according to the fillstyle of the marker, which will fix the bug and make the function behave as expected in the failing test case.
