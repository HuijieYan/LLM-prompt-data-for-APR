The bug in the `_recache` function lies in the setting of the `_filled` attribute. The function is currently setting `_filled` to `True` unconditionally, irrespective of the fillstyle specified in the marker style.

To fix this bug, we need to update the `_filled` attribute based on the fillstyle specified in the marker style object.

Here is the corrected version of the `_recache` function:

```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    self._filled = self._fillstyle != 'none'  # Update _filled based on fillstyle
    self._marker_function()
```

By updating the `_filled` attribute based on the fillstyle, the corrected function will now correctly reflect whether the marker should be filled or not.

This correction will ensure that the `_recache` function behaves according to the expected input/output values during the failing test execution.
