### Analysis
The error message indicates that the `is_filled` method is returning `True` when it should be returning `False`. This suggests that the `_filled` attribute is not being properly set to `False` within the `_recache` function.

### Bug Explanation
The bug is likely occurring because the `_filled` attribute is being set to `True` at the end of the `_recache` function. This is contrary to the expected behavior where `_filled` should be set to `False` based on the failing test case.

### Fix Strategy
To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the `_filled` attribute is set correctly within the `_recache` function. We should change its value to `False` at the beginning of the function instead of setting it to `True`. This will align with the expected behavior based on the failing test case.

### Corrected Version
```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._filled = False
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    self._marker_function()
```
