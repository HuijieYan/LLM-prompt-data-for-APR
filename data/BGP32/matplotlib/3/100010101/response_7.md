### Analysis
The error message indicates that the `is_filled` method is returning `True` when it should be returning `False`. This suggests that the `_filled` attribute of the `MarkerStyle` class is not being properly set to `False`.

### Bug cause
In the `_recache` function, the `_filled` attribute is set to `True` unconditionally. This causes the `MarkerStyle` objects to always return `True` for `is_filled`. This is the cause of the bug.

### Bug fix strategy
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the `_filled` attribute is set based on the value of `fillstyle` provided when creating a `MarkerStyle` object. If the `fillstyle` is `'none'`, `_filled` should be set to `False`, otherwise set it to `True`.

### Corrected version of the function
```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    self._filled = self._fillstyle != 'none'
    self._marker_function()
``` 

By updating the `_filled` attribute based on the value of `fillstyle`, we can ensure that the `is_filled` method returns the correct value according to the `fillstyle` specified when creating a `MarkerStyle` object. This should fix the bug and make the failing test pass.
