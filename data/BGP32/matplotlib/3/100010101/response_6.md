### Analysis:
The error message indicates that the `is_filled()` method is returning `True` instead of the expected `False`. The bug seems to be related to the `_filled` attribute not being set correctly in the `_recache` function.

### Bug Cause:
The `_filled` attribute is being set to `True` unconditionally in the `_recache` function. This causes the `is_filled()` method to always return `True`, leading to the failing test assertion.

### Bug Fix:
We should set the `_filled` attribute based on the `self._fillstyle` attribute. If the `fillstyle` is `'none'`, then `_filled` should be set to `False`. Otherwise, `_filled` should be set to `True`.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    self._filled = self._fillstyle != 'none'  # Set filled based on fillstyle
    self._marker_function()
``` 

By updating the `_recache` function to set the `_filled` attribute based on the `fillstyle`, we can ensure that the `is_filled()` method returns the correct value according to the fillstyle provided. This should fix the bug and make the failing test pass.
