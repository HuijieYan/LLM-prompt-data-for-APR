### Analysis
The buggy function `_recache` is supposed to reset certain attributes to their default values when `self._marker_function` is not None. However, it seems to be missing the logic to process the `fillstyle` attribute, which leads to the failing test asserting that the marker is filled when it should not be.

### Bug Explanation
The buggy function does not handle the `fillstyle` attribute, which causes the `is_filled` method to return True even when the `fillstyle` is set to 'none'. This bug leads to the failing test case.

### Bug Fix
To fix this issue, we need to update the `_recache` function to consider the `fillstyle` attribute. We can modify the function to set the `_filled` attribute based on the `fillstyle`, where if the `fillstyle` is 'none', then `_filled` should be set to False.

### Corrected Version
```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    self._filled = self._fillstyle != 'none'
    self._marker_function()
```

By updating the `_recache` function with the corrected logic for handling the `fillstyle` attribute, the function should now correctly set the `_filled` attribute, enabling the failing test case to pass.
