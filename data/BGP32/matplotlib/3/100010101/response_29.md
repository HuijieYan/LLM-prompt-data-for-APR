The buggy function `_recache` is not setting the `_filled` attribute correctly which leads to the failing test. The expected value of `_filled` should be `False` for the test to pass.

To fix this bug, we need to set `_filled` attribute to `False` instead of `True` in the `_recache` function.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    self._filled = False # Fix: Set _filled to False instead of True
    self._marker_function()
```

With this fix, the test should now pass as the `_filled` attribute will be correctly set to `False`.
