### Analysis
The buggy function `_recache` is supposed to reset certain attributes of a marker style object. The failing test is checking the `is_filled` method of the `MarkerStyle` object after calling the `_recache` function. The error message indicates that the assertion `assert not marker_style.is_filled()` failed, which means the marker style is incorrectly marked as filled when it should not be.

### Bug
The bug lies in the fact that the `_filled` attribute is set to `True` unconditionally in the `_recache` function. This causes the marker to be considered filled even when it should not be.

### Fix
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the `_filled` attribute is set based on the actual fill style passed when creating the `MarkerStyle` object. If the fill style is `'none'`, then `_filled` should be set to `False`.

### Corrected Version
```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    self._filled = self._fillstyle != 'none'
    self._marker_function()
``` 

With this correction, the `_filled` attribute will be set based on the fill style specified when creating the `MarkerStyle` object. This change ensures that the marker style is correctly marked as filled or not filled based on the actual fill style.
