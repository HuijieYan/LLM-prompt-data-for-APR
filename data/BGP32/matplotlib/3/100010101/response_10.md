The buggy function `_recache` is not correctly setting the `_filled` attribute. The function is setting `_filled` to `True` unconditionally, while the expected output in the failing test is asserting `marker_style.is_filled()` to be `False`.

To fix this bug, we need to update the `_recache` function to set the `_filled` attribute based on the value of `self._fillstyle`.

Here is the corrected version of the `_recache` function:

```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    self._filled = self._fillstyle != 'none'
    self._marker_function()
```

This correction ensures that the `_filled` attribute is set according to the value of `self._fillstyle`. By making this adjustment, the corrected function will pass the failing test and meet the expected input/output values.
