### Analysis
The error message indicates that the `MarkerStyle.is_filled` method is returning `True` instead of the expected `False`. This suggests that the `_filled` attribute is not being correctly set to `False` in the `_recache` function.

### Bug
The bug lies in the assignment of the `_filled` attribute within the `_recache` function. It is currently being set to `True` unconditionally, which is incorrect based on the expected input/output values for the test.

### Fix
To fix this bug, we need to correctly set the `_filled` attribute based on the `fillstyle` parameter passed to the `MarkerStyle` object.

### Corrected Version
```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    self._filled = self._fillstyle != 'none'
    self._marker_function()
``` 

By updating the assignment of the `_filled` attribute to `self._fillstyle != 'none'`, we ensure that the `_filled` attribute reflects the correct status based on the `fillstyle` parameter. This should resolve the bug and make the `is_filled` method return the expected value in the test.
