The bug in the `_recache` function is that it is not correctly setting the `_filled` attribute based on the fillstyle specified for the marker. 

### Cause of the Bug:
The `MarkerStyle` object needs to set the `_filled` attribute based on the fillstyle specified. In the failing test, the fillstyle is set to `'none'`, which means the marker should not be filled (`_filled` should be `False`). However, the `_filled` attribute is set to `True` unconditionally in the buggy function.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
We need to modify the `_recache` function to correctly set the `_filled` attribute based on the fillstyle specified for the marker. 

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    
    if self._fillstyle == 'none':
        self._filled = False
    else:
        self._filled = True

    self._marker_function()
```

By adding the condition to check the fillstyle and set `_filled` accordingly, the corrected version of the function will ensure that the marker's fill attribute is correctly determined based on the fillstyle specified.
This corrected version should pass the failing test case.
