### Analysis
The buggy function `_recache` initializes certain attributes of a MarkerStyle object, including setting `self._filled` to `True` by default. In the failing test, the expected value of `is_filled()` is `False`, which indicates that the `_filled` attribute is not being correctly set during the `_recache` process.

### Bug Cause
The bug occurs because `_recache` sets `self._filled = True` unconditionally, regardless of the initial fillstyle set for the MarkerStyle object.

### Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we should consider the fillstyle provided in the MarkerStyle object and set the `_filled` attribute accordingly. If the fillstyle is `'none'`, then `_filled` should be set to `False`, otherwise, it should be set to `True`.

### The corrected version of the function
```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: lib/matplotlib/markers.py

def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    
    if self._fillstyle == 'none':
        self._filled = False
    else:
        self._filled = True
        
    self._marker_function()
```

After applying this fix, the `_recache` function will correctly set the `_filled` attribute based on the fillstyle provided in the MarkerStyle object. This will ensure that the test case regarding the `is_filled()` method will pass as expected.
