### Analysis
The error message indicates that the `is_filled` method returns `True` when it should be returning `False` due to the fillstyle being set to `'none'`. This suggests that the `is_filled` method is not behaving correctly.

Looking at the `_recache` function, it sets `self._filled` to `True` unconditionally, which is incorrect when the fillstyle is set to `'none'`. This leads to the `is_filled` method returning `True` incorrectly.

### Bug Cause
The bug is caused by the `_recache` function unconditionally setting `self._filled` to `True`, regardless of the fillstyle being set to `'none'`.

### Fix Strategy
To fix this bug, we need to update the `_recache` function to consider the fillstyle when setting the `_filled` attribute. If the fillstyle is `'none'`, then `_filled` should be set to `False`.

### The corrected function
```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: lib/matplotlib/markers.py

def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    self._filled = self._fillstyle != 'none'  # Update _filled based on fillstyle
    self._marker_function()
``` 

By updating the `_filled` attribute based on the fillstyle, the corrected function will ensure that the `is_filled` method behaves as expected based on the fillstyle being set. This fix will address the bug and pass the failing test.
