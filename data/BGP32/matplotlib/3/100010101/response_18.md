### Analysis
The buggy function `_recache` is supposed to recache attributes related to marker styles. The error message indicates that the `is_filled` method returns `True` when it should return `False`. This suggests that the `_filled` attribute is not being set correctly in the `_recache` function.

### Bug Cause
The bug is caused by the `_filled` attribute being set to `True` unconditionally in the `_recache` function. This leads to the `is_filled` method always returning `True`, even when it should return `False`.

### Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to correctly set the `_filled` attribute based on the `fillstyle` value provided during the initialization of the `MarkerStyle`.

### The corrected version of the function
```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    
    if self._fillstyle == 'none':
        self._filled = False
    else:
        self._filled = True

    self._marker_function()
```

With this correction, the `MarkerStyle` object will correctly set the `_filled` attribute based on the provided `fillstyle` value, which should make the `is_filled` method return the expected result in the test case.
