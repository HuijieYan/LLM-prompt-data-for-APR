### Analysis
The failing test expects `assert not marker_style.is_filled()` to return `True`, but it is returning `False`, indicating a bug in the `is_filled` method implementation. The `_recache` method sets `self._filled` to `True`, causing the issue.

### Bug Cause
The bug is caused because in the `_recache` method, `self._filled` is always set to `True`, regardless of the actual fillstyle. This incorrect assignment leads to the `is_filled` method returning `True` even when it should not.

### Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to update the `_recache` method to correctly reflect the fillstyle. The `_filled` attribute should be set based on the fillstyle of the marker.

### Updated Function
Here is the corrected version of the `_recache` method:

```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    
    if self._fillstyle == 'none':
        self._filled = False
    else:
        self._filled = True
    
    self._marker_function()
```

This updated version correctly sets the `_filled` attribute based on the fillstyle of the marker, which should now resolve the bug and make the test pass.
