The bug in the `_recache` function is that it is not properly setting the `_filled` attribute based on the `fillstyle` value. The function is always setting `_filled` to `True` regardless of the `fillstyle` provided.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is caused by not updating the `_filled` attribute based on the `fillstyle` value. In the failing test case, the `fillstyle` is set to `'none'`, indicating that the marker should not be filled. However, the `_filled` attribute is being set to `True` unconditionally in the buggy function, leading to the incorrect behavior.

### Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to update the `_filled` attribute based on the `fillstyle` provided. If the `fillstyle` is `'none'`, then `_filled` should be set to `False`. If the `fillstyle` is not `'none'`, then `_filled` can be set to `True`.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    
    if self._fillstyle == 'none':
        self._filled = False
    else:
        self._filled = True
    
    self._marker_function()
```

By updating the `_filled` attribute based on the `fillstyle` value, the corrected function should now properly reflect the fillstyle setting for markers. This correction will address the failing test case and ensure that the expected input/output values are satisfied.
