### Analysis:
The buggy function `_recache` is failing to correctly set the `_filled` attribute to `False`, which causes the `is_filled()` method to return `True` instead of `False`. This results in the failing test `assert not marker_style.is_filled()`.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is caused by not setting the `_filled` attribute to `False` in the `_recache` function.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that `_filled` is set to `False` in the `_recache` function.

### The corrected version of the function:
```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: lib/matplotlib/markers.py

# corrected version of the _recache function
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    self._filled = False  # corrected line
    self._marker_function()
```

After making this correction, the `_filled` attribute will be set to `False` in the `_recache` function, and the failing test `assert not marker_style.is_filled()` should pass successfully.
