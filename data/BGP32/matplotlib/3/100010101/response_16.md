### Analysis
The error message indicates that the `is_filled()` method is returning `True` when it should be returning `False`. This suggests that the `_filled` attribute is not being set correctly in the `_recache` function.

### Bug
The bug is caused by setting `self._filled = True` in the `_recache` function, which should be set to `False` according to the expected values and types.

### Fix
Change `self._filled = True` to `self._filled = False` in the `_recache` function.

### The corrected version of the function
```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    self._filled = False
    self._marker_function()
```
