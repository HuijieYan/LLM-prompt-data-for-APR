## Analysis
1. The `_recache` function is used to reset marker properties. However, in its current state, it always sets `_filled` to True regardless of the input marker properties.
2. The failing test case `test_marker_fillstyle` expects the marker to be hollow when the `fillstyle` is set to 'none', but due to the bug in the `_recache` function, the marker is not hollow.
3. The cause of the bug is that `_filled` is always set to True irrespective of the `fillstyle`. This results in markers not being hollow even when `fillstyle` is set to 'none'.
4. To fix the bug, we need to update the `_recache` function to consider the `fillstyle` parameter when setting the `_filled` property.

## Bug Fix
```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    if hasattr(self, '_fillstyle') and self._fillstyle == 'none':
        self._filled = False
    else:
        self._filled = True
    self._marker_function()
```

By checking if the `_fillstyle` is 'none' before setting `_filled` to False, we ensure that markers will be hollow when the `fillstyle` is explicitly set to 'none'. This fix aligns the behavior with the expectations of the failing test case and resolves the issue posted on GitHub related to markers not being hollow when `fillstyle` is set to 'none'.
