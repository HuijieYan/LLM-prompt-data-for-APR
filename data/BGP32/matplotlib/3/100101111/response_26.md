### Analysis:
The `_recache` function in the `markers.py` module is responsible for resetting some attributes and calling the `_marker_function`. In the failing test case, the `test_marker_fillstyle` function is trying to create a `MarkerStyle` object with `fillstyle='none'` and checks if the fillstyle is set correctly. However, the expected behavior is not achieved due to the `self._filled` attribute being set to `True` instead of `False` after the `_recache` function call. This discrepancy causes the failing test.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is caused by setting `self._filled` to `True` unconditionally in the `_recache` function, which conflicts with the expectation to have `fillstyle='none'` resulting in a hollow marker. This discrepancy arises due to the oversight in resetting the `_filled` attribute based on the intended `fillstyle`.

### Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we should set the `self._filled` attribute based on the `fillstyle` value rather than unconditionally setting it to `True`.

### The corrected version:
```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    self._filled = self._fillstyle != 'none'  # Set filled based on fillstyle
    self._marker_function()
```

By updating the `_recache` function to consider the `fillstyle` value when setting the `_filled` attribute, the corrected version ensures that the MarkerStyle object behaves as expected, allowing the `test_marker_fillstyle` test case to pass and resolve the issue reported on GitHub.
