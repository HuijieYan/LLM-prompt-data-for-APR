### Analysis:
1. The `_recache` function in the `markers.py` file is supposed to reset the marker properties to default values and then call the `_marker_function`. The issue arises when the `_filled` property is set to `True` instead of being set to `False` after resetting.
2. The failing test `test_marker_fillstyle` expects the marker fillstyle to be `'none'` and for the marker to be hollow (`is_filled()` should return `False`).
3. The bug causes the marker to be filled even when `fillstyle` is set to `'none'`, which contradicts the expected behavior in the failing test. This happens due to the incorrect setting of `_filled` to `True` instead of `False`.
4. To fix the bug, the `_filled` property should be set to `False` after resetting the marker properties in the `_recache` function.
5. Below is the corrected version of the `_recache` function:

### Corrected Version:
```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    self._filled = False  # Changed from True to False
    self._marker_function()
```

By making this change, the marker will be rendered as hollow when the `fillstyle` is set to `'none'`, as expected.
