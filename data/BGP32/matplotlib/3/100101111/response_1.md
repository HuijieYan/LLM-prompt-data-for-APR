### Analysis:
1. The `_recache` function in the `markers.py` file initializes certain attributes with default values and calls a marker function when it is not `None`.
2. The failing test `test_marker_fillstyle` requires the `MarkerStyle` to have its `fillstyle` attribute set to `'none'` and check if it is not filled.
3. The issue reported on GitHub suggests that setting `fillstyle='none'` does not result in hollow markers as expected.

### Error Location:
The bug seems to lie in the `_recache` function where the `_filled` attribute is always set to `True`, regardless of the passed parameters.

### Cause of the Bug:
- In the failing case, the `MarkerStyle` object should have `fillstyle='none'` resulting in not being filled. However, due to the `_filled` attribute being set to `True` unconditionally in the `_recache` function, it prevents the expected behavior of hollow markers.

### Fix Strategy:
- Modify the `_recache` function to set the `_filled` attribute based on the actual `fillstyle` value passed during the initialization of the `MarkerStyle` object.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    self._filled = self._fillstyle != 'none'
    self._marker_function()
```

By updating the `_filled` attribute assignment to reflect the actual value of `fillstyle`, the corrected function should now correctly handle cases where `fillstyle='none'`, ensuring that the markers are hollow as expected.
