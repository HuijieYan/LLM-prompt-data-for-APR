### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_recache` is supposed to update the marker attributes based on the `_marker_function` if it is not `None`.
2. The failing test checks if a marker's fillstyle is set to `'none'`, which should result in a hollow marker.
3. In the failing test execution, the `_filled` attribute is not updated to `False`, hence the marker is not rendered as hollow.
4. The expected behavior is for the marker to be hollow when the fillstyle is set to `'none'`.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to update the `_filled` attribute based on the fillstyle set. If the fillstyle is set to `'none'`, then `_filled` should be set to `False` to render the marker as hollow.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    
    if hasattr(self, '_fillstyle') and self._fillstyle == 'none':
        self._filled = False
    else:
        self._filled = True
        
    self._marker_function()
``` 

By updating the `_recache` function with the corrected logic to check the fillstyle and set the `_filled` attribute accordingly, the bug should be fixed. Now, the marker should render as hollow when the fillstyle is set to `'none'`.
