To fix the bug in the `_recache` function, we need to adjust the logic related to setting the `_filled` attribute. Currently, the function sets `_filled` to `True` unconditionally, which contradicts the expected behavior in some cases where the fill style should be `'none'` resulting in a hollow marker.

Here is the corrected version of the `_recache` function:

```python
# The relative path of the file: lib/matplotlib/markers.py

def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    self._filled = self._fillstyle not in ['none']
    self._marker_function()
```

Explanation:
- In the corrected version, `_filled` is determined based on the value of `_fillstyle`. If `_fillstyle` is not `'none'`, then `_filled` is set to `True`, indicating a filled marker. If `_fillstyle` is specifically `'none'`, then `_filled` is set to `False`, resulting in a hollow marker.

By applying this change, the marker style with `fillstyle='none'` will correctly render markers as hollow when using `ax.scatter()` as reported in the GitHub issue. This adjustment aligns the function's behavior with the expected values and resolves the problem users are facing.
