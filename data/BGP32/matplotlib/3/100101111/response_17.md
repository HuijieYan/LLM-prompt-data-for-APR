The bug in the provided function `_recache` is that it sets the `_filled` attribute to `True` unconditionally instead of using the specified `fillstyle` parameter. This leads to markers not appearing hollow when the intention is to have them empty.

To fix this issue, we need to update the `_filled` attribute based on the `fillstyle` parameter passed to the `MarkerStyle` class.

Here is the corrected version of the `_recache` function:
```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'

    # Update the _filled attribute based on fillstyle
    if self._fillstyle == 'none':
        self._filled = False
    else:
        self._filled = True

    self._marker_function()
```

Now, when creating a `MarkerStyle` object with `fillstyle='none'`, the markers will appear hollow as expected.

This corrected version addresses the issue mentioned in the GitHub report where markers were not appearing hollow when setting `fillstyle='none'`.
