### Issue Analysis:
The bug occurs in the `_recache` function of the markers module in Matplotlib. The function is supposed to recache marker properties but fails to correctly handle the `filled` property when `fillstyle` is set to `none`. This issue causes markers to not appear as hollow when expected.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is caused by not updating the `_filled` property based on the `fillstyle` parameter. This leads to incorrect marker appearances when trying to create hollow markers.

### Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to update the `_filled` property based on the `fillstyle` parameter. If the `fillstyle` is set to `'none'`, the `_filled` property should be set to `False`.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    self._filled = self._fillstyle != 'none'
    self._marker_function()
```

By updating the `_filled` property based on the `fillstyle` value, the corrected function will now correctly handle hollow markers when the `fillstyle` is set to `'none'`. This change resolves the issue reported on GitHub regarding markers not appearing as hollow when using `ax.scatter()` with a custom `MarkerStyle`.
