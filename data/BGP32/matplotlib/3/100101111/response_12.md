### Analysis:
1. The `_recache` function is called to update the marker's properties based on the `_marker_function`, but the issue arises from setting `_filled` to `True`. This causes markers to be filled even when the `fillstyle` is set to `'none'`.
2. The failing test `test_marker_fillstyle` checks if the `fillstyle` correctly returns `'none'` and ensures that the marker is not filled. However, due to the bug in the `_recache` function, the test fails.
3. The cause of the bug is that `_filled` is always set to `True` in the `_recache` function regardless of the `fillstyle` setting, leading to incorrect marker visualization.
4. To fix the bug, we need to update the `_filled` variable based on the `fillstyle` setting. If `fillstyle` is `'none'`, `_filled` should be set to `False` to achieve hollow markers.

### Bug Fix:
```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    self._filled = self._fillstyle != 'none'  # Update _filled based on fillstyle
    self._marker_function()
```

### Corrected Version:
The corrected version of the `_recache` function now includes updating the `_filled` variable based on the `fillstyle` setting, ensuring that markers display as intended. This fix addresses the bug reported in the failing test and GitHub issue.
