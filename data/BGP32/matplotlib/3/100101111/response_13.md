### Analyzing the buggy function and failing test:
1. The buggy function `_recache` initializes various attributes and then calls `_marker_function` if it exists.
2. The failing test `test_marker_fillstyle` creates a `MarkerStyle` instance with `fillstyle='none'` and checks if `get_fillstyle()` returns the expected value and if the marker style is filled.
3. The runtime values for the function's attributes show that `_filled` is set to `True` before calling `_marker_function`, which contradicts the expected behavior set by the failing test.

### Error location:
The issue lies in the fact that `_filled` is always set to `True` in the `_recache` function, which prevents markers from being filled, even when `fillstyle='none'` is used.

### Cause of the bug:
The bug occurs because `_filled` is being set to `True` unconditionally in the `_recache` function, which overrides the desired behavior of having hollow markers when `fillstyle='none'`.

### Strategy for fixing the bug:
To fix the bug, we need to update the `_recache` function to correctly handle the `fillstyle='none'` case by setting `_filled` to `False` when the fillstyle is explicitly set to 'none'.

### Corrected version of the function:
```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    self._filled = self._fillstyle != 'none'
    self._marker_function()
```

By updating the `_recache` function to set `_filled` based on the `fillstyle` attribute, we ensure that the markers will be hollow when `fillstyle='none'`.
