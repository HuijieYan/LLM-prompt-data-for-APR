The issue in the provided code is that the `_filled` attribute is always set to `True`, regardless of the `fillstyle` parameter. This prevents the markers from being hollow when the `fillstyle` is set to `'none'`.

To fix this issue, we need to update the `_filled` attribute based on the `fillstyle` parameter. If the `fillstyle` is set to `'none'`, then `_filled` should be set to `False`.

Here is the corrected version of the `_recache` function:

```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    self._filled = False if self.get_fillstyle() == "none" else True
    self._marker_function()
```

This correction will ensure that the `markers` are hollow when the `fillstyle` is set to `'none'`, as expected. This change addresses the issue reported on GitHub where the markers were not hollow when using `ax.scatter()` with a custom `markers.MarkerStyle` and setting `fillstyle` to `'none'. The expected behavior after applying the correction is that the markers will indeed be hollow.
