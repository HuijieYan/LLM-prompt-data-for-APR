## Bug Analysis
1. The `_recache` function in the file `markers.py` is not correctly handling the `filled` property when setting the marker style. It always sets `_filled` to `True`, overriding any intended value.
2. The failing test case `test_marker_fillstyle` checks if a marker with `fillstyle='none'` is actually set to 'none' and not filled. However, due to the bug mentioned above, the marker is always filled regardless of the `fillstyle` parameter.

## Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, the `_filled` property should be set based on the provided `fillstyle` when initializing the marker style. If `fillstyle` is 'none', then `_filled` should be set to `False`.

## Corrected Version of the Function
```python
# Corrected version of the buggy function
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    if self._fillstyle == 'none':
        self._filled = False
    else:
        self._filled = True
    self._marker_function()
``` 

By implementing the corrected version of the function, the `is_filled()` method will now return `False` when the `fillstyle` is set to 'none' as expected in the failing test case. This resolves the issue raised in the GitHub report as well.
