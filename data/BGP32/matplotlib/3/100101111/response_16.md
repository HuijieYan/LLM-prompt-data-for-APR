### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_recache` initializes various attributes related to marker style, but it does not set the `filled` attribute based on the provided `MarkerStyle` parameters.
2. The failing test `test_marker_fillstyle` expects the marker to be hollow (`fillstyle='none'`), but the `filled` attribute is always set to `True` in the buggy function.
3. The provided GitHub issue confirms that there is an expectation for markers to be hollow when `fillstyle='none'`, which is not currently met by the implementation.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is caused by not updating the `filled` attribute based on the `MarkerStyle` parameters. The `filled` attribute is set to `True` unconditionally in the `_recache` function, preventing markers from being hollow when `fillstyle='none'`.

### Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, the `_recache` function needs to consider the `fillstyle` attribute of the `MarkerStyle` and update the `filled` attribute accordingly. If `fillstyle` is set to `'none'`, the `filled` attribute should be set to `False`.

### Corrected Version:
```python
# The corrected version of the `_recache` function
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    self._filled = self._fillstyle != 'none'
    self._marker_function()
```

By updating the `_filled` attribute based on the `fillstyle` attribute of `MarkerStyle`, the corrected version ensures that markers will be hollow when the `fillstyle` is set to `'none'`.
