### Analyzing the buggy function

The `_recache` function in `markers.py` is intended to reset certain attributes to default values and then call a marker function. In this case, the function fails to correctly reset the `_filled` attribute. The failing test `test_marker_fillstyle` checks if the `fillstyle` is set to `'none'`, but due to the bug, the `_filled` attribute remains `True`, causing the test to fail.

### Potential error location

The bug lies in the assignment of the `_filled` attribute in the `_recache` function. When the `marker_function` is called, it might inadvertently reset the `_filled` attribute to `True`, contradicting the expected behavior.

### Cause of the bug

The `marker_style` object in the failing test is created with `fillstyle='none'`, which should correspond to `_filled` being set to `False`. However, the current implementation does not update `_filled`, leading to the discrepancy.

### Strategy for fixing the bug

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that setting `fillstyle` to `'none'` correctly sets `_filled` to `False` and maintains this state regardless of the `marker_function`.

### Corrected Version

```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    self._filled = False  # Corrected line
    self._marker_function()
```
