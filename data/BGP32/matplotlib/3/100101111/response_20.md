### Analysis
The buggy function `_recache` is not correctly updating the `_filled` attribute based on the fillstyle in the `MarkerStyle` object, leading to incorrect marker appearance when setting `fillstyle='none'`. This causes the failing test `test_marker_fillstyle` to not pass.

### Error Location
The bug is located in the `_recache` function where the `_filled` attribute is always set to `True` regardless of the fillstyle specified in `MarkerStyle`.

### Cause of the Bug
The cause of the bug is that the `_filled` attribute is hardcoded to `True` in the `_recache` function, leading to all markers being filled even when the fillstyle is set to `'none'`.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug
To fix the bug, the `_filled` attribute in the `_recache` function should be updated based on the fillstyle specified in the `MarkerStyle`.

### Corrected Version
Here is the corrected version of the `_recache` function:

```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    self._filled = self.get_fillstyle() != 'none'  # Update _filled based on fillstyle
    self._marker_function()
```

With this correction, the `_filled` attribute will be updated correctly based on the fillstyle specified in the `MarkerStyle` object, ensuring that markers display as hollow when `fillstyle='none'`. This fix should address the failing test and resolve the issue reported on GitHub.
