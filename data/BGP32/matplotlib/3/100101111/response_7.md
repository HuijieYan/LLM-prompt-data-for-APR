### Analysis:
The `_recache` function initializes various attributes related to the marker style but at the end calls the `self._marker_function()` without changing the `_filled` attribute. This leads to markers not being hollow when the fillstyle is set to 'none' due to the `_filled` attribute still being `True`.

### Bug Cause:
The bug arises because the `_filled` attribute remains as `True` even after setting the fillstyle to 'none'. This discrepancy causes the markers to be filled instead of hollow.

### Bug Fix:
To fix the bug, the `_filled` attribute needs to be set to `False` when the `fillstyle` is set to 'none'.

### Corrected Function:
```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    if self._fillstyle == 'none':
        self._filled = False
    else:
        self._filled = True
    self._marker_function()
```

By updating the `_recache` function as shown above, the bug causing markers to be filled when setting the `fillstyle` to 'none' is fixed. Now the expected behavior of hollow markers with 'none' fillstyle will be achieved.
