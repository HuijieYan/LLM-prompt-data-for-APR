### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_recache` resets various attributes of a `MarkerStyle` object, including `_filled` to `True` unconditionally, which contradicts the expected behavior when `fillstyle` is set to `'none'`.
2. The failing test `test_marker_fillstyle` aims to verify that `is_filled()` returns `False` when `fillstyle` is set to `'none'`, which is not the case due to the unconditional reset of `_filled` in the `_recache` function.
3. The input/output variable values and types at the time of return from the function reveal that `_filled` is always set to `True`, leading to incorrect behavior that the test detects.
4. To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the `_filled` attribute reflects the `fillstyle` setting properly.

### Bug Cause:
The bug occurs because the `_recache` function unconditionally sets `_filled` to `True`, regardless of the `fillstyle` attribute, causing the test to fail.

### Bug Fix:
To fix the bug, we need to update the `_filled` attribute to reflect the `fillstyle` setting. Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    self._filled = self._fillstyle != 'none'  # Update _filled based on fillstyle
    self._marker_function()
```

By updating the `_filled` attribute based on the `fillstyle` setting, the corrected function will now reflect the expected behavior defined by the failing test case.
