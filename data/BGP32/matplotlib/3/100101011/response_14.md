### Analysis:
The `_recache` function is meant to reset certain attributes to default values and then call a marker function. In this case, the bug seems to lie in how the `_filled` attribute is handled. The function sets `_filled` to `True` unconditionally, which contradicts the intention of setting the `fillstyle` to `'none'` in the failing test case. This inconsistency causes the markers to be filled instead of hollow as desired.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is primarily caused by setting `_filled` to `True` unconditionally, which overrides the `fillstyle` behavior requested in the failing test.

### Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, the `_filled` attribute should reflect the actual fill status based on the `fillstyle` parameter provided in the `MarkerStyle` initialization.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    self._filled = self.get_fillstyle() != 'none'
    self._marker_function()
```

With this correction, the `_filled` attribute will reflect the actual fill status based on the `fillstyle` parameter provided, allowing the markers to be hollow when desired.
