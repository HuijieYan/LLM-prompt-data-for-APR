### Analysis
The buggy function `_recache` is responsible for reinitializing certain properties of a `MarkerStyle` object. The issue arises when the `fillstyle` property is set to `'none'` but the markers are not rendered as hollow when using `ax.scatter()`. This behavior is in conflict with the expected functionality, leading to a failing test.

### Error Locations
1. The `_filled` property is set to `True`, which contradicts the intention of using `'none'` fillstyle to render hollow markers.
2. The `_marker_function()` is called without considering the specific logic needed for handling the `fillstyle` property.

### Bug Cause
The bug occurs because the `_filled` property is set to `True` by default, causing the markers to be filled despite setting the fillstyle to `'none'`. Additionally, the `_marker_function()` call does not include the necessary logic to handle the specified fillstyle, leading to incorrect marker rendering.

### Strategy for Fixing
1. Update the `_filled` property to reflect the desired hollow marker behavior when fillstyle is `'none'.
2. Adjust the `_marker_function()` call to handle the specified fillstyle and render markers accordingly.

### Corrected Version
```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    
    # Update _filled property to align with fillstyle
    if self.get_fillstyle() == 'none':
        self._filled = False
    else:
        self._filled = True
    
    self._marker_function()
``` 

By updating the `_filled` property based on the `fillstyle` specified and ensuring the `_marker_function()` handles the fillstyle correctly, the corrected version of the function should address the issue and pass the failing test.
