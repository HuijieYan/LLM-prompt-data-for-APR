## Analysis
1. The `_recache` function is designed to reset the marker properties to default values and call the `_marker_function`. 
2. In the failing test, the `MarkerStyle` instance is created with `marker='o'` and `fillstyle='none'`, and then checked for `fillstyle` and whether it is filled.
3. The issue on GitHub indicates that setting `fillstyle='none'` should result in hollow markers, but currently, that is not the case.
4. From the runtime values provided, it seems that the `_recache` function is not handling the `fillstyle` parameter correctly, leading to filled markers instead of hollow ones.

## Bug Cause
The bug is likely caused by the `_recache` function not considering the `fillstyle` attribute when resetting the marker properties. This results in the markers retaining their filled state even when `fillstyle='none'` is specified.

## Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to update the `_recache` function to include handling of the `fillstyle` attribute. If `fillstyle='none'`, the `_filled` attribute should be set to `False` to ensure the marker is hollow.

## Corrected Version
```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    self._filled = self._fillstyle != 'none'
    self._marker_function()
```

In the corrected version, we update the `_filled` attribute based on the `fillstyle` specified in the `MarkerStyle` to ensure that the marker is rendered correctly.
