### Analysis:
1. The `_recache` function is responsible for resetting various attributes when the marker style needs to be recalculated.
2. The issue seems to be related to the marker not appearing as hollow when the `fillstyle='none'` setting is used.
3. The function resets the `_filled` attribute to `True` unconditionally, which prevents the marker from appearing hollow as intended.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is caused by setting `_filled` to `True` in the `_recache` function regardless of the `fillstyle` setting. This conflicting assignment prevents the marker from displaying as hollow when `fillstyle='none'`.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to check the `fillstyle` setting in the `_recache` function and adjust the `_filled` attribute accordingly. If `fillstyle` is set to `'none'`, we should ensure that `_filled` is set to `False` to allow the marker to appear hollow.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    
    if self.get_fillstyle() == 'none':
        self._filled = False
    else:
        self._filled = True
        
    self._marker_function()
```

By adding a conditional check for the `fillstyle`, we ensure that the `_filled` attribute is set correctly based on the `fillstyle` setting. This correction will allow markers with `fillstyle='none'` to display as hollow as intended.
