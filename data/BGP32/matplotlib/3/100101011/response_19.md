### Analysis:
1. The `_recache` function is called to reset marker properties. The issue arises when setting `fillstyle='none'` to create hollow markers, but the markers still appear filled, as reported in the GitHub issue.
2. The `_marker_function` is expected to apply transformations to the marker, but it is not correctly handling the case where `fillstyle='none'`.
3. The failing test case `test_marker_fillstyle` attempts to create a MarkerStyle object with `fillstyle='none'` for an 'o' marker, but the marker is not hollow as expected due to the bug in the `_recache` function.
4. To address the bug, we need to modify the `_recache` function to correctly handle the case when `fillstyle='none'` is set in the MarkerStyle object.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is caused by the incomplete implementation of `_marker_function` related to handling `fillstyle='none'`. When `fillstyle='none'`, the markers should be hollow, but the current implementation does not account for this condition, resulting in incorrect marker appearance.

### Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to adjust the `_marker_function` logic to correctly handle the case where `fillstyle='none'`. By updating the logic to properly handle the `fillstyle`, we can ensure that markers appear hollow when the corresponding parameter is set in the MarkerStyle object.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    self._filled = self.get_fillstyle() != 'none'
    self._marker_function()
```

By updating the `_recache` function to check the `fillstyle` and set `_filled` based on whether it is `'none'` or not, we ensure that the markers will appear hollow when expected. This correction addresses the bug reported in the failing test and the GitHub issue.
