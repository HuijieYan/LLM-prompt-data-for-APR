### Explanation of the Bug
The bug is occurring because the `_recache` function in the `markers.py` file of Matplotlib library is not correctly handling the `fillstyle` attribute when setting markers. When the `fillstyle` is set to `'none'`, the markers are supposed to be hollow, but due to the incomplete implementation in the `_recache` function, the expected behavior is not achieved.

The key issue lies in the `_filled` attribute, which is not being correctly updated based on the `fillstyle` parameter. As a result, the markers are being filled even when `fillstyle` is set to `'none'`.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix this bug, we need to update the `_filled` attribute based on the `fillstyle` parameter. If `fillstyle` is set to `'none'`, then `_filled` should be set to `False` to ensure that the markers are hollow. Additionally, the function `_marker_function` should be modified to handle the `fillstyle` parameter appropriately.

### Corrected Version of the Function
```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    self._filled = self.get_fillstyle() != 'none'
    self._marker_function()
```

In this corrected version, the `_filled` attribute is updated based on the `fillstyle` parameter to ensure that markers are filled only when needed. This fix should address the bug reported in the failing test case and the GitHub issue related to markers not being hollow when `fillstyle` is set to `'none'`.
