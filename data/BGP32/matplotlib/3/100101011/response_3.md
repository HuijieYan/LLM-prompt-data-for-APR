### Analysis:
1. The `_recache` function is resetting several attributes of the MarkerStyle instance, including `_path`, `_transform`, `_snap_threshold`, `_joinstyle`, `_capstyle`, `_filled`, which might affect the appearance of markers.
2. The failing test `test_marker_fillstyle` tries to verify the `fillstyle` of a MarkerStyle object, but it fails due to the incorrect behavior of the `_recache` function.
3. The `_snap_threshold` being set to `None` might lead to issues since it should be initialized to a valid value.
4. The issue reported on GitHub suggests that setting `fillstyle='none'` is not producing hollow markers as expected when using `ax.scatter()`, which indicates that the `_filled` attribute might not be properly handled.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is caused by the `_recache` function resetting the `_filled` attribute to `True`, which results in markers being filled even when `fillstyle='none'`.

### Bug Fix:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the `_filled` attribute is correctly handled based on the `fillstyle`. We can directly set the `_filled` attribute based on the `fillstyle` parameter during marker initialization.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'

    if self.get_fillstyle() == 'none':
        self._filled = False
    else:
        self._filled = True

    self._marker_function()
``` 

By setting the `_filled` attribute based on the `fillstyle` parameter, the corrected version of the `_recache` function ensures that markers will appear hollow when `fillstyle='none'` is specified, resolving the issue and passing the failing test.
