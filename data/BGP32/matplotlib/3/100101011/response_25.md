### Analysis:
The buggy function `_recache` initializes various attributes to default values and then calls the `_marker_function`. In the failing test `test_marker_fillstyle`, an instance of `MarkerStyle` is created with the parameters `marker='o'` and `fillstyle='none'`, and then it checks if the fillstyle is 'none' and the marker is not filled.

### Error Location:
The issue seems to be with how the `_filled` attribute is being set to `True` unconditionally at the end of the `_recache` function, regardless of the actual `fillstyle` specified.

### Cause of the Bug:
The bug is causing the marker to be filled even when `fillstyle='none'` is specified, leading to unexpected behavior when rendered.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the `_filled` attribute is set based on the `fillstyle` specified in the `MarkerStyle` instance.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    self._filled = self.get_fillstyle() != 'none'  # Set _filled based on fillstyle
    self._marker_function()
```

By updating the `_filled` attribute based on the `fillstyle` specified in the `MarkerStyle` instance, we ensure that the marker is either filled or hollow as intended. This correction should make the failing test `test_marker_fillstyle` pass as expected.
