### Analysis:
The `_recache` function is intended to reset several attributes of a marker style object. The issue arises when the `self._marker_function` is called without proper initialization. This can lead to unexpected behavior when trying to set the marker style to 'none' for hollow markers.

### Error Location:
The main error in the `_recache` function lies in calling `self._marker_function` without checking if it is initialized properly. This can cause the function to fail to set the marker as hollow when 'none' fillstyle is intended.

### Cause of the Bug:
In the failing test `test_marker_fillstyle`, the `MarkerStyle` object is created with a marker of 'o' and fillstyle of 'none'. However, when the `_recache` function is called, the `_marker_function` is executed without validation, resulting in the fillstyle not being set correctly to 'none'.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the `_marker_function` is only called when it is properly initialized. This can be achieved by adding a check before executing the function.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function and callable(self._marker_function):
        self._path = _empty_path
        self._transform = IdentityTransform()
        self._alt_path = None
        self._alt_transform = None
        self._snap_threshold = None
        self._joinstyle = 'round'
        self._capstyle = 'butt'
        self._filled = True
        self._marker_function()
```

In this corrected version, we check if `self._marker_function` exists and is callable before executing it. This ensures that the marker style attributes are reset only when `_marker_function` is intended to be executed. After making this change, the `MarkerStyle` object should correctly reflect the 'none' fillstyle for hollow markers.
