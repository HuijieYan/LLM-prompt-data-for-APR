### Potential error locations within the buggy function
1. The `_recache` function checks if `_marker_function` is `None` before executing the function, but it doesn't consider the case where `_marker_function` is not `None` but may be incorrect.
2. The function sets `_filled` to `True` unconditionally, which may override the desired setting when creating a custom marker style with `fillstyle='none'`.

### Explanation of the bug
- The provided test `test_marker_fillstyle` aims to create a custom marker style with `fillstyle='none'`, but the buggy function `_recache` unconditionally sets `_filled` to `True`, regardless of the fillstyle setting. This results in the markers not being hollow as expected in the test.
- The GitHub issue reflects a similar scenario where the user tries to create hollow markers but doesn't achieve the desired result using `fillstyle='none'`.

### Strategy for fixing the bug
1. Update the `_filled` attribute based on the `fillstyle` value to ensure that when `fillstyle='none'`, the marker is hollow.
2. Check the validity of `_marker_function` before calling it to prevent unintended behavior.

### Corrected version of the function
```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    if self.get_fillstyle() == 'none':
        self._filled = False
    else:
        self._filled = True
    self._marker_function()
```

By adding a conditional check based on the fillstyle value to determine the `_filled` attribute's setting, the corrected version of the function ensures that setting `fillstyle='none'` results in hollow markers as intended.
