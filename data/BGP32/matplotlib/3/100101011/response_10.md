### Bug Analysis:
The buggy function `_recache` is meant to reset certain attributes to default values if the `_marker_function` is not None and then call the `_marker_function`. However, the issue is arising from the fact that even if `fillstyle='none'` is set for the marker style, the `_filled` attribute is explicitly set to `True`. This causes the markers to be filled instead of hollow.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to update the `_filled` attribute based on the fillstyle specified in the marker style. If the fillstyle is set to 'full', `_filled` should be `True`, and if it is set to 'none', `_filled` should be `False`.

### Corrected Version of the Buggy Function:
```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    self._filled = self._fillstyle != 'none'  # Update _filled based on fillstyle
    self._marker_function()
```

After making this adjustment, the markers will correctly reflect the specified fillstyle 'none' when creating custom MarkerStyle objects, resolving the issue reported in the GitHub thread.
