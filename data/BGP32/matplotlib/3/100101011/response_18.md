### Analysis:
- The `_recache` function is called when certain properties of the marker need to be recalculated.
- The issue arises when setting `fillstyle='none'` for a marker, but the marker remains filled when using `ax.scatter()`.

### Potential Error Locations:
1. The assignment of `_filled = True` could be the reason for markers appearing filled even when `fillstyle='none'` is set.
2. The `_marker_function` might not handle the logic for rendering markers with different fill styles correctly.

### Bug Cause:
The `_filled = True` assignment is overriding the desired `fillstyle='none'` setting, causing the markers to appear filled.

### Fix Strategy:
- Update the `_filled` attribute based on the fill style set in the `MarkerStyle`.
- Ensure that the `_marker_function` handles rendering markers with different fill styles correctly.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    self._filled = self._fillstyle != 'none'
    self._marker_function()
```

In this corrected version, the `_filled` attribute is set based on the fill style specified in the `MarkerStyle`. This change ensures that markers will render correctly as either filled or hollow based on the `fillstyle` parameter.
