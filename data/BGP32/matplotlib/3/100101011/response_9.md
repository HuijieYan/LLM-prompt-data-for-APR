### Analysis:
1. The `_recache` function is responsible for resetting several attributes to default values and calling the `_marker_function`. In the failing test, the issue lies in the `fillstyle` not being correctly set to `'none'`.
   
2. The current implementation of `_recache` does not handle setting the `fillstyle` property correctly, resulting in the markers not being hollow as expected.

### Bug Cause:
The `_recache` function does not update the `fillstyle` attribute, which leads to the markers not being hollow when the `fillstyle` is set to `'none'`.

### Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the `fillstyle` attribute is appropriately set in the `_recache` function. This can be achieved by updating the function to include handling of the `fillstyle` property.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    self._filled = True
    self._fillstyle = 'none'  # Add setting of fillstyle attribute
    self._marker_function()
```

By adding the line `self._fillstyle = 'none'` in the `_recache` function, the fillstyle attribute will be correctly set to `'none' when the function is called, addressing the issue with markers not being hollow when using `fillstyle='none'`.
