The bug in the `_recache` function is that it resets the `_filled` attribute to `True` regardless of the `fillstyle` being set to `'none'`. This causes markers to not appear hollow when the `fillstyle` is set to `'none'`.

To fix this bug, we need to update the `_filled` attribute based on the `fillstyle` parameter. If `fillstyle` is set to `'none'`, then `_filled` should be set to `False`.

Here is the corrected version of the `_recache` function:

```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    
    # Update _filled based on fillstyle
    if self.get_fillstyle() == 'none':
        self._filled = False
    else:
        self._filled = True
    
    self._marker_function()
```

With this correction, the `MarkerStyle` will correctly display as hollow when the `fillstyle` is set to `'none'`. This addresses the issue reported on GitHub and resolves the failing test case.
