### Analysis:
1. The `_recache` function in `markers.py` is responsible for re-initializing certain attributes related to markers in Matplotlib.
2. The failing test `test_marker_fillstyle` checks if a marker with `fillstyle='none'` is correctly identified as unfilled.
3. In Case 1, the variables mentioned indicate that the function is not correctly handling the `fillstyle` attribute, leading to incorrect marker filling behavior.

### Bug Explanation:
The bug originates from the incomplete implementation of handling the `fillstyle` attribute within the `_recache` function. The current implementation does not consider setting the `fillstyle` attribute, which results in the markers being filled by default, contrary to the expected behavior set by the user in the failing test.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Update the `_recache` function to consider the `fillstyle` attribute and adjust the filling behavior accordingly.
2. Since the failing test expects an unfilled marker, the `_filled` attribute should be updated based on the given `fillstyle`.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    if self._fillstyle == 'none':
        self._filled = False
    else:
        self._filled = True
    self._marker_function()
```

By adding a condition to update the `_filled` attribute based on the `fillstyle`, the corrected version ensures that the markers are correctly identified as filled or unfilled as per the user's input.
