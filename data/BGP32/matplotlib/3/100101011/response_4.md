### Analysis:
The buggy function `_recache` in the `markers.py` file is intended to reset various attributes to default values and execute the `_marker_function`. However, the issue lies in the fact that the `_marker_function` is called without considering if it exists or not, leading to potential errors.

### Identified bug:
The bug arises from the unconditional call to `_marker_function` without checking if it has been defined or not. This causes unexpected behavior when certain marker styles, such as 'none' for fillstyle, are attempted to be set.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Check if `_marker_function` exists before calling it to avoid errors.
2. Include a conditional check to see if `_marker_function` is not None before executing it.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    self._filled = True
    if callable(self._marker_function):
        self._marker_function()
``` 

### Updated buggy function with the bug fix:
The corrected version of the `_recache` function includes a check to ensure that `_marker_function` exists and is callable before executing it, preventing potential errors when customized marker styles are used.

By applying this fix, the issue reported on GitHub regarding markers not being hollow when using `ax.scatter()` and setting `markers.MarkerStyle()`'s fillstyle to 'none' should be resolved.
