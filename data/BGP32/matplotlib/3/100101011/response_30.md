### Analysis:
- The `_recache` function is meant to reset certain attributes of a marker style instance.
- The issue seems to be related to the `fillstyle`, which should be set to `'none'` to make markers hollow.
- The failing test `test_marker_fillstyle` expects the `fillstyle` to be set to `'none'`.

### Error Location:
The buggy function is setting `_filled` to `True` unconditionally, which contradicts the expected behavior of having hollow markers with `fillstyle='none'`.

### Bug Explanation:
The bug occurs because the `_filled` attribute is set to `True` by default in the `_recache` function, even though the `fillstyle` is meant to be set to `'none'` to have hollow markers. This leads to the markers not appearing as hollow as expected by the test.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To address this issue, we need to update the `_recache` function to check the `fillstyle` and set `_filled` accordingly. If `fillstyle` is `'none'`, then `_filled` should be set to `False` to ensure the markers are hollow.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    self._filled = False if self.get_fillstyle() == 'none' else True
    self._marker_function()
```

By updating the `_recache` function to set `_filled` based on the `fillstyle`, we ensure that the markers' appearance aligns with the expected behavior in the failing test case. This correction should resolve the issue reported on GitHub as well.
