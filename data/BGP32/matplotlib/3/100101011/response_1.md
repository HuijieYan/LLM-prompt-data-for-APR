### Analysis:
- The `_recache` function initializes various attributes to default values and then calls the `_marker_function`. The issue might be related to the default values being set incorrectly before calling the function.
- The failing test `test_marker_fillstyle` creates a `MarkerStyle` instance with `fillstyle='none'`, expecting it to return 'none' as the fillstyle.
- The provided runtime values before the function's return show that the `_filled` attribute is set to `True`, which contradicts the expected behavior based on the failing test.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is likely caused by setting `_filled` to `True` unconditionally within the `_recache` function, overriding the `fillstyle` specified in the `MarkerStyle` instance. This leads to the markers not appearing as hollow as expected.

### Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we should ensure that the `_filled` attribute reflects the `fillstyle` set in the `MarkerStyle` instance. If the `fillstyle` is 'none', `_filled` should be set to `False` to achieve the desired hollow marker appearance.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    self._filled = self.get_fillstyle() != 'none'
    self._marker_function()
```

By modifying the `_filled` attribute based on the `fillstyle` specified in the `MarkerStyle` instance, the corrected version of the function ensures that hollow markers work correctly when using `fillstyle='none'. This change should address the issue reported in the GitHub thread and make the failing test `test_marker_fillstyle` pass successfully.
