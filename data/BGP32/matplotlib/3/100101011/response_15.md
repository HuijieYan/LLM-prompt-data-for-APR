### Analysis:
1. The `_recache` function in the `markers.py` file sets various attributes to default values and then calls a `_marker_function`. However, it doesn't handle the case when the `_marker_function` is provided but not executed correctly.
   
2. The failing test `test_marker_fillstyle` creates a `MarkerStyle` object with a specific marker and fillstyle, then checks if the fillstyle is retrieved correctly. The issue seems to be related to the fillstyle not being set as expected.

3. Looking at Case 1 runtime values, it seems like the `_filled` attribute is being set to `True` regardless of the fillstyle being 'none', which suggests that the expected hollow markers are not being rendered.

### Bug Cause:
The bug likely exists because the `_filled` attribute is hardcoded to `True` in the `_recache` function, which overrides the fillstyle set by the user and results in filled markers instead of hollow.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the `_filled` attribute is set based on the fillstyle provided by the user when creating a `MarkerStyle` object. This can be done by updating the `_recache` function to consider the fillstyle parameter.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    
    if self.get_fillstyle() == 'none':  # Check if fillstyle is set to 'none'
        self._filled = False  # Set filled to False for hollow markers
    else:
        self._filled = True  # Default to True if fillstyle is not 'none'
        
    self._marker_function()  # Call the marker function
```

With this correction, the `_recache` function will now respect the user-defined fillstyle and set the `_filled` attribute accordingly, ensuring that the markers will render as expected based on the fillstyle parameter provided during object creation.
