The bug in the `_recache` function lies in the inappropriate execution of `_marker_function` without considering the case where `self._marker_function` is `None`. This can lead to potential errors when calling a function that is not defined.

To fix this bug, we need to add a check to ensure that `self._marker_function` is not `None` before calling it. If `self._marker_function` is `None`, we should simply return from the function without executing further operations.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = float('inf')
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    self._filled = False
    self._marker_function()
```

With this correction, the function will only execute `_marker_function` if it is not `None`, ensuring the proper behavior of the function based on the expected input/output values provided.
