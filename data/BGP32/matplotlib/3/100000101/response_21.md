The bug in the provided function is that after setting `self._filled` to `True`, it immediately calls `self._marker_function()` without updating any other variables. This leads to inconsistent behavior and potential errors, especially when `self._filled` is expected to be `False` in one of the test cases.

To fix this bug, I suggest updating the variables before calling `self._marker_function()`. Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = float('inf')
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    self._filled = False
    
    self._marker_function()
```

By setting `self._filled` to `False` before calling `self._marker_function()`, we ensure that the expected values are correctly set before any further operations are executed within the function. This correction aligns with the expected input/output values provided for the test cases.
