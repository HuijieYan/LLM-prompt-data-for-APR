The bug in the provided function is that it is trying to call a `_marker_function` without checking if it exists. This can lead to an AttributeError if `_marker_function` is not defined. To fix this bug, we need to check if `_marker_function` is not None before calling it.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is not None:
        self._path = _empty_path
        self._transform = IdentityTransform()
        self._alt_path = None
        self._alt_transform = None
        self._snap_threshold = float('inf')
        self._joinstyle = 'round'
        self._capstyle = 'butt'
        self._filled = False
        self._marker_function()
```

The corrected function first checks if `_marker_function` is not None before setting the internal variables and calling the function. This fix ensures that the function won't encounter an AttributeError when calling `_marker_function` if it is not defined.

This corrected function satisfies all the expected input/output values for the test cases provided.
