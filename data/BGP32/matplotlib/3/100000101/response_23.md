The bug in the provided function is that it calls `self._marker_function()` without any conditional checks, which can lead to errors if `self._marker_function` is not defined. 

To fix the bug, we need to add a check to ensure that `self._marker_function` is not `None` before calling it.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: lib/matplotlib/markers.py

def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is not None:
        self._path = _empty_path
        self._transform = IdentityTransform()
        self._alt_path = None
        self._alt_transform = None
        self._snap_threshold = float('inf')
        self._joinstyle = 'round'
        self._capstyle = 'butt'
        self._filled = False
        self._marker_function()
```

With this correction, the function will only call `self._marker_function()` if it is defined, preventing any potential errors. The rest of the function remains the same as expected with the given input/output values and types.
