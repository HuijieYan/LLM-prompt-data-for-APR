The buggy function `_recache` is supposed to reset various attributes to default values before calling the `_marker_function`. However, there is a bug in the function where it incorrectly sets the `_filled` attribute to `True` instead of `False`. This causes a discrepancy in the expected values of the `_filled` attribute in the failing test cases.

To fix this bug, we need to update the assignment of the `_filled` attribute to set it to `False` as expected.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    self._filled = False
    self._marker_function()
```

With this correction, the `_filled` attribute will be correctly set to `False` as expected in the failing test cases.
