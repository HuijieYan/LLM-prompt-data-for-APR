The bug in the `_recache` function lies in the incorrect assignment of variables and the missing initialization of `_marker_function`. The function is supposed to reset certain internal variables to their default values and then call `_marker_function`, but it mistakenly sets `_filled` to `True` instead of `False` as expected.

To fix this bug, we need to correct the assignment of `_filled` and properly initialize `_marker_function` to ensure it is callable.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: lib/matplotlib/markers.py

def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = float('inf')
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    self._filled = False
    if self._marker_function:
        self._marker_function()
```

This corrected version ensures that `_filled` is set to `False` and checks if `_marker_function` is callable before invoking it. These changes align with the expected input/output values provided for the failing test execution cases.
