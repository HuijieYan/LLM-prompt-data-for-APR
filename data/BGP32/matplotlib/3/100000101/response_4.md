The buggy function `_recache` is setting some variables to predefined values and then calling a marker function without checking if it exists, which could lead to an error if the function is not defined.

To fix this bug, we should add a condition to check if `self._marker_function` is not `None` before calling it.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is not None:
        self._path = _empty_path
        self._transform = IdentityTransform()
        self._alt_path = None
        self._alt_transform = None
        self._snap_threshold = float('inf')
        self._joinstyle = 'round'
        self._capstyle = 'butt'
        self._filled = False
        self._marker_function()
```

This corrected version checks if `self._marker_function` is not `None` before executing it. This way, it prevents any potential errors that could occur if the function is not defined.
