The bug in the `_recache` function is that it tries to call `self._marker_function` without checking if it is defined. This can lead to an error if `_marker_function` is not assigned in the object. 

To fix this bug, we need to add a check to see if `self._marker_function` is not None before calling it.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is not None:
        self._path = _empty_path
        self._transform = IdentityTransform()
        self._alt_path = None
        self._alt_transform = None
        self._snap_threshold = float('inf')
        self._joinstyle = 'round'
        self._capstyle = 'butt'
        self._filled = False
        self._marker_function()
```

This corrected version includes the check for `self._marker_function` before calling it to avoid any potential errors. It also sets the expected values for the variables as described in the test cases.
