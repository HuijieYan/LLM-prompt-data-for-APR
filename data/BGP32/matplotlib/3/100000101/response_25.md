The bug in the `_recache` function is that it calls `self._marker_function()` without checking if it exists. This can lead to errors if `_marker_function` is not defined. 

To fix this bug, we should first check if `self._marker_function` is not None before calling it.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is not None:
        self._path = _empty_path
        self._transform = IdentityTransform()
        self._alt_path = None
        self._alt_transform = None
        self._snap_threshold = float('inf')
        self._joinstyle = 'round'
        self._capstyle = 'butt'
        self._filled = False
        self._marker_function()
```

This fixed version of the function ensures that `_marker_function` is only called if it is not None, addressing the bug in the original implementation.
