The buggy function `_recache` is intended to reset certain attributes to their default values and then call the `_marker_function` if it is not `None`. 

The bug in the function is that it sets `self._filled` to `True` unconditionally, rather than based on the conditions of the expected cases. 

To fix this bug, we need to set `self._filled` to `False` if `self._fillstyle` is `'none'`.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    self._filled = self._fillstyle != 'none'
    self._marker_function()
```

With this correction, the function checks `self._fillstyle` before setting `self._filled`, making sure it aligns with the expected values in the test cases. This will ensure that the function behaves correctly in all scenarios specified.
