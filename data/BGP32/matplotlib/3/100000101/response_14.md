The bug in the given function is that the `_marker_function()` is called without checking if it exists, which could lead to a AttributeError if `_marker_function` is None. 

To fix this bug, we can add a check before calling `_marker_function()` to ensure it is not None.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is not None:
        self._path = _empty_path
        self._transform = IdentityTransform()
        self._alt_path = None
        self._alt_transform = None
        self._snap_threshold = float('inf')
        self._joinstyle = 'round'
        self._capstyle = 'butt'
        self._filled = False
        self._marker_function()
```


This correction ensures that `_marker_function()` is only called when it is not None, preventing any AttributeError from occurring.
