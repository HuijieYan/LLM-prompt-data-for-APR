The bug in the provided function is that the `_marker_function` is being called even when `self._marker_function` is `None`. This can cause an error as the function being called is not defined.

To fix this bug, we need to add a check before calling `_marker_function` to ensure that it is not `None`.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = float('inf')
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    self._filled = False
    self._marker_function()
```

This corrected version addresses the bug by adding a check to only call `_marker_function` if it is not `None`. Additionally, I changed the initialization of `_snap_threshold` to `float('inf')` to represent infinity as a float value. Finally, I set `_filled` to `False` as per the expected values and types mentioned in the test cases.
