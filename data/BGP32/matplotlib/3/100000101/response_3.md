The bug in the provided function `_recache` is that it is calling `self._marker_function()` without checking if `self._marker_function` is actually defined or not. This can lead to a `TypeError` if `_marker_function` is `None`.

To fix this bug, we need to add a condition to check if `self._marker_function` is not `None` before calling it.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: lib/matplotlib/markers.py

def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is not None:
        self._path = _empty_path
        self._transform = IdentityTransform()
        self._alt_path = None
        self._alt_transform = None
        self._snap_threshold = float('inf')
        self._joinstyle = 'round'
        self._capstyle = 'butt'
        self._filled = False
        self._marker_function()
```

By adding the condition `if self._marker_function is not None:` before calling `self._marker_function()`, we ensure that the function is only called if it exists and avoids a `TypeError`.

This corrected version should now satisfy the expected input/output values for both cases provided.
