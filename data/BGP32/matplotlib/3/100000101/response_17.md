### Analysis
The buggy function `_recache` is supposed to reset certain internal variables to their initial values and then call a `_marker_function`. However, the issue lies in the initialization of `self._filled` to `True` instead of `False` as expected in the second case.

### Bug
The bug is in setting `self._filled = True` instead of `self._filled = False`, which does not match the expected output for the second case.

### Fix
Change the initialization of `self._filled` to `False` to match the expected output values.

### Corrected Version

```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    self._filled = False
    self._marker_function()
```
