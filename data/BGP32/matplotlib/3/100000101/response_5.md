The bug in the `_recache` function lies in the line where `_filled` is set to `True` instead of `False` as indicated by the expected output values. Additionally, the function being called `self._marker_function()` should be executed if it exists.

To fix the bug, we need to change the assignment of `_filled` to `False` and only call `self._marker_function()` if it is not None.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = float('inf')
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    self._filled = False
    self._marker_function()
```

With these changes, the function should now behave as expected according to the specified test cases.
