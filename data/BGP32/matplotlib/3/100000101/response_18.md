The bug in the `_recache` function lies in setting the `_filled` variable to `True` unconditionally instead of setting it to `False`. This results in the incorrect behavior where `_filled` is always set to `True` regardless of the input value of `self._fillstyle`.

To fix this bug, we need to ensure that `_filled` is set to `False` if `self._fillstyle` is `'none'`. 

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    self._filled = False if self._fillstyle == 'none' else True # Fix here
    self._marker_function()
```

This correction ensures that the `_filled` variable is set based on the value of `self._fillstyle` as expected in the test cases.
