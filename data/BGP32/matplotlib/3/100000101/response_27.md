The buggy function `_recache` is setting the `_filled` variable to `True` unconditionally, disregarding the expected input value of `'none'` for `self._fillstyle`. This is likely causing incorrect behavior when the function is called with different fillstyles. 

To fix the bug, we need to adjust the setting of `_filled` based on the input parameter `self._fillstyle`. If `self._fillstyle` is `'none'`, then `_filled` should be set to `False`. If `self._fillstyle` is not `'none'`, then `_filled` can be set to `True`.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    self._filled = self._fillstyle != 'none'  # Adjusting _filled based on fillstyle
    self._marker_function()
```

By making this adjustment, the function will correctly set `_filled` according to the expected input value of `self._fillstyle`. This should prevent the incorrect behavior seen when `_filled` was unconditionally set to `True`.
