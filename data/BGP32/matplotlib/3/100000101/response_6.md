The bug in the provided function `_recache` is that it is invoking `self._marker_function()` without checking if it exists. This can lead to potential errors if `_marker_function` is not defined or is of the wrong type.

To fix this bug, we need to ensure that `_marker_function` exists and is callable before invoking it.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is not None and callable(self._marker_function):
        self._path = _empty_path
        self._transform = IdentityTransform()
        self._alt_path = None
        self._alt_transform = None
        self._snap_threshold = float('inf')
        self._joinstyle = 'round'
        self._capstyle = 'butt'
        self._filled = False
        self._marker_function()
    else:
        # handle the case where _marker_function is not defined or not callable
        pass
```

By adding the check `if self._marker_function is not None and callable(self._marker_function):`, we ensure that `_marker_function` exists and is a callable function before calling it. Additionally, I have corrected the setting of `_filled` from `True` to `False` as per the expected values.

This corrected version should satisfy the expected input/output values for both cases.
