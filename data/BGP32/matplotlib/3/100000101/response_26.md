The bug in the provided function `_recache` is that it sets `_filled` to `True` unconditionally instead of setting it to `False` as specified in the expected values. 

### Bug explanation:
The bug causes `_filled` to be set to `True`, irrespective of the expected value of `False`. This affects the behavior of the function and does not align with the expected output for the variable.

### Strategy for fixing the bug:
To fix the bug, we need to update the assignment of `_filled` to `False` as expected, instead of assigning it to `True` unconditionally.

### Corrected version of the function:

```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = float('inf')
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    self._filled = False
    self._marker_function()
``` 

By updating the assignment of `_filled` to `False`, the function now aligns with the expected behavior specified in the test cases.
