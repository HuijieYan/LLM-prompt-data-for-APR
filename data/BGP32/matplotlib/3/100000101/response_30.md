Based on the buggy function, it seems that the `_marker_function` is being called without checking if it is actually defined. This can lead to errors if the function is not set correctly.

To fix this issue, we can check if `_marker_function` is not None before calling it.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: lib/matplotlib/markers.py

def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is not None:
        self._path = _empty_path
        self._transform = IdentityTransform()
        self._alt_path = None
        self._alt_transform = None
        self._snap_threshold = None
        self._joinstyle = 'round'
        self._capstyle = 'butt'
        self._filled = True
        self._marker_function()
```

By adding the check `if self._marker_function is not None:`, we ensure that the `_marker_function` is only called if it exists, avoiding any potential errors related to calling a non-existent function.

This corrected version should now satisfy the expected input/output values for the provided test cases.
