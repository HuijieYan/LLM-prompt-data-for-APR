### Analysis:
The buggy function `_recache` is called to reset various attributes when needed. In the provided code snippet, the function sets `_filled` to `True` right before calling `_marker_function()`, which may contradict the expected behavior of having hollow markers with `fillstyle='none'`.

### Bug Cause:
The bug arises due to resetting the `_filled` attribute to `True` regardless of the `fillstyle` set to 'none', which leads to filled markers instead of hollow markers.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the `_filled` attribute is set according to the `fillstyle` provided. It should only be set to `True` if the `fillstyle` is not 'none'.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    
    if self._fillstyle == 'none':
        self._filled = False
    else:
        self._filled = True
    
    self._marker_function()
```

In the corrected version, the `_filled` attribute is set based on the `fillstyle` value provided. If `fillstyle` is 'none', `_filled` is set to `False`, ensuring hollow markers when appropriate.
