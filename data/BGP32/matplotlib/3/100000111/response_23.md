**Analysis:**
The buggy function `_recache` sets several attributes to default values and then calls a function `_marker_function` if it is not `None`.

**Identified Error:** 
In expected case 1 and case 2, the expected value for `_filled` is `False`, but the function is setting it to `True`. This contradicts the expected behavior of having hollow markers when `fillstyle` is set to `'none'`.

**Bug Cause:** 
The bug occurs because the function sets `_filled` to `True` unconditionally, leading to filled markers even when `fillstyle` is set to `'none'`. This behavior does not match the user's expectation of having hollow markers.

**Strategy for Fixing the Bug:**
To fix the bug, the `_filled` attribute needs to be set based on the value of `self._fillstyle`. If `self._fillstyle` is `'none'`, then `_filled` should be `False`, indicating hollow markers.

**Corrected Version of the Function:**
```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    self._filled = self._fillstyle.lower() != 'none'  # Set _filled based on fillstyle
    self._marker_function()
```

By updating the function to set `_filled` based on the value of `self._fillstyle`, the corrected version should now produce the expected behavior of having hollow markers when `fillstyle` is set to `'none'`.
