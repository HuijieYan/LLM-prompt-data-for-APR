The buggy function `_recache` is supposed to reset certain attributes to default values when the `self._marker_function` is not `None`. However, the issue arises when the `self._fillstyle` is set to `'none'`, and the intended behavior is for the markers to be hollow. The bug is likely caused by the setting of `_filled` to `True` at the end of the function, conflicting with the intention to have hollow markers.

To fix this bug, we should update the `_filled` attribute based on the `self._fillstyle` parameter to ensure that when `fillstyle` is `'none'`, the markers are indeed hollow. We can modify the `_recache` function to adjust the `_filled` attribute accordingly.

Here is the corrected version of the `_recache` function:

```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    # Adjust _filled based on the fillstyle parameter
    if self._fillstyle == 'none':
        self._filled = False
    else:
        self._filled = True
    self._marker_function()
```

By updating the `_filled` attribute based on the `self._fillstyle` parameter, the corrected function should now correctly handle the case when `fillstyle` is set to `'none'`, ensuring that the markers are hollow as expected.
