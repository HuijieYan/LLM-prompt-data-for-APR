### Analysis:
The provided buggy function `_recache` is intended to reset various attributes of a marker instance to prepare it for the cache update. However, the issue arises when the `self._filled` attribute is always set to `True` regardless of the provided `self._fillstyle` parameter. This inconsistency leads to markers not appearing hollow when `self._fillstyle` is set to `'none'`. 

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix this bug, the `_filled` attribute should be set based on the value of the `self._fillstyle` parameter. If the `self._fillstyle` is set to `'none'`, then `_filled` should be set to `False` to ensure the marker appears hollow as intended.

### Corrected Function:
```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    self._filled = (self._fillstyle != 'none')
    self._marker_function()
``` 

By updating the `_filled` attribute based on the value of `self._fillstyle`, the corrected function ensures that the markers will appear hollow when `self._fillstyle` is set to `'none'`, resolving the issue posted on GitHub.
