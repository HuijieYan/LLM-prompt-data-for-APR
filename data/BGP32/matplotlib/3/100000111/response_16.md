The buggy function `_recache` is not correctly handling the case when `self._marker_function` is not None. It should reassign all the attributes like `_path`, `_transform`, `_alt_path`, etc., regardless of the marker function being present or not.

The bug causes the function to not reset the attributes to their default values when the marker function is not None, leading to unexpected behavior when the function is called in certain contexts.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the `_recache` function to properly reset all attributes in all scenarios. We can do this by removing the initial check for `self._marker_function is None` and always reassigning all attributes.

Here is the corrected version of the `_recache` function:

```python
def _recache(self):
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    self._filled = True
    self._marker_function()
```

This corrected version ensures that all attributes are reset to their default values regardless of the presence of `self._marker_function`, addressing the bug and aligning the function with the expected behavior specified in the GitHub issue.
