The bug in the provided `_recache` function is that it sets self._filled to True unconditionally, regardless of the value of `self._fillstyle`. This leads to markers not being hollow when the `fillstyle` is set to 'none', as reported in the GitHub issue.

To fix this bug, we should update the `_recache` function to consider the value of `self._fillstyle` when setting the `_filled` attribute. If `self._fillstyle` is 'none', then `_filled` should be set to False.

Here is the corrected version of the `_recache` function:

```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    self._filled = self._fillstyle != 'none'  # Updated line
    self._marker_function()
```

This modification ensures that the `self._filled` attribute is set to False when `self._fillstyle` is 'none', allowing markers to be hollow as expected.
