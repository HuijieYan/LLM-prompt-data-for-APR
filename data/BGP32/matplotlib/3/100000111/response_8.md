The bug in the `_recache` function is that it sets the `_filled` attribute to `True` unconditionally, overriding any intended value. This causes markers to be filled even when the `fillstyle` is set to `'none'`.

To fix this bug, we need to update the `_filled` attribute based on the `fillstyle` value. If `fillstyle` is `'none'`, `_filled` should be set to `False`, otherwise, it should be set to `True`.

Here is the corrected version of the `_recache` function:

```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
        
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    
    # Update filled attribute based on fillstyle
    if self._fillstyle == 'none':
        self._filled = False
    else:
        self._filled = True

    self._marker_function()
```

With this correction, the `filled` attribute will be correctly set based on the `fillstyle` value, allowing markers to be hollow when `fillstyle` is set to `'none'. This fix addresses the issue reported on GitHub where markers were not hollow even when `fillstyle` was set to `'none'`.
