## Analysis
The buggy function `_recache` is responsible for resetting certain attributes of a marker style object. Based on the expected input/output values and the GitHub issue, the bug seems to arise from the incorrect handling of the `_filled` attribute. The expected behavior is to set `_filled` to `False` when `self._fillstyle` is `'none'`.

## Bug Cause
The bug occurs because the `_filled` attribute is always set to `True` regardless of the value of `self._fillstyle`. This causes markers to be filled even when the `fillstyle` is set to `'none' as described in the GitHub issue.

## Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to update the `_filled` attribute based on the `self._fillstyle` parameter.

## Code Fix
```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    self._filled = True if self._fillstyle != 'none' else False
    self._marker_function()
```

By updating the `_filled` attribute based on the `self._fillstyle` parameter, the corrected function now ensures that markers are filled correctly according to the specified fillstyle.
