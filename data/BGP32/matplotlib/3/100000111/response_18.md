## Analysis
The buggy function `_recache` is meant to reset certain properties of a MarkerStyle object to their default values. The bug arises in the line `self._marker_function()` at the end of the function, as it seems to be invoking a function that might not exist or is not correctly set, leading to unexpected behavior.

## Bug Cause
The `_marker_function()` call at the end of `_recache` is unnecessary if `self._marker_function` is None, which is initialized as such in the buggy function. This call may be triggering an error or altering the expected behavior.

## Fix Strategy
1. Remove the unnecessary `_marker_function()` call.
2. Keep the other properties reset as intended.

## Corrected Version
```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = float('inf')  # Set snap_threshold to infinity
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    self._filled = False  # Set filled to False
```
