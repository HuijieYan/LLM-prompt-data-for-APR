The bug in the `_recache` function is that it calls the `_marker_function` without updating the necessary properties before calling it. This leads to unexpected behavior when trying to set markers as hollow.

To fix this issue, we need to ensure that the properties are set correctly before invoking the `_marker_function`. We need to update the properties `self._filled` and `self._marker_function`.

Here is the corrected version of the `_recache` function:

```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = Path(verts=[])  # Assuming that `_empty_path` is a Path object with no data
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = np.inf  # Importing numpy for infinity value
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    self._filled = False  # Setting the default filled value to False
    self._marker_function()
``` 

This corrected version sets `self._filled` to `False` before executing `_marker_function`, ensuring that markers will be hollow when `fillstyle='none'` is specified in the calling code.
