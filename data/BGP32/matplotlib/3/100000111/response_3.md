The issue is related to the fact that when using `ax.scatter()` and setting `fillstyle='none'` in `markers.MarkerStyle()`, the markers are not rendered as hollow as expected. This is due to the setting of `self._filled = True` in the `_recache` function of markers.py within Matplotlib.

To fix the issue, we need to update the `_recache` function so that `self._filled` is set to `False` when `self._fillstyle` is set to `'none'`.

Here is the corrected version of the `_recache` function:

```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    if self._fillstyle == 'none':  # Check if fillstyle is 'none'
        self._filled = False  # Set _filled to False when fillstyle is 'none'
    else:
        self._filled = True  # Default behavior
    self._marker_function()
```

By updating the `_recache` function as shown above, the markers will be rendered as hollow when the fillstyle is set to `'none'` as described in the scenario provided in the GitHub issue.
