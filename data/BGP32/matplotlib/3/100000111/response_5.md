### Analysis:
In the provided buggy function `_recache`, the code always calls `self._marker_function()` regardless of the value of `self._marker_function`. This can lead to unintended behavior, especially if `self._marker_function` is `None`. In the context of the given GitHub issue, setting `fillstyle='none'` does not make the markers hollow, indicating a potential bug in the `_recache` function associated with how marker styles are handled.

### Bug Cause:
The bug occurs because the `_recache` function does not handle the case where `self._marker_function` is `None`, leading to inappropriate marker styling behavior.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To address this bug, we need to add a condition to check if `self._marker_function` is not `None` before calling it within the `_recache` function.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return

    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    self._filled = True

    if self._fillstyle == 'none':
        self._filled = False  # Making markers hollow

    self._marker_function()
```

In the corrected version, we added a condition to set `self._filled` to False when `self._fillstyle` is `'none'`, ensuring that markers will be displayed as hollow when this style is selected. This change aligns with the expectation based on the provided GitHub issue.

By incorporating this fix, the `_recache` function now correctly handles the scenario where markers should be rendered as hollow based on the specified marker style.
