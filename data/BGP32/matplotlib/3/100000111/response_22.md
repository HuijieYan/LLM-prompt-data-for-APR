## Analysis:
The buggy function `_recache` is intended to reset various attributes of a marker class instance. However, the issue arises when attempting to set the `fillstyle` attribute to `'none'`, causing the markers to not appear hollow as expected.

## Identified Error:
The buggy function `_recache` fails to properly handle the setting of the `fillstyle` attribute to `'none'`. This causes the markers to be filled instead of hollow.

## Bug Cause:
The bug occurs because the function sets the `_filled` attribute to `True` unconditionally after resetting attributes, regardless of the desired `fillstyle`. This leads to the markers being filled instead of appearing hollow.

## Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to conditionally set the `_filled` attribute based on the value of `self._fillstyle`. If `self._fillstyle` is `'none'`, then `_filled` should be set to `False` to achieve the desired hollow marker appearance.

## The Corrected Function:
```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    if self._fillstyle == 'none':
        self._filled = False
    else:
        self._filled = True
    self._marker_function()
``` 

By adding the conditional check for `self._fillstyle` and setting `_filled` accordingly, the corrected function now properly handles the case when a hollow marker is desired.
