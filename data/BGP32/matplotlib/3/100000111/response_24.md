### Analysis:
The buggy function `_recache` is supposed to reset various attributes to default values before calling `_marker_function`. However, there is a mistake in setting the `self._filled` attribute. It should be set to `False` instead of `True` to correctly indicate if the marker should be filled or not.

### Bug Cause:
The bug causes the markers to be filled even when the `fillstyle` is set to `'none'`, as reported in the GitHub issue. It happens because the `self._filled` attribute is always set to `True`, leading to filled markers regardless of the specified `fillstyle`.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, the `self._filled` attribute should be set to `False` instead of `True` in the `_recache` function. This change will respect the `fillstyle='none'` setting and prevent the markers from being filled.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    self._filled = False  # Corrected attribute value
    self._marker_function()
```

By making this correction, the bug causing markers to be filled incorrectly when `fillstyle='none'` will be resolved, and the markers will render as expected according to the provided case values.
