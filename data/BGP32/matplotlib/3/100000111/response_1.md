### Analysis:
The buggy function `_recache()` initializes various attributes of a marker object but fails to correctly handle the case where the `_marker_function` is None. This causes the function to exit prematurely without performing necessary operations, potentially leading to unexpected behavior such as markers not being hollow as intended in the GitHub issue.

### Identified Error:
The issue lies in the condition `if self._marker_function is None:` causing an early return without executing the essential tasks for setting up the marker properties.

### Bug Cause:
The `fillstyle='none'` setting is not being processed correctly due to the premature exit of the `_recache()` function when `_marker_function` is None. This prevents the correct initialization of attributes like `_filled`, which leads to the unexpected behavior of filled markers.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the necessary marker properties are initialized even when `_marker_function` is None. This involves setting up the default attributes like `_filled` to match the expected behavior of hollow markers.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        self._filled = False  # Ensure markers are hollow by default
        self._path = _empty_path
        self._transform = IdentityTransform()
        self._alt_path = None
        self._alt_transform = None
        self._snap_threshold = None
        self._joinstyle = 'round'
        self._capstyle = 'butt'
    else:
        self._path = _empty_path
        self._transform = IdentityTransform()
        self._alt_path = None
        self._alt_transform = None
        self._snap_threshold = None
        self._joinstyle = 'round'
        self._capstyle = 'butt'
        self._filled = True
        self._marker_function()
```

In the corrected version, we explicitly set `_filled` to `False` if `_marker_function` is None, ensuring that markers are hollow by default. This modification guarantees that the marker properties are initialized correctly even in the absence of a custom marker function.
