The buggy function `_recache` is intended to recompute certain marker properties. However, there seems to be an issue related to setting the `_filled` property correctly based on the `self._fillstyle` parameter. The function is missing the logic to handle the `self._fillstyle` parameter and set `_filled` accordingly.

### Bug Explanation:
* The function does not consider the value of `self._fillstyle` to determine whether the marker should be filled or not.
* Currently, the `_filled` property is always set to `True`, regardless of the `self._fillstyle` value.
* This leads to markers always being filled even when the `fillstyle` is set to `'none'`.

### Fix Strategy:
* Introduce a conditional check based on the `self._fillstyle` parameter to determine the value of `_filled`.
* If `self._fillstyle` is `'none'`, set `_filled` to `False` to create hollow markers.
* Modify the function to account for different `fillstyle` values while setting marker properties.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    
    # Update _filled based on self._fillstyle
    self._filled = self._fillstyle != 'none'
    
    self._marker_function()
```

By including the conditional check to update the `_filled` property based on the `self._fillstyle` value, the corrected function will now correctly handle the scenario when the `fillstyle` is set to `'none'`. This change will address the issue where markers are not hollow as expected when using `ax.scatter()` and setting `markers.MarkerStyle()` fillstyle to `'none'`.
