### Analysis:
The buggy function `_recache` is responsible for reinitializing the attributes of a marker object. The issue arises when setting `self._fillstyle` to `'none'` to create a hollow marker. However, the function does not account for this and always sets `self._filled` to `True`, which leads to filled markers instead of hollow ones.

### Error Location:
The main error lies in the line where `self._filled` is always set to `True`, regardless of the value provided for `self._fillstyle`.

### Cause of the Bug:
The bug occurs because the function does not consider the `fillstyle='none'` case, resulting in consistently filled markers.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to update the logic in the `_recache` function to consider the `fillstyle` parameter when determining whether the marker should be filled or hollow.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    self._filled = self._fillstyle != 'none'  # Update to consider fillstyle
    self._marker_function()
```

By making the adjustment in the corrected version, the function now correctly handles the `fillstyle='none'` case, ensuring that the markers will be hollow when intended.
