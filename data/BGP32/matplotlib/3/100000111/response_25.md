### Analysis:
The buggy function `_recache` is called to reset the state of a MarkerStyle object. However, the issue arises when the `filled` attribute is set to `True` unconditionally, which contradicts the desired behavior set by the `fillstyle` parameter in the GitHub issue.

### Bug Explanation:
The bug in the `_recache` function is that the `_filled` attribute is always set to `True`, regardless of the `fillstyle` parameter value. This inconsistency leads to markers not appearing hollow as expected when users set `fillstyle='none'` to indicate hollow markers.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the `_filled` attribute value is set based on the `fillstyle` parameter supplied by the user. If the `fillstyle` is set to `'none'`, then `_filled` should be `False`, representing a hollow marker. Otherwise, it should be `True` for filled markers.

### Corrected Function:
```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    self._filled = self._fillstyle != 'none'  # Set filled based on fillstyle
    self._marker_function()
```

By updating the `_filled` attribute based on the `fillstyle` parameter, the corrected function ensures that markers will appear as hollow when `fillstyle='none'` is specified, addressing the issue reported on GitHub.
