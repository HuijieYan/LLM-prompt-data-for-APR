### Analysis:
The bug occurs in the `_recache` function of the `markers.py` file in the `matplotlib` library. The issue revolves around the marker's fillstyle not being set correctly when a custom MarkerStyle is used. This leads to markers not appearing hollow as expected.

### Error Location:
The bug is likely in the `_recache` function where it is not correctly handling the setting of fillstyle to 'none'.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is caused by the `_recache` function setting `_filled` to `True` unconditionally, regardless of the fillstyle parameter. This leads to markers being filled instead of hollow when the fillstyle is set to 'none'.

### Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to modify the `_recache` function to consider the fillstyle parameter when setting the `_filled` attribute. If the fillstyle is set to 'none', we should set `_filled` to `False` to display hollow markers.

### Corrected Version:
```python
# Assuming the relative path of the correct file: lib/matplotlib/markers.py

def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    
    if self._fillstyle == 'none':
        self._filled = False
    else:
        self._filled = True

    self._marker_function()

# This corrected version of _recache sets _filled to False when fillstyle is 'none'
# Now, hollow markers should be displayed correctly when using custom MarkerStyle with fillstyle='none'
``` 

By making this adjustment, the bug related to markers not appearing hollow when using custom MarkerStyle with fillstyle set to 'none' should be fixed.
