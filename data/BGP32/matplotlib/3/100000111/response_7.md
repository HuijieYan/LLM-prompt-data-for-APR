The buggy function `_recache` is supposed to reset certain attributes to default values and then call the `_marker_function`. However, there seems to be an issue with the expected behavior of setting the `self._filled` attribute to `False`.

The bug arises from not considering the expected behavior of setting `self._filled` to `False`, which contradicts the intended functionality according to the GitHub issue. The `MarkerStyle` with `fillstyle='none'` should be rendered as hollow markers. This inconsistency in setting `self._filled` to `True` in the buggy function leads to the markers not being rendered as hollow as expected by the user in the GitHub issue.

To fix this bug, we need to update the `_filled` attribute according to the `self._fillstyle` parameter. If `self._fillstyle` is set to `'none'`, then `self._filled` should be set to `False`, enabling the representation of hollow markers as intended.

Here is the corrected version of the `_recache` function:
```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    self._filled = self._fillstyle != 'none'
    self._marker_function()
```

By updating the `_filled` attribute based on the `self._fillstyle` parameter, the corrected function aligns with the expected behavior described in the GitHub issue and satisfies the expected input/output values for the failing test execution cases.
