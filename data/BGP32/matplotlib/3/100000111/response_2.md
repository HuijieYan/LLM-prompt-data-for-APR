### Analysis:
The issue described in the GitHub post indicates that when setting `fillstyle='none'` in `markers.MarkerStyle`, the markers are not appearing as hollow as expected. This suggests that the `_recache` function in `markers.MarkerStyle` is not correctly handling the `fillstyle` parameter.

### Error Location:
The bug is likely located in the `_recache` function where the `self._filled` attribute is set to `True`, which contradicts the expected behavior when `fillstyle='none'`.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is caused by the default value of `self._filled` being set to `True` in the `_recache` function. When the `fillstyle` is set to `'none'`, the markers should be hollow (not filled), but the `_filled` attribute being `True` prevents this from happening.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, the `_filled` attribute should be set to `False` when `fillstyle='none'` is specified in `markers.MarkerStyle` to ensure that the markers are hollow.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    
    # Update _filled attribute based on fillstyle
    if self._fillstyle == 'none':
        self._filled = False
    else:
        self._filled = True
        
    self._marker_function()
```

By updating the `_filled` attribute based on the `fillstyle`, we ensure that when `fillstyle='none'`, the markers are hollow as expected.
