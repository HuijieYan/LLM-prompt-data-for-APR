### Analysis:
The buggy function `_recache` is responsible for resetting various attributes related to markers in Matplotlib. The issue mentioned on GitHub indicates that setting `fillstyle='none'` does not result in hollow markers as expected.

### Error Location:
The bug likely resides in how the `_filled` attribute is set to `True` unconditionally within the `_recache` function.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is caused by the `_filled` attribute being set to `True` regardless of the `fillstyle` parameter provided, resulting in markers not being hollow when `fillstyle='none'` is used.

### Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to update the code so that the `_filled` attribute is set based on the `fillstyle` parameter. If `fillstyle` is set to `'none'`, `_filled` should be set to `False`, making the markers hollow.

### Corrected Function:
```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    self._filled = self._fillstyle != 'none'
    self._marker_function()
``` 

By updating the `_filled` attribute based on the `fillstyle` parameter, the corrected function now correctly handles the case where `fillstyle='none'`, making the markers hollow as expected.
