## Bug Explanation
The bug in the `_recache` function is that the `_filled` attribute is always set to `True` regardless of the provided input parameters. This causes the markers to always be filled, even when the intention is to have them hollow, leading to the issue reported on GitHub.

## Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the `_filled` attribute is set based on the input parameter `fillstyle` of the `MarkerStyle`. If the `fillstyle` is set to `'none'`, then `_filled` should be set to `False`. This adjustment will address the problem and make the markers hollow when desired.

## The corrected version of the function
```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    self._filled = 'none' if self._fillstyle == 'none' else True  # Update _filled based on fillstyle
    self._marker_function()
```

With this correction, the `_filled` attribute will be set to `False` when the `fillstyle` is `'none'`, ensuring hollow markers as expected.
