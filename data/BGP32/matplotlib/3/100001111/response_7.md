To fix the bug in the `_recache` function, we need to update the `_filled` attribute based on the value of the `_fillstyle` attribute. If the `_fillstyle` is equal to `'none'`, then `_filled` should be set to `False`. This will ensure that markers are hollow when the `fillstyle` is set to `'none'`.

Here is the corrected version of the `_recache` function:

```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    self._filled = self._fillstyle != 'none'  # Update _filled based on _fillstyle
    self._marker_function()
```

With this correction, the `_filled` attribute will be set correctly depending on the value of `_fillstyle`. This change aligns the behavior of the markers with the expected result when the `fillstyle` is set to `'none'`.

This fix should address the issue described on GitHub where markers were not appearing hollow when using `ax.scatter()` and setting `fillstyle='none'`. Now, with the corrected `_recache` function, the markers should be displayed as hollow when the `fillstyle` is set to `'none'.
