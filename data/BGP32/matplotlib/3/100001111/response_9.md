## Analysis
The buggy function `_recache` is supposed to update the internal attributes of an object, including `_path`, `_snap_threshold`, `_joinstyle`, `_capstyle`, and `_filled`. The bug arises from not updating the `_filled` attribute correctly within the function, which causes unexpected behavior as reported in the GitHub issue where markers are not hollow despite setting the `fillstyle` parameter to `'none'`.

## Error Location
The error lies in assigning `self._filled = True` within the `_recache` function, which should be corrected to `self._filled = False` based on the expected values.

## Bug Cause
The bug is caused by setting `_filled` as `True` instead of `False`, leading to markers not being hollow when the expected behavior is to have hollow markers. This discrepancy results in the reported issue on GitHub.

## Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, update the assignment of `self._filled` from `True` to `False` within the `_recache` function, aligning with the expected behavior.

## The corrected version of the function
```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    self._filled = False
    self._marker_function()
``` 

By updating the assignment of `self._filled` to `False` in the corrected function, the markers should now appear as hollow, addressing the reported issue where setting the `fillstyle` parameter to `'none'` was not leading to the desired outcome.
