The issue here is that the `_filled` attribute is being set to `True` unconditionally in the `_recache` function, which contradicts the expected behavior mentioned in the GitHub issue. To fix this bug, we need to modify the `_recache` function to set `_filled` based on the `fillstyle` attribute of the `MarkerStyle` object.

Here is the corrected version of the `_recache` function:

```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    
    # Check if fillstyle is set to 'none' for hollow markers
    if self._fillstyle == 'none':
        self._filled = False
    else:
        self._filled = True
        
    self._marker_function()
```

With this modification, the `_filled` attribute will be set based on the `fillstyle` attribute of the `MarkerStyle` object, allowing for hollow markers when `fillstyle='none'` is specified. This aligns with the expected behavior described in the GitHub issue.
