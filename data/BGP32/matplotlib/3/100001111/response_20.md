To fix the bug in the `_recache` function, we need to update the `_filled` variable to `False` when the `self._fillstyle` is set to `'none'`. This change will ensure that markers are rendered as hollow when the fillstyle is set to `'none'`.

Here is the corrected version of the `_recache` function:

```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    self._filled = self._fillstyle != 'none'
    self._marker_function()
```

By updating the `_filled` variable based on the value of `_fillstyle` being `'none' or not, the markers will be correctly rendered as hollow when the fillstyle is set to `'none' as per the expected behavior described in the GitHub issue.

This fix should resolve the issue with markers not being hollow when using `ax.scatter()` and setting `markers.MarkerStyle()`'s fillstyle to `'none' as reported in GitHub issue.
