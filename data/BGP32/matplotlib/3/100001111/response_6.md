## Analysis
The buggy function `_recache()` sets default values for various attributes related to markers in Matplotlib. One crucial issue is that it always calls `self._marker_function()` at the end, regardless of the current setting of `self._marker_function`. This can lead to unexpected behavior and may not match the expected output values.

## Error location
The bug lies in the unconditional call to `self._marker_function()` at the end of the function.

## Cause of the bug
In the provided test cases, the expected `self._filled` value is different from the actual value after the function execution. This discrepancy seems to be because the default value for `self._filled` should be `False`, but it is set to `True` due to the uncontrolled call to `self._marker_function()`.

## Fix strategy
To fix the bug, it is necessary to only call `self._marker_function()` if the attribute `self._marker_function` is not `None`. This change will ensure that a custom marker function is called only when it is actually defined.

## Corrected Version of the Function
```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is not None:
        self._path = _empty_path
        self._transform = IdentityTransform()
        self._alt_path = None
        self._alt_transform = None
        self._snap_threshold = None
        self._joinstyle = 'round'
        self._capstyle = 'butt'
        self._filled = True
        self._marker_function()
```
