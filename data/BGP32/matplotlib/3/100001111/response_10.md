## Analysis:
The buggy function `_recache` is supposed to reset certain attributes when the `_marker_function` is not None. However, according to the failing test cases, it incorrectly resets the `_filled` attribute to True every time, regardless of its initial value.

## Bug Cause:
The bug in the `_recache` function causes the `self._filled` attribute to always be set to True, even when it is expected to be False. This behavior contradicts the expected behavior where `_filled` should remain as False.

## Bug Fix:
To fix the bug, we need to assess when the `_filled` attribute should be set to False and modify the logic accordingly.

## Corrected Version:
```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    if self._fillstyle == 'none':
        self._filled = False
    else:
        self._filled = True
    self._marker_function()
```
