## Bug Fix

### Analysis:
The buggy function `_recache` is being called in the context of custom markers in Matplotlib where the fillstyle is expected to be set to `'none'` to create hollow markers. However, the bug in the function is that it always sets `_filled` to `True`, completely disregarding the fillstyle provided. This results in markers always being filled, even when `fillstyle='none'`.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the `_filled` variable is set based on the `fillstyle` provided. If `fillstyle` is set to `'none'`, then `_filled` should be set to `False` to create hollow markers as expected.

### Bug Fix:
Here is the corrected version of the `_recache` function:

```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    self._filled = False if self.get_fillstyle() == 'none' else True
    self._marker_function()
```

By modifying the assignment of `_filled` based on the `fillstyle`, the function now correctly interprets the provided `fillstyle` and creates hollow markers when `fillstyle='none'` as expected. This fix addresses the issue reported on GitHub where markers were not hollow when using `ax.scatter()` and setting `fillstyle='none'`.
