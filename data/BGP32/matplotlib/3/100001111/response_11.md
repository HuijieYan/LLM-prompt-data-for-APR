## Analyzing the bug

The bug occurs in the `_recache` function of the `markers.py` file in the `matplotlib` library. The function is supposed to recache markers but fails to set the `self._filled` attribute correctly when called. This leads to markers not being hollow when intended.

The expected behavior is that when specifying `fillstyle='none'` in `MarkerStyle`, the markers should be hollow. However, due to the bug in the `_recache` function, the `_filled` attribute is not set correctly, resulting in filled markers.

## Bug Explanation

The `_recache` function sets default values for various attributes related to the marker. The bug is in setting the `_filled` attribute. The expected behavior based on the GitHub issue is that when `fillstyle='none'`, the markers should be hollow, which translates to `_filled=False`.

However, in the buggy function, `_filled` is set to `True` unconditionally, which causes the markers to be filled even when `fillstyle='none'`.

## Fix Strategy

To fix the bug, we need to update the `_filled` attribute based on the value of `fillstyle` from the `MarkerStyle` object. If `fillstyle` is `'none'`, then `_filled` should be set to `False` to ensure the markers are hollow.

## Corrected Version
```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    self._filled = not (self._fillstyle == 'none')
    self._marker_function()
```

In the corrected version, `_filled` is set based on the condition that `self._fillstyle` is not equal to `'none'`. This change ensures that when `fillstyle='none'`, the markers will be hollow as expected.
