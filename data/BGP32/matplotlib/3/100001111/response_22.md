## Bug Fix

### Analysis:
The buggy function `_recache` sets the `_filled` attribute to `True` unconditionally, which conflicts with the expected behavior described in the GitHub issue. The issue mentions that setting `fillstyle='none'` should result in hollow markers, which implies that `_filled` should be `False`.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is caused by the incorrect setting of the `_filled` attribute to `True` regardless of the `fillstyle` being specified as 'none'.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the `_filled` attribute is set based on the `fillstyle` parameter. If the `fillstyle` is 'none', then `_filled` should be set to `False`.

### Corrected Function:
```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    
    if self.get_fillstyle() == 'none':
        self._filled = False
    else:
        self._filled = True
    
    self._marker_function()
```

By adding the conditional check based on the `fillstyle` attribute, we ensure that the `_filled` attribute aligns with the expected behavior where hollow markers should be displayed.

This fix addresses the reported issue on GitHub regarding markers not being hollow when using `ax.scatter()` with `fillstyle='none'`.
