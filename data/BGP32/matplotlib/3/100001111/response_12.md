To fix the issue and correct the buggy function, we need to update the `_recache` function by setting the `self._filled` attribute based on the `self._fillstyle` attribute. This will ensure that the marker is rendered as hollow when the `fillstyle` is 'none'.

Here is the corrected version of the `_recache` function:

```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    self._filled = self._fillstyle != 'none'
    self._marker_function()
```

With this update, the `self._filled` attribute will be set based on the `self._fillstyle` attribute, and markers will be rendered as hollow when the `fillstyle` is 'none'. This change will resolve the issue reported on GitHub regarding markers not appearing hollow when using `ax.scatter()` and setting `fillstyle='none'`.

Make sure to apply this fix in the `lib/matplotlib/markers.py` file where the original buggy function is located.
