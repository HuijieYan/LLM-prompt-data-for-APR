Based on the information provided, it seems that the bug in the `_recache` function is related to the incorrect initialization of the `_filled` variable. In Case 1, the `_filled` variable is set to `True` instead of the expected value `False`, causing markers to be filled even when `fillstyle='none'` is specified.

To fix the bug, we need to correctly set the `_filled` variable based on the `fillstyle` parameter. If `fillstyle` is set to `'none'`, then `_filled` should be `False`.

Here is the corrected version of the `_recache` function:
```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    self._filled = False if self._fillstyle == 'none' else True
    self._marker_function()
```

By updating the `_filled` variable based on the value of `_fillstyle`, the corrected function will ensure that markers are hollow when `fillstyle='none'` is specified, resolving the issue reported on GitHub.
