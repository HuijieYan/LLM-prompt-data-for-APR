## Fixing the Bug

### Analysis:
The bug occurs in the `_recache` function where the `_filled` attribute is always set to `True` without considering the actual value of `fillstyle` that should determine if the marker is filled or not. This causes an issue where markers are not hollow when the `fillstyle` is set to `'none'`.

### Error Location:
The key error is in the assignment of the `_filled` attribute within the `_recache` function.

### Cause of the Bug:
The bug is caused by always setting `_filled` to `True` within the `_recache` function regardless of the actual `fillstyle` value set by the user. This inconsistency leads to markers not being hollow as intended when `fillstyle` is set to `'none'`.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to update the `_recache` function to reflect the value of `fillstyle` in determining whether a marker is filled or not. By updating the `_filled` attribute based on the `fillstyle` parameter, we can ensure that the markers are displayed correctly.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    self._filled = self.get_fillstyle() != 'none'
    self._marker_function()
```

In this corrected version, the `_filled` attribute is updated based on the `fillstyle` parameter. This modification ensures that when `fillstyle` is set to `'none'`, the markers will be hollow as expected.

By incorporating this fix, the markers should behave correctly, including when using the sample code provided in the GitHub issue.
