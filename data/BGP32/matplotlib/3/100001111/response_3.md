To fix the bug in the `_recache` function, we need to update the `_filled` attribute based on the provided `_fillstyle` parameter. The `_filled` attribute controls whether the marker is filled or hollow, so we should set it to `False` when `_fillstyle` is set to `'none'`.

Here is the corrected version of the `_recache` function:

```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    
    if self._fillstyle == 'none':
        self._filled = False
    else:
        self._filled = True
    
    self._marker_function()
```

By checking the `_fillstyle` attribute and updating the `_filled` attribute accordingly, we ensure that the markers are hollow when `fillstyle='none'`, as expected by the users, as described in the GitHub issue provided.

This correction should address the issue and provide the expected behavior when using the `ax.scatter()` function and customizing the marker style with `fillstyle='none'`.
