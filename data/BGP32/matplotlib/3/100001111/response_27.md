## Analysis
The buggy function `_recache()` is called to reset attributes related to markers. In the provided case, the `self._filled` attribute is being set to `True` unconditionally, which contradicts the expected behavior (it should be set to `False` in some cases). This discrepancy is causing the markers not to appear hollow when the fill style is set to `'none'`.

## Bug Cause
The bug is induced by setting `self._filled = True` unconditionally in the `_recache()` function. This setting contradicts the expected behavior specified in the failing test case where `self._filled` should be `False` in certain scenarios.

## Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to adjust the logic within the `_recache()` function to ensure that the `self._filled` attribute is set according to the expected behavior. This can be achieved by incorporating conditional logic based on the fill style parameter.

## Corrected Code
```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    if self.fillstyle == 'none':
        self._filled = False
    else:
        self._filled = True
    self._marker_function()
```

By adding conditional logic to set `self._filled` based on the fill style parameter, we ensure that the markers will appear hollow when the intended fill style is 'none'. This correction addresses the issue reported on GitHub and aligns with the expected behavior specified in the failing test cases.
