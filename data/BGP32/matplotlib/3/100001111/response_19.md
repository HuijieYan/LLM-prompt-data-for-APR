## Bug Fix

### Analysis:
The buggy function `_recache` sets the `_filled` attribute to `True` unconditionally, which contradicts the expected behavior outlined in the GitHub issue where setting `fillstyle='none'` should result in hollow markers. This leads to the markers not being hollow as expected.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To resolve this issue, the `_filled` attribute needs to be set based on the provided `fillstyle` value in the `MarkerStyle` object.

### Updated Corrected Version:
```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    self._filled = self._fillstyle != 'none'
    self._marker_function()
```

With this correction, the `_filled` attribute is set based on the `fillstyle` parameter in the `MarkerStyle` object, ensuring that hollow markers can be achieved by setting `fillstyle='none'` as described in the GitHub issue.
