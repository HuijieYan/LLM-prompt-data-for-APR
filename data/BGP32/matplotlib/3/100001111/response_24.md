## Analysis
The buggy function `_recache` is not correctly handling the case where the `self._marker_function` is not None. It is reinitializing the variables without considering the existing state, leading to incorrect behavior.

### Error Location
The issue lies in the `if self._marker_function is None` condition. When it is not None, the function skips resetting the variables but still calls `self._marker_function`, which seems to be inappropriate based on the intended behavior.

### Cause of the Bug
In the given buggy function, when the `_marker_function` is not None, the function should not reset all variables. By calling `_marker_function` in that scenario, it may lead to unintended side effects causing markers not appearing as hollow when `fillstyle='none'`.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug
The bug can be fixed by adjusting the logic in the `_recache` function to only call `self._marker_function` when it is not None, without resetting the variables that might have meaningful values from the previous state.

## Bug-fixed Version
```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is not None:
        self._marker_function()
``` 

In the bug-fixed version of the `_recache` function, it only calls `self._marker_function` when it is not None, allowing the saved variables to retain their values and prevent unintended side effects.
