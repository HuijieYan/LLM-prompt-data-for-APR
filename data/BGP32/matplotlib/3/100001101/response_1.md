### Analysis
The buggy function `_recache` is intended to reset certain attributes of an object before calling a marker function. However, in the given implementation, the expected values for `self._fillstyle` are not being set or utilized. Additionally, the `self._filled` attribute is always set to `True`, which contradicts the expected values in some cases.

### Bug Explanation
1. The `self._fillstyle` attribute is not being set or utilized in the `_recache` function, which is necessary for setting the fillstyle correctly.
2. The `self._filled` attribute is always being set to `True`, which does not match the expected values in some cases.

### Bug Fix Strategy
1. Update the `_recache` function to include setting the `self._fillstyle` attribute based on the expected values.
2. Adjust the setting of the `self._filled` attribute to match the expected values in each case.

### Corrected Version
```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    
    if self._fillstyle == 'none':
        self._filled = False
    else:
        self._filled = True
    
    self._marker_function()
```
