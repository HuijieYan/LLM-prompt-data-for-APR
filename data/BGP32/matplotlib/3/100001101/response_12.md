### Bug Analysis
The buggy function `_recache` is supposed to update certain attributes of the object based on its current state. However, it does not handle all the necessary updates correctly, leading to potential issues. One specific issue is with the `_filled` attribute being set to `True` unconditionally, even though the expected values show that it should be set to `False` in some cases.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the `_filled` attribute is updated appropriately based on the expected values. We will add a check to set `_filled` to `False` in the relevant cases.

### Corrected Code
```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    
    if self._fillstyle == 'none':
        self._filled = False
    else:
        self._filled = True
        
    self._marker_function()
``` 

By adding the conditional check based on the `_fillstyle` attribute, the corrected function now updates the `_filled` attribute correctly according to the expected values provided.
