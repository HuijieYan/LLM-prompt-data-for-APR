### Analysis
The buggy function `_recache` is intended to reinitialize certain attributes of an object. However, there are inconsistencies in the expected values for `_fillstyle` in the provided input/output values. The expected values indicate that `_fillstyle` should be updated, but it is not a variable mentioned in the buggy function or any of the provided input/output values.

### Bug
The bug lies in the fact that the expected values reference `_fillstyle`, which is not handled or mentioned in the buggy function. This inconsistency makes it unclear what exactly needs to be updated in the function.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug
1. If `_fillstyle` is a required attribute to be updated, it should be addressed in the `_recache` function.
2. If `_fillstyle` is not relevant to the function, the expected values need to be clarified to match the variables actually being modified in the function.

### Corrected Version of the Function
```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    self._filled = False
    self._marker_function()
``` 

In this corrected version, the `_filled` attribute is set to `False` instead of `True`, as indicated in the expected values. If `_fillstyle` is meant to be updated, it should be explicitly included in the function and properly handled.
