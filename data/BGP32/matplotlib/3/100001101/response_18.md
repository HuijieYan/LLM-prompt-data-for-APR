The bug in the `_recache` function lies in not setting the `_filled` variable to the expected value of `False` as shown in the failing test case. This causes the function to not behave as expected when `self._marker_function()` is called.

To fix the bug, we should update the function to set `_filled` to `False` as expected.

Here is the corrected version of the `_recache` function:

```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    self._filled = False
    self._marker_function()
```

This modification ensures that the `_filled` variable is set to `False` as expected, fixing the bug in the function.
