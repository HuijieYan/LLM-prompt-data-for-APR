The bug in the `_recache` function stems from the incorrect assignment of the `_filled` variable. It is supposed to be set to `False` instead of `True` as it is mistakenly done in the buggy function.

To fix the bug, we should update the assignment of `_filled` to `False` as expected in the test cases.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    self._filled = False
    self._marker_function()
``` 

This correction should resolve the bug by aligning the assignment of `_filled` with the expected values in the test cases.
