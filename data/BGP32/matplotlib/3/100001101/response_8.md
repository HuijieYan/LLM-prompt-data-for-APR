### Analysis
The buggy function `_recache` is supposed to reset several attributes to their default values and then call a marker function. However, there seems to be a bug as it is setting the `_filled` attribute to `True` unconditionally. This is not consistent with the expected values.

### Bug
The bug lies in the line `self._filled = True`. It should be set to `False` according to the expected values.

### Fix
Change `self._filled = True` to `self._filled = False` to fix the bug.

### Corrected Version
```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    self._filled = False
    self._marker_function()
```
