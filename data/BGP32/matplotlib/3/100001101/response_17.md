The bug in the function `_recache` is that it does not correctly set the `_filled` variable to `False`, as expected by the test cases. This results in an incorrect behavior of the function. To fix this bug, we need to update the function to set `_filled` to `False` as expected.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    self._filled = False  # Updating _filled to False as expected
    self._marker_function()
``` 

By making this change, the function will now correctly set `_filled` to `False` as expected by the test cases, fixing the bug.
