The bug in the provided function `_recache` is that it doesn't handle the `_filled` attribute correctly. It always sets `_filled` to `True` regardless of the actual expected value. This causes the function to not reflect the correct values for `_filled`.

To fix this bug, we need to adjust the function to correctly set the `_filled` attribute based on the expected value.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    
    # Adjusting _filled attribute based on expected value
    if self._fillstyle == 'none':
        self._filled = False
    else:
        self._filled = True
        
    self._marker_function()
```

By adding the condition to set the `_filled` attribute based on the expected value of `_fillstyle`, we ensure that the function correctly reflects the expected values for all attributes, including `_filled`.
