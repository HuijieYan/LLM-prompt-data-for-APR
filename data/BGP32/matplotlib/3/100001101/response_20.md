### Analysis
The buggy function `_recache` is not correctly setting the `_filled` variable to `False` as expected in the second case. This is likely causing issues with the marker representation or transformation.

### Bug Location
The bug is in the line where `_filled` is set to `True` unconditionally.

### Bug Explanation
In the second case, the expected value of `_filled` is `False`, but the buggy function always sets it to `True`, which is causing the discrepancy.

### Bug Fix
To fix the bug, we need to set `_filled` to `False` explicitly in the function.

### Corrected Version
```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    self._filled = False
    self._marker_function()
```
