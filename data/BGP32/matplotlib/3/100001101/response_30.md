The buggy function `_recache` is not updating the `_filled` attribute correctly as per the expected values. The expected behavior is to set `_filled` to `False`, but the function is always setting it to `True`.

To fix this issue, we need to update the function to set `_filled` to `False` as expected.

```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    self._filled = False  # Updated to set _filled to False
    self._marker_function()
```

By making this modification, the function will correctly set the `_filled` attribute to `False` as expected and satisfy the conditions of the failing test cases.
