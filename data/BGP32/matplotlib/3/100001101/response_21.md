The bug in the `_recache` function is that it is not setting the `self._filled` variable to the expected value of `False` in any case. 

### Cause of the bug:
The function sets all the variables to default values but fails to update the `self._filled` variable to match the expected value.

### Strategy to fix the bug:
To fix the bug, we need to update the function to set the `self._filled` variable to `False` as expected in all cases.

### Corrected version of the function:
```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    self._filled = False  # Fix: setting self._filled to False
    self._marker_function()
``` 

By updating the function to set `self._filled` to `False`, we fix the bug and ensure that all variables are correctly updated as expected.
