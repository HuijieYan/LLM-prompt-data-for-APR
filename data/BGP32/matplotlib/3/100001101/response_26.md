The bug in the provided function `_recache` is that it sets `self._filled` to always be `True` without considering any conditions. This leads to the incorrect behavior that `self._filled` is always `True` regardless of the input.

To fix this bug, we need to update the function to properly handle the setting of `self._filled` based on the input parameters. We can introduce a condition or logic that correctly assigns `self._filled` to either `True` or `False` based on the input. 

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    
    # Update the logic to set self._filled correctly
    if self._fillstyle == 'none':
        self._filled = False
    else:
        self._filled = True
    
    self._marker_function()
```

With this correction, the function will now correctly set `self._filled` based on the value of `self._fillstyle`, resolving the bug and satisfying the expected input/output values.
