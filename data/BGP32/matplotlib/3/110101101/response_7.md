### Bug Explanation
The bug in the `_recache` function is that the function does not properly set the `self._filled` attribute according to the `fillstyle` parameter provided during the initialization of the `MarkerStyle` object. As a result, the `is_filled` method does not return the expected value during the test.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to update the `_recache` function to set the `self._filled` attribute based on the `fillstyle` parameter provided during the initialization of the `MarkerStyle` object.

### The corrected version of the `_recache` function

```python
class MarkerStyle():

    def _recache(self):
        if self._marker_function is None:
            return
        self._path = _empty_path
        self._transform = IdentityTransform()
        self._alt_path = None
        self._alt_transform = None
        self._snap_threshold = None
        self._joinstyle = 'round'
        self._capstyle = 'butt'
        self._filled = self._fillstyle != 'none'  # Set filled attribute based on fillstyle
        self._marker_function()
```

After applying this fix, the `is_filled` method should return the correct value based on the `fillstyle` parameter provided during object initialization, and the failing test should pass as expected.
