### Bug Explanation
The bug in the `_recache` function is that it sets `_filled` to `True` unconditionally, even if the fillstyle is set to `'none'`. This results in the `MarkerStyle` object always being marked as filled, regardless of the specified fillstyle.

### Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to modify the `_recache` function to set `_filled` based on the fillstyle provided during object initialization. If the fillstyle is set to `'none'`, `_filled` should be set to `False`.

### Corrected Version of the `_recache` Function
```python
    def _recache(self):
        if self._marker_function is None:
            return
        self._path = _empty_path
        self._transform = IdentityTransform()
        self._alt_path = None
        self._alt_transform = None
        self._snap_threshold = None
        self._joinstyle = 'round'
        self._capstyle = 'butt'
        self._filled = self._fillstyle != 'none'
        self._marker_function()
``` 

By making this change, the `_filled` attribute of the `MarkerStyle` object will now respect the fillstyle set during object initialization, fixing the bug identified in the failing test scenario.
