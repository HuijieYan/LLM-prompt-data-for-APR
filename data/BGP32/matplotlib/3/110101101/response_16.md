The bug in the `_recache` function lies in the fact that the `_filled` attribute is always set to `True` regardless of the `fillstyle` value provided during the instantiation of the `MarkerStyle` object.

### Cause of the bug:
The `_filled` attribute is always set to `True` in the `_recache` function without considering the `fillstyle` that was provided. This leads to incorrect behavior when checking if the marker is filled or not.

### Strategy for fixing the bug:
To fix the bug, we need to update the `_filled` attribute based on the `fillstyle` provided during the instantiation of the `MarkerStyle` object. If the `fillstyle` is `'none'`, then `_filled` should be set to `False`, indicating that the marker should not be filled.

### Corrected version of the `_recache` function:
```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: lib/matplotlib/markers.py

# The declaration of the class containing the corrected function
class MarkerStyle():

    def _recache(self):
        if self._marker_function is None:
            return
        self._path = _empty_path
        self._transform = IdentityTransform()
        self._alt_path = None
        self._alt_transform = None
        self._snap_threshold = None
        self._joinstyle = 'round'
        self._capstyle = 'butt'
        self._filled = self.get_fillstyle() != 'none'
        self._marker_function()
```

Now, with this corrected version of the `_recache` function, the provided failing test `test_marker_fillstyle` should pass as expected.
