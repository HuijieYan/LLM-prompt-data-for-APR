### Analysis
The buggy function `_recache` is supposed to recache the marker style properties. However, there is an issue with setting the `_filled` property correctly, which is causing the failing test. The function sets `_filled = True` unconditionally, leading to incorrect behavior when the test expects `_filled` to be `False` for a specific marker style.

### Bug Cause
The bug is caused by the `_filled` property being set to `True` unconditionally in the `_recache` function. This overrides any value that may have been set for `_filled` previously, leading to incorrect behavior.

### Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the `_filled` property is only set to `True` when it should be filled, based on the marker style. In this case, the `_filled` property should be set to `False` when the `fillstyle` is set to `'none'`.

### The corrected version of the buggy function
```python
class MarkerStyle():

    def _recache(self):
        if self._marker_function is None:
            return
        self._path = _empty_path
        self._transform = IdentityTransform()
        self._alt_path = None
        self._alt_transform = None
        self._snap_threshold = None
        self._joinstyle = 'round'
        self._capstyle = 'butt'
        self._filled = self._fillstyle != 'none'
        self._marker_function()
``` 

This corrected version will set `_filled` to `True` only when the `fillstyle` is not `'none'`, which aligns with the expected behavior in the failing test case.
