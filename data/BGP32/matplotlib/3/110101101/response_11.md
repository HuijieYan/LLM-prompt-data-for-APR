## Analysis
The buggy function `_recache` is supposed to reset certain attributes to default values if `_marker_function` is not None. However, it seems to be missing the logic to correctly handle the `fillstyle` attribute. The failing test `test_marker_fillstyle` expects the `fillstyle` attribute to be set to `'none'`, but the buggy function does not handle this attribute.

## Bug
The bug lies in the fact that the `fillstyle` attribute is not being properly handled in the `_recache` function. This results in the failing test `test_marker_fillstyle` not passing because the `fillstyle` is not being set to `'none'`.

## Fix
To fix the bug, we need to add the handling of the `fillstyle` attribute in the `_recache` function. We should make sure that when the `fillstyle` is set to `'none'`, the `_filled` attribute should be set to `False`.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    self._filled = self._fillstyle != 'none'
    self._marker_function()
```

With this correction, the `_recache` function should now handle the `fillstyle` attribute correctly, setting `_filled` to `False` when `fillstyle` is `'none'`. This change should make the failing test `test_marker_fillstyle` pass as expected.
