## Explanation:
The bug in the `_recache` function arises from setting `_filled` to `True` unconditionally at the end of the function, regardless of the marker fillstyle specified. This causes the function to always consider the marker as filled, leading to the failing test cases.

## Fix:
Modify the `_recache` function to set `_filled` based on the fillstyle specified in the MarkerStyle initialization.

## Corrected Version:
```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: lib/matplotlib/markers.py

# The declaration of the class containing the buggy function
class MarkerStyle():
    # The corrected version of the 'recache' function
    def _recache(self):
        if self._marker_function is None:
            return
        self._path = _empty_path
        self._transform = IdentityTransform()
        self._alt_path = None
        self._alt_transform = None
        self._snap_threshold = None
        self._joinstyle = 'round'
        self._capstyle = 'butt'
        self._filled = self._fillstyle != 'none'
        self._marker_function()
```

By updating the `_recache` function to consider the fillstyle in determining whether the marker should be filled or not, the corrected version ensures that the MarkerStyle object behaves as intended, passing the failing test cases.
