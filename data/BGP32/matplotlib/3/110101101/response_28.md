The issue in the `_recache` function lies in the fact that it is not properly updating the fillstyle attribute, which is required by the failing test `test_marker_fillstyle`. The expected behavior is that when `fillstyle` is set to `'none'`, the `is_filled()` method should return `False`.

To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the `fillstyle` attribute is correctly updated when the `_recache` function is called. Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
class MarkerStyle():

    # corrected _recache function
    def _recache(self):
        if self._marker_function is None:
            return
        self._path = _empty_path
        self._transform = IdentityTransform()
        self._alt_path = None
        self._alt_transform = None
        self._snap_threshold = None
        self._joinstyle = 'round'
        self._capstyle = 'butt'
        self._filled = self._fillstyle != 'none'  # update filled based on fillstyle
        self._marker_function()
```

This corrected version ensures that the `filled` attribute is updated based on the value of `fillstyle`, allowing the failing test `test_marker_fillstyle` to pass successfully. Thank you for your assistance.
