## Bug Explanation
The bug in the `_recache` function lies in the fact that the `self._filled` variable is always set to `True` regardless of the input parameters or conditions within the function. This causes the `is_filled()` method to always return `True`, leading to failing tests when it should return `False` for specific cases where `fillstyle='none'`.

## Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the `self._filled` variable is set based on the actual value of `self._fillstyle` rather than being hardcoded to `True`.

## The Corrected Version
```python
# The corrected version of the buggy function
class MarkerStyle():
    def _recache(self):
        if self._marker_function is None:
            return
        self._path = _empty_path
        self._transform = IdentityTransform()
        self._alt_path = None
        self._alt_transform = None
        self._snap_threshold = None
        self._joinstyle = 'round'
        self._capstyle = 'butt'
        self._filled = self._fillstyle != 'none'
        self._marker_function()
```

By updating the assignment of `self._filled` to check if `self._fillstyle` is not equal to `'none'`, we ensure that the correct filled status is captured based on the input parameters, resolving the bug.
