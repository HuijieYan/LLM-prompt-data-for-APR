The buggy function `_recache` in the `MarkerStyle` class fails to appropriately set the fillstyle and is not updating the `_filled` attribute accordingly. This causes the failing test case where the expected `fillstyle` is `'none'` but the `_filled` attribute is still `True`.

To fix this issue, we need to adjust the function to properly update the `_filled` attribute based on the fillstyle provided when creating the `MarkerStyle` instance.

Here is the corrected version of the `_recache` function:

```python
# The corrected version of the buggy function
class MarkerStyle():

    def _recache(self):
        if self._marker_function is None:
            return
        self._path = _empty_path
        self._transform = IdentityTransform()
        self._alt_path = None
        self._alt_transform = None
        self._snap_threshold = None
        self._joinstyle = 'round'
        self._capstyle = 'butt'
        self._filled = self.fillstyle != 'none'  # Updated line to check if fillstyle is not 'none'
        self._marker_function()
```

With this correction, the `_filled` attribute will be updated based on the fillstyle provided, ensuring that it reflects whether the marker should be filled or not.

This corrected version should now pass the failing test case `test_marker_fillstyle`.
