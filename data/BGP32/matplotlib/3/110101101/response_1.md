### Bug analysis
The `_recache` function is failing to correctly set the `self._filled` attribute based on the `_marker_function` value. It is always setting `self._filled` to `True` regardless of the marker function. This is causing the failing test as it expects `False` for the `is_filled()` method when `fillstyle='none'`.

### Bug fix strategy
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the `_filled` attribute is set appropriately based on the `fillstyle` parameter passed to the `MarkerStyle` constructor. We can modify the `_recache` function to correctly handle this logic.

### Corrected version of the function
```python
class MarkerStyle():

    def _recache(self):
        if self._marker_function is None:
            return
        
        self._path = _empty_path
        self._transform = IdentityTransform()
        self._alt_path = None
        self._alt_transform = None
        self._snap_threshold = None
        self._joinstyle = 'round'
        self._capstyle = 'butt'
        
        if self.get_fillstyle() == 'none':
            self._filled = False
        else:
            self._filled = True
        
        self._marker_function()
```

By adding the conditional check based on the `fillstyle`, we ensure that the `_filled` attribute is correctly set according to the marker style being used. This correction should make the failing test pass successfully.
