### Analysis
The bug in the `_recache` function is that it is calling `self._marker_function()` without checking if `_marker_function` is actually assigned a function. This is leading to an error when trying to call a method that does not exist, causing the test failures.

### Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to first check if `_marker_function` is not `None` before trying to call it. This will ensure that we only call the function if it has been properly assigned.

### Corrected Version
```python
class MarkerStyle():

    def _recache(self):
        if self._marker_function is not None:
            self._path = _empty_path
            self._transform = IdentityTransform()
            self._alt_path = None
            self._alt_transform = None
            self._snap_threshold = None
            self._joinstyle = 'round'
            self._capstyle = 'butt'
            self._filled = True
            self._marker_function()
``` 

By adding the check `if self._marker_function is not None:`, we ensure that only if `_marker_function` is assigned a function, it will be called within the `_recache` function. This should fix the bug and make the failing test pass.
