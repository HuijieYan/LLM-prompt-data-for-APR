### Analyze the buggy function

The `_recache` function in the `MarkerStyle` class is causing the test failure. The function is supposed to re-cache attributes related to the marker style but it currently has a bug that leads to incorrect behavior. 

### Potential error locations

The bug seems to be occurring in the line `self._marker_function()` where it is trying to call a method that is not defined or set in the constructor of the class.

### Cause of the bug

The error message indicates that the `is_filled` method is not returning the expected result. This implies that the `MarkerStyle` object is not properly initialized with the correct values for the fill style. The `self._marker_function()` call in the `_recache` method might be responsible for setting up these values, but as it is not defined in the snippet provided, it is causing the test to fail.

### Strategy for fixing the bug

To fix the bug, we need to make sure that all necessary methods for setting up the marker style attributes are properly defined and called during the initialization of the `MarkerStyle` object.

### Corrected version of the buggy function

Here is the corrected version of the `_recache` function:

```python
class MarkerStyle():

    def _recache(self):
        if self._marker_function is not None:
            self._path = _empty_path
            self._transform = IdentityTransform()
            self._alt_path = None
            self._alt_transform = None
            self._snap_threshold = None
            self._joinstyle = 'round'
            self._capstyle = 'butt'
            self._filled = True
            self._marker_function()
```

Make sure to define and set the `_marker_function` method correctly in the class constructor to ensure that the necessary attributes are properly initialized.
