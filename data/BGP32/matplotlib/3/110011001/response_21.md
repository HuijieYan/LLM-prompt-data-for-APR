### Analysis
In the provided function `_recache`, the bug lies in the line `self._marker_function()` where the `MarkerStyle` object is trying to call a method that might not exist. This leads to an assertion error in the failing test related to `is_filled()` method.

### Bug Cause
The bug occurs because the `_marker_function` attribute is not properly handled. If it is `None`, the function should not be called, but the current implementation is calling it unconditionally.

### Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we should first check if `_marker_function` is not `None` before calling it in the `_recache` method.

### Corrected Version
```python
class MarkerStyle():
    def _recache(self):
        if self._marker_function is not None:  # Check if _marker_function is not None before calling it
            self._path = _empty_path
            self._transform = IdentityTransform()
            self._alt_path = None
            self._alt_transform = None
            self._snap_threshold = None
            self._joinstyle = 'round'
            self._capstyle = 'butt'
            self._filled = True
            self._marker_function()
``` 

By adding the check for `self._marker_function is not None:`, we ensure that the method is only called if it exists, avoiding the assertion error encountered in the failing test.
