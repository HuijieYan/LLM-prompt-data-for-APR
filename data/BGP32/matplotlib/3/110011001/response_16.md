### Bug Explanation
The bug in the `_recache` function is that it is not correctly checking if the `_marker_function` exists before calling it. This results in an error when trying to execute a method that doesn't exist, leading to the failing test.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to add a check to ensure that `_marker_function` exists before calling it. This check will prevent the error caused by trying to call a non-existent method.

### Corrected Version
```python
class MarkerStyle():


    def _recache(self):
        if self._marker_function is not None:
            self._path = _empty_path
            self._transform = IdentityTransform()
            self._alt_path = None
            self._alt_transform = None
            self._snap_threshold = None
            self._joinstyle = 'round'
            self._capstyle = 'butt'
            self._filled = True
            self._marker_function()
``` 

By adding the check `if self._marker_function is not None`, we ensure that the `_marker_function` is only called if it exists, preventing the error and allowing the function to work correctly.
