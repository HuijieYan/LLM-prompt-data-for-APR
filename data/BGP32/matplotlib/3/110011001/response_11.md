### Analysis
In the provided buggy function `_recache`, the issue lies in the line `self._marker_function()`. This line is causing the test to fail because it is trying to execute a method that does not exist or is not properly defined within the `MarkerStyle` class. This causes an `AssertionError` in the failing test.

### Bug Explanation
The bug occurs because the `is_filled` method is missing or incorrectly implemented in the `MarkerStyle` class. The failing test expects this method to return `True` or `False` based on the value of the `_filled` attribute, but since the method is missing or faulty, the test fails when trying to validate the fill status of the marker.

### Fix Strategy
To fix this bug, we need to implement the `is_filled` method in the `MarkerStyle` class correctly. This method should return the value of the `_filled` attribute which determines whether the marker is filled or not. Additionally, we need to ensure that the `MarkerStyle` class contains the necessary methods to properly handle marker properties like fillstyle.

### Corrected Version
```python
class MarkerStyle:
    # Correcting the missing is_filled method
    def is_filled(self):
        return self._filled
    
    def _recache(self):
        if self._marker_function is None:
            return
        self._path = _empty_path
        self._transform = IdentityTransform()
        self._alt_path = None
        self._alt_transform = None
        self._snap_threshold = None
        self._joinstyle = 'round'
        self._capstyle = 'butt'
        self._filled = True

# Example usage of the corrected MarkerStyle class
test_marker_fillstyle():
    marker_style = markers.MarkerStyle(marker='o', fillstyle='none')
    assert marker_style.get_fillstyle() == 'none'
    assert not marker_style.is_filled()
``` 

By implementing the `is_filled` method correctly in the `MarkerStyle` class, the corrected version should now pass the failing test by correctly handling the fill status of the marker.
