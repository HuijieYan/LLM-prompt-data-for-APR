### Potential Error Locations
1. The `_marker_function` attribute might not be set correctly, leading to a None value. This could result in the method not being called as intended.
2. The `is_filled` method might not be implemented or functioning as expected. This could cause the assertion error when checking if the marker is filled.

### Bug Explanation
The bug in the `_recache` function lies in the incorrect handling of the `_marker_function` attribute. If this attribute is None, the function returns without performing necessary operations, leading to unexpected behavior in the rest of the code. Additionally, the implementation of the `is_filled` method is causing an assertion error because it is returning the incorrect result.

### Fix Strategy
1. Set the correct `_marker_function` attribute or ensure that it is properly initialized in the `MarkerStyle` class.
2. Check and fix the implementation of the `is_filled` method to return the correct result based on the filled property of the marker.

### Corrected Version
```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: lib/matplotlib/markers.py

# The declaration of the class containing the corrected function
class MarkerStyle():
    def _recache(self):
        if self._marker_function is not None:
            self._path = _empty_path
            self._transform = IdentityTransform()
            self._alt_path = None
            self._alt_transform = None
            self._snap_threshold = None
            self._joinstyle = 'round'
            self._capstyle = 'butt'
            self._filled = True
            self._marker_function()
    
    def is_filled(self):
        return self._filled
```

By ensuring that the `_marker_function` attribute is properly set and fixing the implementation of the `is_filled` method, the corrected version of the `_recache` function should function as intended and pass the failing test.
