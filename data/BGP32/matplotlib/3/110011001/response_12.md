### Analysis:
- The `MarkerStyle` class has a method `_recache` that is responsible for updating certain attributes of the class instance.
- The failing test is checking the `is_filled` method of `MarkerStyle` and expecting it to return `False`, but it is currently returning `True`.
- The `_recache` method sets the `_filled` attribute to `True` unconditionally.

### Bug:
The bug lies in the `_recache` method where the `_filled` attribute is always set to `True`, causing the `is_filled` method to return `True` regardless of the actual fill style specified.

### Fix:
To fix this bug, we need to update the `_recache` method to consider the fill style specified during the initialization of the `MarkerStyle` instance.

### Corrected Version:
```python
class MarkerStyle():
    def __init__(self, marker=None, fillstyle=None):
        self.marker = marker
        self.fillstyle = fillstyle
        self._recache()

    def _recache(self):
        if self._marker_function is None:
            return
        self._path = _empty_path
        self._transform = IdentityTransform()
        self._alt_path = None
        self._alt_transform = None
        self._snap_threshold = None
        self._joinstyle = 'round'
        self._capstyle = 'butt'
        self._filled = self.fillstyle is not None and self.fillstyle.lower() != 'none'
        self._marker_function()
```

With this correction, the `_filled` attribute will be set based on the provided `fillstyle`, and the `is_filled` method should now return the correct value according to the fill style specified.
