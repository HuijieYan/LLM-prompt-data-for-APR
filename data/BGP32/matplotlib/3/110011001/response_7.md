### Analyzing the buggy function
The function `_recache` within the `MarkerStyle` class is causing the test to fail. This function is intended to reset certain attributes of `MarkerStyle` to default values before reevaluating the marker style. However, the bug seems to be related to the following line in the function:
```python
self._marker_function()
```
This line is calling a method that is supposed to update the marker's properties, but it is not correctly updating the `_filled` attribute.

### Identifying potential error locations
1. The `_marker_function` method may not be correctly updating the `_filled` attribute.
2. The `is_filled` method may not be working as expected, leading to incorrect assertions in the test.

### Cause of the bug
The bug is likely due to the `_marker_function` method not updating the `_filled` attribute or the `is_filled` method not correctly reflecting the value of `_filled`. This leads to the failing test assert not being True.

### Strategy for fixing the bug
1. Check the implementation of the `_marker_function` method to ensure it properly updates the `_filled` attribute.
2. Verify the implementation of the `is_filled` method to correctly return the value of `_filled`.

### Corrected version of the function
```python
class MarkerStyle():
    def _recache(self):
        if self._marker_function is not None:
            self._path = _empty_path
            self._transform = IdentityTransform()
            self._alt_path = None
            self._alt_transform = None
            self._snap_threshold = None
            self._joinstyle = 'round'
            self._capstyle = 'butt'
            self._filled = True
            self._marker_function()
``` 

By modifying the condition to check if `_marker_function` is not None before calling it, the bug should be fixed. Make sure that the `_marker_function` method correctly updates the `_filled` attribute, and the `is_filled` method correctly reflects the value of `_filled`.
