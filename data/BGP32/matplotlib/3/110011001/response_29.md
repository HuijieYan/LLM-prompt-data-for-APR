### Analysis
The failing test is checking the `is_filled` method of the `MarkerStyle` class, which should return `False` when the marker style is set to `'none'`. However, the `_recache` method of the `MarkerStyle` class is not properly updating the `_filled` attribute based on the fillstyle passed to the class constructor.

The `_recache` method is setting `_filled` to `True` by default, and there is no logic to update it based on the fillstyle provided during initialization.

### Bug Cause
The bug is caused by not updating the `_filled` attribute based on the fillstyle provided when constructing an instance of `MarkerStyle`.

### Fix
To fix the bug, we need to update the `_filled` attribute based on the fillstyle provided during initialization. If the fillstyle is set to `'none'`, `_filled` should be set to `False`.

### Corrected Version
```python
class MarkerStyle():
    def __init__(self, marker=None, fillstyle='full'):
        self._marker = marker
        self._fillstyle = fillstyle
        if fillstyle == 'none':
            self._filled = False
        else:
            self._filled = True

    def _recache(self):
        if self._marker is None:
            return
        self._path = _empty_path
        self._transform = IdentityTransform()
        self._alt_path = None
        self._alt_transform = None
        self._snap_threshold = None
        self._joinstyle = 'round'
        self._capstyle = 'butt'
        self._marker_function()

    def is_filled(self):
        return self._filled

    def get_fillstyle(self):
        return self._fillstyle
``` 

By updating the `_filled` attribute in the constructor based on the fillstyle provided, the corrected version of the `MarkerStyle` class should now pass the failing test.
