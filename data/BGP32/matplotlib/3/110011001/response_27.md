### Bug Explanation
The buggy function `_recache` in the `MarkerStyle` class fails to correctly update the `_filled` attribute based on the input parameters provided during the initialization of the `MarkerStyle` object. This results in the `is_filled()` method returning an incorrect value, leading to the failing test case.

The `_filled` attribute is set to `True` unconditionally in the `_recache` function, which does not take into account the `fillstyle` parameter provided during the initialization of the `MarkerStyle` object. As a result, the `is_filled()` method does not accurately reflect whether the marker should be filled or not.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug
To fix the bug, we need to update the `_filled` attribute based on the `fillstyle` parameter during the object initialization. This will ensure that the `is_filled()` method returns the correct value based on the provided `fillstyle`.

### Corrected Version of the Function
```python
class MarkerStyle():

    def __init__(self, marker='', fillstyle='full'):
        self._marker = marker
        self._fillstyle = fillstyle
        self._marker_function = None
        self._recache()

    def _recache(self):
        if self._marker_function is None:
            return
        self._path = _empty_path
        self._transform = IdentityTransform()
        self._alt_path = None
        self._alt_transform = None
        self._snap_threshold = None
        self._joinstyle = 'round'
        self._capstyle = 'butt'
        self._filled = self._fillstyle != 'none'
        self._marker_function()
```

In the corrected version, the `_filled` attribute is set based on the `fillstyle` parameter provided during object initialization. This ensures that the `is_filled()` method accurately reflects whether the marker should be filled or not.
