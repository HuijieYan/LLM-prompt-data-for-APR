### Fixing the buggy function

#### Cause of the bug:
The bug in the `_recache` function is that it is invoking `self._marker_function()` without checking if the `self._marker_function` attribute is actually a function. This causes an error when `self._marker_function` is `None`, as it tries to call `None` as a function.

#### Strategy for fixing the bug:
To fix the bug, we need to add a check to ensure that `self._marker_function` is not `None` before trying to call it.

#### Corrected version of the buggy function:
```python
class MarkerStyle():

    def _recache(self):
        if self._marker_function is not None and callable(self._marker_function):
            self._path = _empty_path
            self._transform = IdentityTransform()
            self._alt_path = None
            self._alt_transform = None
            self._snap_threshold = None
            self._joinstyle = 'round'
            self._capstyle = 'butt'
            self._filled = True
            self._marker_function()
``` 

By adding the additional condition `if self._marker_function is not None and callable(self._marker_function):`, we ensure that we only call `self._marker_function` if it exists and is actually callable. This prevents the error from occurring and should fix the failing test.
