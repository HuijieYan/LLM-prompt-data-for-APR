### Analysis
The buggy function `_recache` is meant to reset certain attributes of the `MarkerStyle` class to their default values. The issue in this function is that it's trying to call `self._marker_function()` without checking if `_marker_function` is defined, which results in an AttributeError when `self._marker_function` is `None`.

### Error
The error occurs because `self._marker_function` is `None`, and the function is called without checking for its existence, leading to an AttributeError.

### Fix
To fix this bug, we need to add a check to verify if `self._marker_function` is not `None` before calling it. If it is `None`, we should skip calling it to avoid the AttributeError.

### Corrected Version
```python
class MarkerStyle():
    def _recache(self):
        if self._marker_function is not None:
            self._path = _empty_path
            self._transform = IdentityTransform()
            self._alt_path = None
            self._alt_transform = None
            self._snap_threshold = None
            self._joinstyle = 'round'
            self._capstyle = 'butt'
            self._filled = True
            self._marker_function()
```
