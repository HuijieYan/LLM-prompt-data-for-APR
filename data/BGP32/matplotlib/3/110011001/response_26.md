### Bug Explanation
The buggy function `_recache` is failing because the `_marker_function` is being called without checking if it exists, which can lead to an AttributeError when trying to call a method that does not exist. This behavior is causing the assertion `assert not marker_style.is_filled()` to fail because the `_filled` attribute is set to `True` by default, but the `_marker_function` is not defined to update it accordingly.

### Fix Strategy
To fix this bug, we should add a condition to check if the `_marker_function` exists before trying to call it. Additionally, ensure that the `_marker_function` updates the `_filled` attribute as needed for different marker styles.

### Corrected Version
```python
class MarkerStyle():
    def _recache(self):
        if self._marker_function is not None:
            self._path = _empty_path
            self._transform = IdentityTransform()
            self._alt_path = None
            self._alt_transform = None
            self._snap_threshold = None
            self._joinstyle = 'round'
            self._capstyle = 'butt'
            self._filled = self._marker_function(fill=self._filled)
``` 

In this corrected version, we added a conditional statement to check if `_marker_function` is not `None` before calling it. We also passed the `fill` argument to `_marker_function` to update the `_filled` attribute based on the marker style.
