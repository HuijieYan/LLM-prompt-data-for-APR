### Analyzing the buggy function
The `_recache` function in the `MarkerStyle` class is intended to reset certain attributes to default values before recalculating the marker. However, there seems to be a bug where the `_marker_function` is called without checking if it is None, which causes an error in certain test cases.

### Potential error location
The potential error is in the line:
```python
self._marker_function()
```

### Cause of the bug
The cause of the bug is that the function is calling `self._marker_function()` without checking if `self._marker_function` is `None` or not. This results in an AttributeError when trying to call the `is_filled` method on `MarkerStyle` object, leading to the test failure.

### Strategy for fixing the bug
To fix the bug, we should check if `self._marker_function` is not `None` before calling it.

### The corrected version
```python
class MarkerStyle():
    def _recache(self):
        if self._marker_function is not None:
            self._path = _empty_path
            self._transform = IdentityTransform()
            self._alt_path = None
            self._alt_transform = None
            self._snap_threshold = None
            self._joinstyle = 'round'
            self._capstyle = 'butt'
            self._filled = True
            self._marker_function()
```

By adding the `if self._marker_function is not None` check, we ensure that the `_marker_function` is only called if it is defined, preventing the AttributeError and resolving the issue with the failing test.
