### Analysis
The buggy function `_recache` is not correctly updating the `_filled` attribute based on the value returned by the `_marker_function`. This is causing the `is_filled` method to return an incorrect result in the failing test case.

### Bug Explanation
The buggy function does not update the `_filled` attribute based on the return value of `_marker_function`, resulting in the `is_filled` method not reflecting the correct fill status of the marker.

### Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the `_filled` attribute is updated based on the return value of `_marker_function`.

### Corrected Version of the Function

```python
class MarkerStyle():

    def _recache(self):
        if self._marker_function is None:
            return
        self._path = _empty_path
        self._transform = IdentityTransform()
        self._alt_path = None
        self._alt_transform = None
        self._snap_threshold = None
        self._joinstyle = 'round'
        self._capstyle = 'butt'
        self._filled = self._marker_function()
``` 

By updating the `_filled` attribute with the return value of `_marker_function`, the corrected version of the function ensures that the fill status of the marker reflects the correct value, fixing the bug.
