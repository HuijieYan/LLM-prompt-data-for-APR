### Analysis
- The `_recache` function in the `MarkerStyle` class is failing to correctly update the `_filled` attribute based on the marker's fillstyle.
- The failing test checks if the marker is filled or not, and it fails because the `_filled` attribute is always set to `True` within the `_recache` function.

### Bug
The bug lies in the `_recache` function not properly updating the `_filled` attribute based on the fillstyle of the marker.

### Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to update the `_filled` attribute based on the fillstyle provided during the marker creation.

### Corrected Version

```python
class MarkerStyle():
    def __init__(self, marker='o', fillstyle='full'):
        self._marker = marker
        self._fillstyle = fillstyle
        self._marker_function = None
        # initialize filled based on fillstyle
        self._filled = fillstyle != 'none'
    
    def _recache(self):
        if self._marker_function is None:
            return
        self._path = _empty_path
        self._transform = IdentityTransform()
        self._alt_path = None
        self._alt_transform = None
        self._snap_threshold = None
        self._joinstyle = 'round'
        self._capstyle = 'butt'
        # update filled based on fillstyle
        self._filled = self._fillstyle != 'none'
        self._marker_function()
``` 

By updating the `_filled` attribute based on the fillstyle provided during the marker creation, the corrected version of the function ensures that the marker's filled status is correctly reflected. This should resolve the failing test case.
