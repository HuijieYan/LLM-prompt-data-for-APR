### Analysis
The `_recache` function in the `MarkerStyle` class is not correctly setting the `_filled` attribute based on the value returned by the `_marker_function` method. This results in the `is_filled` method not returning the expected value in the failing test.

### Bug Cause
The bug occurs because the `_filled` attribute is set to `True` unconditionally within the `_recache` function, regardless of the return value of the `_marker_function`. This leads to the `is_filled` method always returning `False`, causing the test to fail.

### Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to update the `_recache` function to set the `_filled` attribute based on the return value of the `_marker_function`.

### Corrected Version
```python
# The declaration of the class containing the corrected function
class MarkerStyle():
    
    def _recache(self):
        if self._marker_function is None:
            return
        self._path = _empty_path
        self._transform = IdentityTransform()
        self._alt_path = None
        self._alt_transform = None
        self._snap_threshold = None
        self._joinstyle = 'round'
        self._capstyle = 'butt'
        self._filled = self._marker_function()
``` 

By updating the `_filled` attribute to the return value of `_marker_function`, we ensure that it reflects the correct filled status based on the marker function. This correction should enable the `is_filled` method to return the expected result, passing the failing test.
