### Analysis
- The `_recache` method of the `MarkerStyle` class is not correctly assigning the result of the `_marker_function` to a variable or utilizing it in any way.
- The failing test is checking if the marker is filled or not, but due to the incorrect implementation, it is always returning `True`, leading to the assertion error.
- The `_filled` variable is always set to `True` at the end of the function, regardless of the `_marker_function` result.

### Bug Cause
The bug is caused by the lack of proper handling of the `_marker_function` result. The `_filled` variable is always being set to `True` at the end of the function, leading to incorrect behavior when checking if the marker is filled or not.

### Fix Strategy
1. Store the result of the `_marker_function`.
2. Use the stored result to determine the `_filled` status of the marker.

### Corrected Version
```python
class MarkerStyle():
    
    def _recache(self):
        if self._marker_function is None:
            return
        
        self._path = _empty_path
        self._transform = IdentityTransform()
        self._alt_path = None
        self._alt_transform = None
        self._snap_threshold = None
        self._joinstyle = 'round'
        self._capstyle = 'butt'

        result = self._marker_function()
        if result is not None:
            self._filled = result
```

With this correction, the `_filled` variable will now be assigned the correct value based on the result of the `_marker_function`, fixing the bug and allowing the failing test to pass.
