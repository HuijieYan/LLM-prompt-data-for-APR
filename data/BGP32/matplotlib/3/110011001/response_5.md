### Analysis
The buggy function `_recache` in the `MarkerStyle` class is failing the test because it doesn't correctly handle the case when the `_marker_function` attribute is `None`. In this case, it should return without executing `_marker_function`.

### Bug Cause
The buggy function always attempts to call `_marker_function` without checking if it exists. This results in an AttributeError when trying to call a `None` object as a function. This causes the failing test as the expected behavior is not met.

### Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to add a check to see if `_marker_function` is not `None` before attempting to call it. If it is `None`, we should return from the function without executing it.

### Corrected Version
```python
class MarkerStyle():

    def _recache(self):
        if self._marker_function is None:
            return
        self._path = _empty_path
        self._transform = IdentityTransform()
        self._alt_path = None
        self._alt_transform = None
        self._snap_threshold = None
        self._joinstyle = 'round'
        self._capstyle = 'butt'
        self._filled = True
        self._marker_function()
``` 

This corrected version of the function will check if `_marker_function` is not `None` before calling it, effectively fixing the bug.
