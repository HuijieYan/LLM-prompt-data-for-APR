### Analysis
The error message indicates that the `is_filled()` method of the `MarkerStyle` class is returning `True`, but the test expected it to return `False`. This suggests that the `_filled` attribute is not being set correctly in the `_recache()` function.

Looking at the code in the `_recache()` function, we can see that `_filled` is always set to `True`, but there is no logic that allows this attribute to be changed. This means that no matter what the initial value of `_filled` is, it will always be set to `True` during the `_recache()` process.

### Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the `_filled` attribute is correctly set based on the `fillstyle` provided during the initialization of the `MarkerStyle` object. We should modify the `_recache()` function to take into account the `fillstyle` parameter and set the `_filled` attribute accordingly.

### Corrected Version
```python
class MarkerStyle():
    def __init__(self, marker='o', fillstyle='full'):
        self._marker_function = None
        self.fillstyle = fillstyle

    def is_filled(self):
        return self.fillstyle != 'none'

    def _recache(self):
        if self._marker_function is None:
            return
        self._path = _empty_path
        self._transform = IdentityTransform()
        self._alt_path = None
        self._alt_transform = None
        self._snap_threshold = None
        self._joinstyle = 'round'
        self._capstyle = 'butt'
        self._filled = self.fillstyle != 'none'
        self._marker_function()
``` 

By modifying the `MarkerStyle` class to consider the `fillstyle` parameter during initialization, we ensure that the `_filled` attribute is correctly set in the `_recache()` function based on the `fillstyle` value.
