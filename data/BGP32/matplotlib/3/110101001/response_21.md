### Analysis
The `_recache` function in the `MarkerStyle` class is supposed to reset certain attributes to default values and then call the `_marker_function` if it is not `None`. However, based on the failing test, it seems that the `_filled` attribute is not being properly reset to `False` even though it should be.

### Bug Explanation
The bug seems to be in the assignment of `self._filled = True` within the `_recache` function. This assignment should be setting `self._filled` to `False` to match the expected behavior when the `fillstyle` is set to `'none'` in the failing test. This incorrect assignment is causing the failing test.

### Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to change the assignment of `self._filled` to `False` instead of `True`. This will ensure that the `is_filled()` function returns the expected value when `fillstyle` is set to `'none'`.

### Corrected Version
```python
class MarkerStyle():

    def _recache(self):
        if self._marker_function is None:
            return
        self._path = _empty_path
        self._transform = IdentityTransform()
        self._alt_path = None
        self._alt_transform = None
        self._snap_threshold = None
        self._joinstyle = 'round'
        self._capstyle = 'butt'
        self._filled = False  # Fix: setting _filled to False instead of True
        self._marker_function()
```
