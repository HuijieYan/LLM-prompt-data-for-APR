### Analysis:
The `_recache` function in the `MarkerStyle` class initializes various attributes including `_path`, `_transform`, `_alt_path`, `_alt_transform`, `_snap_threshold`, `_joinstyle`, `_capstyle` and `_filled`. However, it fails to properly invoke the `_marker_function` method if it exists.

### Bug Cause:
The bug occurs because the `_marker_function` method is not being called appropriately in the `_recache` function, potentially leading to inconsistencies in the MarkerStyle object's state.

### Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the `_marker_function` method is called correctly within the `_recache` function after setting the initial attributes.

### Corrected Version:
```python
class MarkerStyle:
    def _recache(self):
        if self._marker_function is None:
            return
        self._path = _empty_path
        self._transform = IdentityTransform()
        self._alt_path = None
        self._alt_transform = None
        self._snap_threshold = np.inf
        self._joinstyle = 'round'
        self._capstyle = 'butt'
        self._filled = True
        self._marker_function()
```

By including the `_marker_function()` method call after setting the initial attributes, the corrected version of the function should now properly update the MarkerStyle object's state.
