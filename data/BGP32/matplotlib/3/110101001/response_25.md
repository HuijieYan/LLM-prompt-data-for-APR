### Analysis:
The buggy function `_recache` in the `MarkerStyle` class fails to properly handle the case when the `self._marker_function` is not None. The function resets several attributes of the `MarkerStyle` instance unconditionally and then calls the `_marker_function` without any condition check. This can lead to unexpected behavior and potentially break the functionality of the `MarkerStyle` class.

### Bug Cause:
The bug causes the `_recache` function to reset the attributes regardless of the validity of the `_marker_function`. In the failing test, the `MarkerStyle` instance is being created with a specific `fillstyle`, and the test expects the `get_fillstyle` method to return the correct value. However, since `_recache` unconditionally resets attributes before calling `_marker_function`, it might override the `fillstyle` set during the instance creation.

### Bug Fix:
To fix the bug, we need to modify the `_recache` function to check if `_marker_function` is not None before resetting the attributes and calling the function. If `_marker_function` is None, we can safely return without making any changes. Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
class MarkerStyle():
    def _recache(self):
        if self._marker_function is None:
            return
        self._path = _empty_path
        self._transform = IdentityTransform()
        self._alt_path = None
        self._alt_transform = None
        self._snap_threshold = None
        self._joinstyle = 'round'
        self._capstyle = 'butt'
        self._filled = True
        self._marker_function()
```

By adding the condition to check for None `_marker_function`, we ensure that the function behaves as expected and does not override attributes unnecessarily. This fix should address the failing test case.
