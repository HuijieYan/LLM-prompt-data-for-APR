### Analysis
The `_recache` function in the `MarkerStyle` class is responsible for resetting certain attributes to default values and then calling a marker function. However, there seems to be an issue with the logic in the function that might prevent it from properly setting up the attributes.

### Bug
The bug is likely in the `if self._marker_function is None:` check. If the condition is not met, it will skip the attribute reset and directly call `self._marker_function()`, which might lead to unexpected behavior.

### Fix Strategy
To fix this bug, we need to revise the logic of the `_recache` function to properly reset the attributes regardless of the existence of a `_marker_function`. This will ensure that the attributes are correctly set to their default values before any further operations.

### Corrected Version
```python
class MarkerStyle():
    def _recache(self):
        self._path = _empty_path
        self._transform = IdentityTransform()
        self._alt_path = None
        self._alt_transform = None
        self._snap_threshold = None
        self._joinstyle = 'round'
        self._capstyle = 'butt'
        self._filled = True
        
        if self._marker_function is not None:
            self._marker_function()
```

By restructuring the `if-else` logic, we ensure that the attributes are reset first and then the `_marker_function` is called if it exists. This should address the bug and make the function behave as intended.
