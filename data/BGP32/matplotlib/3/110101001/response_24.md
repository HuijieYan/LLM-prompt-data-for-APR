### Analysis:
The buggy function `_recache` in the `MarkerStyle` class is setting some internal variables to default values and then calling a marker function without checking if it exists or is initialized properly. This can lead to issues when the `_marker_function` is not defined.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is caused by the line `self._marker_function()` being called without proper checks on its existence or initialization. This can lead to errors if the `_marker_function` is not properly defined.

### Bug Fix:
To fix the bug, we need to add a check to ensure that `_marker_function` is not `None` before calling it. If it is `None`, the function should exit early without making any changes.

### Corrected Code:
```python
class MarkerStyle():
    def _recache(self):
        if self._marker_function is None:
            return
        self._path = _empty_path
        self._transform = IdentityTransform()
        self._alt_path = None
        self._alt_transform = None
        self._snap_threshold = None
        self._joinstyle = 'round'
        self._capstyle = 'butt'
        self._filled = True
        self._marker_function()
``` 

Applying this fix will ensure that the `_marker_function` is only called if it is properly initialized, preventing any potential errors.
