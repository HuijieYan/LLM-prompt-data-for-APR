### Explanation:
The buggy function `_recache` initializes some attributes of the `MarkerStyle` class, including `_path`, `_snap_threshold`, `_joinstyle`, `_capstyle`, and `_filled`. However, it calls the `_marker_function` method without checking if it is defined, which can lead to an error if `_marker_function` is not assigned.

In the failing test `test_marker_fillstyle`, the `MarkerStyle` object is instantiated with `marker='o'` and `fillstyle='none'`. The test checks if the `fillstyle` attribute is correctly set to `'none'` and if the marker is not filled.

The issue arises because the `_marker_function` is not defined in the buggy function, causing an AttributeError when attempting to call it.

### Strategy for fixing the bug:
We need to ensure that the `_marker_function` is defined and callable before invoking it in the `_recache` function. This can be achieved by adding a `if self._marker_function is not None:` condition before calling `_marker_function()`.

### The corrected version of the buggy function:
```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: lib/matplotlib/markers.py

# The corrected version of the buggy function
class MarkerStyle():
    def _recache(self):
        if self._marker_function is not None:
            self._path = _empty_path
            self._transform = IdentityTransform()
            self._alt_path = None
            self._alt_transform = None
            self._snap_threshold = None
            self._joinstyle = 'round'
            self._capstyle = 'butt'
            self._filled = True
            self._marker_function()
```

By adding the condition to check if `_marker_function` is defined before calling it, the corrected version of the function should now pass the failing test `test_marker_fillstyle`.
