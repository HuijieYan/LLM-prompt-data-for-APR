### Analysis
The `_recache` function in the `MarkerStyle` class is supposed to update certain attributes based on the `_marker_function`. However, there is a potential issue where the `_marker_function` is being called without checking if it exists. This could lead to errors if `_marker_function` is not defined or is `None`.

### Bug Explanation
In the provided runtime values and types, it is evident that the `_marker_function` check is missing before calling `self._marker_function()`. If `_marker_function` is `None`, this call will raise an error, causing the test to fail.

### Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to include a check to ensure that `_marker_function` is not `None` before calling it. This will prevent any errors that might arise from calling a `None` object.

### Corrected Version
```python
class MarkerStyle():

    def _recache(self):
        if self._marker_function is None:
            return
        self._path = _empty_path
        self._transform = IdentityTransform()
        self._alt_path = None
        self._alt_transform = None
        self._snap_threshold = None
        self._joinstyle = 'round'
        self._capstyle = 'butt'
        self._filled = True
        if self._marker_function:
            self._marker_function()
```

By including the `if self._marker_function is not None` check before calling `self._marker_function()`, we ensure that the function is only executed if it actually exists, avoiding any potential errors. This correction should make the failing test pass successfully.
