### Explanation:
The buggy function `_recache` is failing because it assumes that the `_marker_function` attribute exists and is callable. However, in the failing test scenario, the `_marker_function` is None, which leads to a `TypeError` when trying to call it.

### Strategy for fixing the bug:
To fix the bug, we need to check if `_marker_function` is not None before attempting to call it.

### The corrected version of the buggy function:
```python
class MarkerStyle():
    def _recache(self):
        if self._marker_function is not None:
            self._path = _empty_path
            self._transform = IdentityTransform()
            self._alt_path = None
            self._alt_transform = None
            self._snap_threshold = None
            self._joinstyle = 'round'
            self._capstyle = 'butt'
            self._filled = True
            self._marker_function()
```

By adding a check for `_marker_function is not None` before calling `_marker_function()`, the bug should be fixed, and the failing test `test_marker_fillstyle()` should pass.
