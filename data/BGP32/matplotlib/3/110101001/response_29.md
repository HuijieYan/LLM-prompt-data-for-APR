### Analysis
The buggy function `_recache` in the `MarkerStyle` class is supposed to re-cache specific attributes of the MarkerStyle instance. However, it seems that there is a mistake in how the `_marker_function` is called within the function.

### Error Location
The issue arises when calling `self._marker_function()` without checking if it exists or not. This could potentially lead to an exception if `_marker_function` is not defined.

### Cause of the Bug
The bug is caused by blindly invoking `self._marker_function()` without verifying its existence. This can lead to a `TypeError` if `_marker_function` is `None`.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug
To fix this bug, we need to add a check to ensure that `_marker_function` is not `None` before attempting to call it. This way, we can avoid the potential `TypeError`.

### Corrected Version
```python
class MarkerStyle():
    def _recache(self):
        if self._marker_function is not None:
            self._path = _empty_path
            self._transform = IdentityTransform()
            self._alt_path = None
            self._alt_transform = None
            self._snap_threshold = None
            self._joinstyle = 'round'
            self._capstyle = 'butt'
            self._filled = True
            self._marker_function()
```

By making this change, the corrected version of the `_recache` function should now properly check the existence of `_marker_function` before invoking it, preventing the potential issue of calling `None`. This corrected version should pass the failing test provided.
