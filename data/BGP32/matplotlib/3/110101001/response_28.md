### Analysis
The buggy function `_recache` in the `MarkerStyle` class is missing the assignment of a marker function to `self._marker_function`, which causes an error when trying to execute `self._marker_function()`. This leads to the function not properly initializing the attributes of the `MarkerStyle` instance, resulting in failures in tests that rely on those attributes.

### Bug Cause
The bug is caused by not assigning a marker function to `self._marker_function`, leading to a `None` value for `_marker_function`. As a result, the function attempts to call `None`, causing an error and preventing the proper initialization of the `MarkerStyle` attributes.

### Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that a valid marker function is assigned to `self._marker_function`. This can be done by passing the marker function as an argument when creating a `MarkerStyle` instance.

### Corrected Version
```python
class MarkerStyle():
    def __init__(self, marker_function=None):
        self._marker_function = marker_function
    
    def _recache(self):
        if self._marker_function is None:
            return
        self._path = _empty_path
        self._transform = IdentityTransform()
        self._alt_path = None
        self._alt_transform = None
        self._snap_threshold = None
        self._joinstyle = 'round'
        self._capstyle = 'butt'
        self._filled = True
        self._marker_function()
```

By modifying the `MarkerStyle` class to accept a `marker_function` parameter in its constructor and assigning it to `self._marker_function`, we ensure that a valid function is available for execution in the `_recache` method. This correction should resolve the bug and allow the failing test to pass.
