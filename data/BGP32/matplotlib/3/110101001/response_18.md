### Bug Explanation
The bug in the `_recache` function lies in the line `self._marker_function()` where it attempts to call the `_marker_function` attribute without checking if it is actually defined. This can lead to a `NoneType` object error if `_marker_function` is not initialized properly.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to add a check to ensure that `_marker_function` is not `None` before attempting to call it. This will prevent the error and ensure the function operates correctly.

### Corrected Version of the Function
```python
# The corrected version of the buggy function
class MarkerStyle():
    def _recache(self):
        if self._marker_function is None:
            return
        self._path = _empty_path
        self._transform = IdentityTransform()
        self._alt_path = None
        self._alt_transform = None
        self._snap_threshold = None
        self._joinstyle = 'round'
        self._capstyle = 'butt'
        self._filled = True
        if self._marker_function:
            self._marker_function()
``` 

By adding the check `if self._marker_function is not None:` before calling `self._marker_function()`, we ensure that the function is only called if it is defined, avoiding any errors related to `NoneType` objects. Now the corrected function should work properly without throwing errors.
