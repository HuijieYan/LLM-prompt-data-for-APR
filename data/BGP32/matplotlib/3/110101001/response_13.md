### Explanation:
The bug in the `_recache` function is that it assumes the `_marker_function` attribute is always callable before invoking it. However, in the failing test scenario, the `_marker_function` is not defined, leading to an AttributeError when trying to call it.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to check if `_marker_function` is not None before attempting to call it to avoid the AttributeError.

### The corrected version of the buggy function:
```python
class MarkerStyle():
    def _recache(self):
        if self._marker_function is not None:
            self._path = _empty_path
            self._transform = IdentityTransform()
            self._alt_path = None
            self._alt_transform = None
            self._snap_threshold = None
            self._joinstyle = 'round'
            self._capstyle = 'butt'
            self._filled = True
            self._marker_function()
```
