The bug in the `_recache` function of the `MarkerStyle` class is that it is trying to call a marker function without checking if it exists or not. This causes an AttributeError when trying to call a non-existent function.

### Bug Explanation:
The `_recache` function tries to call `self._marker_function()` without verifying if `_marker_function` is actually set to a function. This results in an AttributeError when `_marker_function` is `None`.

### Fix Strategy:
To fix this bug, we should check if `_marker_function` is not `None` before attempting to call it. If `_marker_function` is `None`, we should simply return without performing any further actions.

### Corrected Version:
Here is the corrected version of the `_recache` function:

```python
class MarkerStyle():

    def _recache(self):
        if self._marker_function is None:
            return
        self._path = _empty_path
        self._transform = IdentityTransform()
        self._alt_path = None
        self._alt_transform = None
        self._snap_threshold = None
        self._joinstyle = 'round'
        self._capstyle = 'butt'
        self._filled = True
        self._marker_function()
```

With this fix, the `_recache` function will only call `_marker_function` if it is not `None`, preventing the AttributeError.
