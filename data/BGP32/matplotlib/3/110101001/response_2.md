The issue with the `_recache` function is that it is trying to call `self._marker_function` without checking if it exists. This can cause a `NoneType` object error if `_marker_function` is not defined.

To fix the bug, we need to add a check to ensure that `_marker_function` is not `None` before calling it. Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: lib/matplotlib/markers.py

# The declaration of the class containing the corrected function
class MarkerStyle():

    def _recache(self):
        if self._marker_function is not None:
            self._path = _empty_path
            self._transform = IdentityTransform()
            self._alt_path = None
            self._alt_transform = None
            self._snap_threshold = None
            self._joinstyle = 'round'
            self._capstyle = 'butt'
            self._filled = True
            self._marker_function()
```

By adding this check, the function will only call `_marker_function` if it exists, preventing the `NoneType` object error. This corrected version should now pass the failing test.
