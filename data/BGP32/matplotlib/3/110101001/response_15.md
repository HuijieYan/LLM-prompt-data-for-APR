### Analysis
The `_recache` function in the `MarkerStyle` class is supposed to reinitialize certain attributes but seems to be missing a check for the `_marker_function` attribute before calling it.

### Bug Explanation
In the provided case, the `_marker_function` attribute is being checked for `None` before calling it. However, if `self._marker_function` is `None`, the function should simply return without attempting to call `self._marker_function()`. The test may fail because the function is trying to call a `None` object.

### Bug Fix
To fix the bug, we need to add a check to ensure that `self._marker_function` is not `None` before calling it. Here is the corrected version of the `_recache` function:

```python
class MarkerStyle():
    def _recache(self):
        if self._marker_function is None:
            return
        self._path = _empty_path
        self._transform = IdentityTransform()
        self._alt_path = None
        self._alt_transform = None
        self._snap_threshold = None
        self._joinstyle = 'round'
        self._capstyle = 'butt'
        self._filled = True
        self._marker_function()
```

This fix ensures that the `_marker_function` is only called when it is not `None`, which should resolve the bug and make the failing test pass.
