### Analysis
- The buggy function `_recache` is supposed to recalculate certain attributes of a `MarkerStyle` object.
- The function sets the `_path` attribute to `_empty_path`, which is not defined in the code snippet provided.
- The function sets `_snap_threshold`, `_joinstyle`, `_capstyle`, and `_filled` attributes to default values.
- The critical issue lies in the line `self._marker_function()`. This line calls an undefined function, leading to a `NameError`.
- Since the `_marker_function` is not defined in the snippet, it causes the failing test as the function cannot be executed.

### Bug Cause
The bug is caused by the undefined function `_marker_function` being called in the `_recache` function, resulting in a `NameError`.

### Bug Fix Strategy
1. Remove the call to `_marker_function` as it is not defined in the given snippet.
2. Make sure all attributes have proper default values or references where necessary.

### Corrected Version
```python
class MarkerStyle():
    def _recache(self):
        if self._marker_function is None:
            return
        self._path = _empty_path  # assuming _empty_path is correctly defined
        self._transform = IdentityTransform()
        self._alt_path = None
        self._alt_transform = None
        self._snap_threshold = float('inf')  # Set snap threshold to infinity
        self._joinstyle = 'round'
        self._capstyle = 'butt'
        self._filled = True
```
