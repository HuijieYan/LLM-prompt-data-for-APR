### Analysis:
The `self._marker_function` is called without checking if it is a valid function, which may lead to unexpected behavior or errors.

### Bug Cause:
The bug occurs because the `_marker_function` is called without validation, which may lead to issues when trying to execute an invalid or missing function.

### Fix Strategy:
Add a check to verify if `_marker_function` exists before calling it to prevent potential errors.

### Corrected Version:
```python
# The corrected version of the buggy function
class MarkerStyle():
    def _recache(self):
        if self._marker_function is not None and callable(self._marker_function):
            self._path = _empty_path
            self._transform = IdentityTransform()
            self._alt_path = None
            self._alt_transform = None
            self._snap_threshold = None
            self._joinstyle = 'round'
            self._capstyle = 'butt'
            self._filled = True
            self._marker_function()
```
