### Explanation:
The bug in the `_recache` function is that it is trying to call `self._marker_function()` without checking if `self._marker_function` is actually defined. This results in a `NoneType` object not callable error when the function is executed.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
We should add a check to see if `self._marker_function` is `None` before trying to call it.

### The Corrected Version of the Function:

```python
class MarkerStyle():

    def _recache(self):
        if self._marker_function is None:
            return
        
        self._path = _empty_path
        self._transform = IdentityTransform()
        self._alt_path = None
        self._alt_transform = None
        self._snap_threshold = None
        self._joinstyle = 'round'
        self._capstyle = 'butt'
        self._filled = True
        self._marker_function()
```
