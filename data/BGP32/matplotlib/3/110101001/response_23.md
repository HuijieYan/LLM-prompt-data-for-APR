### Bug Explanation
The buggy function `_recache` in the `MarkerStyle` class is supposed to update certain attributes based on the `_marker_function`. However, it fails to correctly update the `_filled` attribute which is crucial for determining if a marker is filled or not. As a result, the failing test `test_marker_fillstyle` is not passing because the `is_filled()` method is returning the incorrect result due to the `_filled` attribute not being updated properly.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the `_filled` attribute is updated correctly based on the `marker_function` in the `_recache` method. We should make sure that the value of `_filled` is correctly assigned so that the `is_filled()` method returns the expected result.

### Corrected Version of the Buggy Function
```python
class MarkerStyle():

    def _recache(self):
        if self._marker_function is None:
            return
        self._path = _empty_path
        self._transform = IdentityTransform()
        self._alt_path = None
        self._alt_transform = None
        self._snap_threshold = None
        self._joinstyle = 'round'
        self._capstyle = 'butt'
        self._filled = self._marker_function()  # Update the filled attribute
``` 

By updating the `_filled` attribute in the `_recache` method with the value returned from the `_marker_function`, we ensure that it reflects the correct filled state of the marker. This correction should address the issue seen in the failing test and ensure that the `is_filled()` method returns the expected result.
