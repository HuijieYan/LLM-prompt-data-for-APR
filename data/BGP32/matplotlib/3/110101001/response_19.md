### Bug Explanation
The bug in the `_recache` function arises from calling `self._marker_function()` without checking if `self._marker_function` is initialized. This can lead to unexpected behavior when the marker function is not set.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the `_marker_function` attribute is checked for `None` before calling it in the `_recache` function. This will prevent errors when the marker function is not properly initialized.

### Corrected Version
```python
class MarkerStyle():
    def _recache(self):
        if self._marker_function is not None:
            self._path = _empty_path
            self._transform = IdentityTransform()
            self._alt_path = None
            self._alt_transform = None
            self._snap_threshold = None
            self._joinstyle = 'round'
            self._capstyle = 'butt'
            self._filled = True
            self._marker_function()
``` 

Applying this fix should address the issue and ensure that the `_recache` function behaves as expected, preventing errors when the `_marker_function` is not initialized.
