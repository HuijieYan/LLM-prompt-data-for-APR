### Explanation:
The buggy function `_recache` is failing because it attempts to call `self._marker_function()` without checking if `_marker_function` is actually defined. This results in an AttributeError when `_marker_function` is None, causing the test to fail.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
1. Check if `_marker_function` is not None before attempting to call it.
2. If `_marker_function` is None, simply return from the function without executing it.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
class MarkerStyle():
    def _recache(self):
        if self._marker_function is None:
            return
        self._path = _empty_path
        self._transform = IdentityTransform()
        self._alt_path = None
        self._alt_transform = None
        self._snap_threshold = None
        self._joinstyle = 'round'
        self._capstyle = 'butt'
        self._filled = True
        self._marker_function()
``` 

With this fix, the test `test_marker_fillstyle` should pass successfully.
