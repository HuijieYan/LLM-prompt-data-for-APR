### Explanation
The buggy function `_recache` initializes the marker style attributes but fails to reassign the `_marker_function` correctly. This leads to a `NoneType` error when trying to call an object that is actually `None`.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that `_marker_function` is properly assigned before calling it in the `_recache` function.

### The corrected version of the buggy function
```python
class MarkerStyle():

    def _recache(self):
        if self._marker_function is not None:
            self._path = _empty_path
            self._transform = IdentityTransform()
            self._alt_path = None
            self._alt_transform = None
            self._snap_threshold = None
            self._joinstyle = 'round'
            self._capstyle = 'butt'
            self._filled = True
            self._marker_function()
``` 

By adding a conditional check before calling `_marker_function`, we ensure that it is only called if it exists, avoiding the `NoneType` error.
