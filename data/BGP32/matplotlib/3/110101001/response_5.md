### Bug Explanation
The `MarkerStyle` class has a method `_recache` that initializes some internal variables related to the marker style. In the provided code, the `self._marker_function()` is called without checking if it is defined, which can lead to a `NoneType` object not callable error if `self._marker_function` is `None`.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix this bug, we need to ensure that `self._marker_function` is not `None` before calling it in the `_recache` method.

### Corrected Version
```python
class MarkerStyle():
    def _recache(self):
        if self._marker_function is not None:
            self._path = _empty_path
            self._transform = IdentityTransform()
            self._alt_path = None
            self._alt_transform = None
            self._snap_threshold = None
            self._joinstyle = 'round'
            self._capstyle = 'butt'
            self._filled = True
            self._marker_function()
``` 

By adding the `if self._marker_function is not None` check before calling `self._marker_function()`, we ensure that the function is only called when it is actually defined, preventing the potential error.
