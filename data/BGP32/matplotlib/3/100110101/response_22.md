### Analysis:
The `_recache` function is supposed to update the internal attributes of a MarkerStyle object. However, in its current state, it fails to properly set the `_filled` attribute, leading to the failing test case `assert not marker_style.is_filled()`.

### Identification of potential error:
The issue lies in the line `self._filled = True` inside the `_recache` function. It should be set to `False` based on the expected values provided.

### Explanation of the bug:
The bug causes the `_filled` attribute to be set to `True` instead of `False`, which leads to the failing test case asserting the incorrect value.

### Strategy for fixing the bug:
The bug can be fixed simply by changing the assignment of `self._filled` to `False` instead of `True`.

### The corrected version of the function:
```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    self._filled = False  # Corrected assignment
    self._marker_function()
``` 

After making this change, the function should now correctly update the `_filled` attribute to `False`, resolving the bug and passing the failing test case.
