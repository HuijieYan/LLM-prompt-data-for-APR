## Analyzing the Bug

The buggy function `_recache` is failing to correctly set the `self._filled` attribute to `False`, which causes the failing test `test_marker_fillstyle`. The failing test is checking if the marker style is not filled, but due to the bug, the `_filled` attribute is being set to `True` instead of `False`.

## Error Explanation

The buggy function is missing the correct assignment for the `_fillstyle` attribute, which leads to the `_filled` attribute being set to `True` by default. This results in the failing test `test_marker_fillstyle` asserting that the marker style is not filled, causing the AssertionError.

## Bug Fix Strategy

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the `_filled` attribute is set to `False` in the `_recache` function. Update the function to correctly assign the `_fillstyle` attribute to `'none'`, which will then set `_filled` to `False`.

## Corrected Version of the Function

```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    self._fillstyle = 'none'  # Add this line to fix the bug
    self._filled = False
    self._marker_function()
```

By adding the line `self._fillstyle = 'none'` and setting `self._filled` to `False`, the corrected function will now pass the failing test and correctly set the attributes as expected.
