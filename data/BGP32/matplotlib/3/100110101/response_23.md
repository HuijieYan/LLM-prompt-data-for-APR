## Analysis
1. The buggy function `_recache` is supposed to reset certain attributes and call the `_marker_function`. However, the `_marker_function` is called without any check for its existence, leading to potential errors if it is not defined.
2. The failing test `test_marker_fillstyle` creates a `MarkerStyle` object with `fillstyle='none'` and expects the `is_filled()` method to return `False`.
3. The failing test fails in the assertion `assert not marker_style.is_filled()`, indicating that the `is_filled()` method returns `True` unexpectedly.
4. The bug is likely due to the `_marker_function` setting `self._filled = True`, which overrides the expected value. To fix the bug, we need to ensure that `_filled` is set based on the `fillstyle` parameter.

## Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to update the assignment of `self._filled` based on the `fillstyle` parameter. If the `fillstyle` is `'none'`, then `self._filled` should be set to `False`, indicating that the marker is not filled.

## The corrected version of the function
```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
  
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    
    # Update self._filled based on fillstyle
    if self._fillstyle == 'none':
        self._filled = False
    else:
        self._filled = True
    
    self._marker_function()
```

By adding the conditional check based on `fillstyle` within the `_recache` function, we can ensure that `self._filled` is set correctly. This fix should address the bug and make the failing test pass as expected.
