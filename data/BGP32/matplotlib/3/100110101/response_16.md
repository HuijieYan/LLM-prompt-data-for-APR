### Analysis
The `_recache` function initializes various attributes to default values and then calls the `_marker_function` method. In the failing test, an assertion error occurs when checking `not marker_style.is_filled()`. It seems that the `_filled` attribute is not being set correctly, resulting in the failing test.

### Bug
The bug lies in the `_filled` attribute not being set to the correct value. Since the fillstyle is set to `'none'`, the `_filled` attribute should also be set to `False` to indicate that the marker is not filled.

### Fix
To fix the bug, we need to update the `_recache` function to correctly set the `_filled` attribute based on the fillstyle provided.

### Corrected Version
```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    self._filled = self._fillstyle != 'none'
    self._marker_function()
``` 

By updating the `_filled` attribute to check if the fillstyle is not `'none'`, the corrected version should pass the failing test and set the correct values for the attributes.
