Based on the provided information, the bug in the `_recache` function seems to be related to the `_filled` attribute not being set correctly. The failing test `test_marker_fillstyle` is checking if the marker is not filled, but the `_filled` attribute is initialized as `True`.

To fix this issue, we need to adjust the `_filled` attribute initialization to match the `fillstyle` parameter passed to the `MarkerStyle` constructor.

Here is the corrected version of the `_recache` function:

```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    self._filled = self._fillstyle != 'none'
    self._marker_function()
```

This corrected version sets the `_filled` attribute based on the `fillstyle` parameter to ensure that it aligns with the expected behavior.

With this fix, the failing test `test_marker_fillstyle` should now pass successfully.
