### Analysis
The `_recache` function sets various attributes to default values and then calls the `_marker_function`. In the failing test, the `is_filled` method is expected to return `False`, but it is returning `True`, indicating that the `_filled` attribute is not being set correctly by the function.

### Bug
The bug lies in the assignment of the `_filled` attribute. In the `_recache` function, the `_filled` attribute is set to `True`, but it should be set to `False` according to the expected test outcome.

### Fix
To fix the bug, we need to update the assignment of the `_filled` attribute to `False` instead of `True`.

### Corrected Function
```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    self._filled = False
    self._marker_function()
``` 

By making this change, the corrected function should now correctly set the `_filled` attribute to `False` before calling the `_marker_function`, ensuring that the failing test passes as expected.
