### Analysis
The `_recache` function is meant to reset certain attributes of the MarkerStyle object before calling the `_marker_function` method. However, the bug lies in the fact that it sets `self._filled` to `True`, which contradicts the expected behavior based on the failing test.

### Bug Explanation
The failing test `test_marker_fillstyle` creates a MarkerStyle object with fillstyle set to `'none'`, indicating that the marker should not be filled. The bug in the `_recache` function sets `self._filled = True`, which means that the marker will be filled. This contradiction results in the failing test.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that `self._filled` is set to `False` when resetting the attributes in the `_recache` function.

### The corrected version of the function
```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = float('inf')  # Setting snap_threshold to infinity
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    self._filled = False  # Set filled to False
    self._marker_function()
``` 

By setting `self._filled` to `False` instead of `True`, we ensure that the markers will not be filled as expected by the failing test.
