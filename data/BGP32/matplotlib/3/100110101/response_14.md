### Analysis:
1. The `_recache` function initializes various attributes to default values and then calls the `_marker_function`, which is assumed to be a method that varies based on the marker type.
2. The failing test `test_marker_fillstyle` uses a marker style with `fillstyle='none'` and checks that the `is_filled` method returns `False`. However, the assertion fails.
3. The assertion fails because the `_filled` attribute is set to `True` by default in the `_recache` function, causing the `is_filled` method to return `True`.
4. To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the `_filled` attribute is set to `False` when the `fillstyle='none'`.

### Updated Buggy Function:
```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    self._filled = self._fillstyle != 'none'  # Update to set _filled based on _fillstyle
    self._marker_function() 
```

After making this change, the `_filled` attribute will now be set to `False` when the `fillstyle='none'`, which will make the `is_filled` method return the correct value in the failing test.
