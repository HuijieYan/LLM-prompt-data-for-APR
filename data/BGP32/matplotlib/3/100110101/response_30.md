The bug in the `_recache` function is that it is not correctly setting the `_filled` attribute based on the fillstyle provided to the `MarkerStyle` object. The function is currently setting `_filled` to `True` by default regardless of the fillstyle specified.

To fix this bug, we need to update the `_recache` function to take into account the fillstyle parameter and set the `_filled` attribute accordingly.

Here is the corrected version of the `_recache` function:

```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    self._filled = self._fillstyle != 'none'
    self._marker_function()
```

By updating the line `self._filled = self._fillstyle != 'none'`, we ensure that the `_filled` attribute is set based on the fillstyle parameter provided when creating the `MarkerStyle` object.

This correction will address the failing test case where the `_filled` attribute is incorrectly set to `True` regardless of the fillstyle specified. Now the `_recache` function will correctly set the `_filled` attribute based on the provided fillstyle, and the failing test should pass as expected.
