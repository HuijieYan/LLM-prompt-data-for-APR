Based on the provided buggy function, it seems that the `MarkerStyle` class has a method `is_filled` that is used in the failing test but not implemented in the class. This leads to the assertion error in the failing test as the method is not properly defined.

To fix this bug:
1. Implement a proper `is_filled` method in the `MarkerStyle` class that returns the opposite of the `_filled` attribute to match the assertion in the failing test.
2. Ensure that the `_filled` attribute is properly set according to the `fillstyle` parameter during initialization.

Here is the corrected version of the buggy function with the additional `is_filled` method implemented in the `MarkerStyle` class:

```python
# The corrected version of the buggy function
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    self._filled = self._fillstyle != 'none'
    self._marker_function()
    
# Add the following method to the MarkerStyle class
def is_filled(self):
    return self._filled
```

By implementing the `is_filled` method that returns the `_filled` attribute and ensuring that `_filled` is set correctly based on the `fillstyle` parameter, the corrected version should pass the failing test.
