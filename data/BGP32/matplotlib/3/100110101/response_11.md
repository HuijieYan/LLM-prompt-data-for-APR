### Analysis
The `_recache` function is missing a check for the `fillstyle` attribute, and it is not setting the `self._filled` attribute based on the `fillstyle`. This causes the `is_filled()` method to fail in the test, as it expects the `_filled` attribute to be set correctly.

### Bug Cause
The bug occurs because the `_recache` function is not setting the `self._filled` attribute based on the `fillstyle` attribute passed during the creation of the `MarkerStyle` object. This leads to the `is_filled()` method returning `True` when it should return `False` based on the `fillstyle`. The missing check for `fillstyle` causes the error in the test.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug
1. Add a check in the `_recache` function to set the `self._filled` attribute based on the `fillstyle` attribute.
2. Update the function to ensure that the `is_filled()` method returns the correct value based on the `filled` attribute.

### Corrected Version of the Function
```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return

    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    
    # Set filled attribute based on fillstyle
    if self._fillstyle == 'none':
        self._filled = False
    else:
        self._filled = True

    self._marker_function()
```

By adding the correct setting of the `self._filled` attribute based on the `fillstyle` attribute, the corrected version of the function will pass the failing test and ensure that the `is_filled()` method returns the expected value.
