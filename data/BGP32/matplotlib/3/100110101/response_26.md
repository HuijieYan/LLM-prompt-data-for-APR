## Analysis
The `_recache` function is supposed to reset certain class attributes to default values and call the `_marker_function`. However, the issue lies in the fact that it sets `self._filled` to `True` unconditionally, which contradicts the expected value in the failing test.

## Bug Cause
The failing test `test_marker_fillstyle` expects `marker_style.is_filled()` to return `False`. The `_recache` function unconditionally sets `self._filled = True`, causing the failing assertion.

## Bug Fix
To fix this bug, we need to update the `_recache` function to set `self._filled` to `False` instead of `True`.

## The corrected version of the function
```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    self._filled = False
    self._marker_function()
``` 

With this correction, the function should now work as expected and pass the failing test.
