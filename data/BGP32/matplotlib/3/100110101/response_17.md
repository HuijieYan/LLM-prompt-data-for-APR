The bug in the `_recache` function is that the `MarkerStyle` object is not being properly initialized with the `fillstyle` attribute during the `_recache` function call. This results in the `is_filled()` method returning `True` instead of `False` as expected.

To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the `fillstyle` attribute is correctly assigned when initializing the `MarkerStyle` object. We should also update the `_recache` function to take into account the `fillstyle` attribute during the object recaching process.

Here is the corrected version of the `_recache` function:

```python
# Corrected version of the buggy function
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    self._filled = False if self._fillstyle == 'none' else True
    self._marker_function()
```

With this correction, the `_recache` function will correctly set the `_filled` attribute based on the `fillstyle` attribute provided during initialization.

This fix should ensure that the failing test case `test_marker_fillstyle` passes with the `_recache` function correctly handling the `fillstyle` attribute.
