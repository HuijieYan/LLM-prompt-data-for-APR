### Analysis:
The buggy function `_recache` initializes various attributes of a marker object but fails to correctly handle the `fillstyle` attribute. This results in the failing test since the `is_filled` method relies on the `self._filled` attribute being set to `True` or `False` based on the `fillstyle`. The error message indicates that the `is_filled` method is returning `True` unexpectedly.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is caused by the `_recache` function not updating the `self._filled` attribute based on the `fillstyle` parameter provided during marker initialization. This leads to incorrect behavior when the `is_filled` method is called in the test function.

### Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to update the `_recache` function to set the `self._filled` attribute based on the `fillstyle` parameter. If the `fillstyle` is `'none'`, then `self._filled` should be set to `False`, indicating that the marker is not filled. For any other `fillstyle`, `self._filled` should be set to `True`.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    
    if self._fillstyle == 'none':
        self._filled = False
    else:
        self._filled = True
    
    self._marker_function()
``` 

By updating the `_recache` function as shown above, the `self._filled` attribute will be correctly set based on the `fillstyle` parameter. This should ensure that the failing test `test_marker_fillstyle` passes as expected.
