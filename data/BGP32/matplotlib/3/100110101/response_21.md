The buggy function `_recache` initializes the `_filled` attribute as `True` unconditionally, which contradicts the expected behavior in the failing test where `is_filled()` should return `False`. This discrepancy causes the assertion error in the failing test.

To fix the bug, the `_filled` attribute should be set based on the value of `self._fillstyle`, which is expected to be `'none'` in the failing test case.

Here is the corrected version of the `_recache` function:

```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    self._filled = self._fillstyle != 'none'
    self._marker_function()
```

With this correction, the function now sets the `_filled` attribute based on the value of `self._fillstyle` as expected in the failing test case. This change ensures that the function behaves correctly and passes the failing test.
