## Analysis
The `_recache` function sets some default values and calls a `_marker_function`. The issue seems to be that the `_marker_function` is not setting the `_filled` attribute to the correct value, causing the `is_filled` method to fail in the test case.

## Bug Explanation
The `_filled = True` line in the `_recache` function is always setting the `_filled` attribute to `True`, regardless of the actual value set by the `_marker_function`. This incorrect initialization causes the `is_filled` method to return `True` when it should actually return `False`.

## Fix Strategy
We need to ensure that the `_filled` attribute is set correctly by the `_marker_function` to match the expected value during the test execution.

## The corrected version of the buggy function
```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    self._filled = True
    self._marker_function()
    if self._filled is not None:
        self._filled = self._filled()
```
