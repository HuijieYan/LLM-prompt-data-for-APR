### Analysis:
The `_recache` function in the `markers.py` file is responsible for setting the default properties of a marker. However, in the provided buggy code, after resetting various attributes, the `_marker_function` should be called, but it is missing. This leads to the properties not being updated correctly, causing issues such as markers not appearing hollow when `fillstyle='none'` is set.

The failing test `test_marker_fillstyle()` in `test_marker.py` checks whether the marker is filled or not using the `is_filled()` method, which expects the marker attributes to be correctly updated. Since the `_marker_function` is not being called, the `is_filled()` method does not behave as expected, resulting in the failure of the test.

### Bug Cause:
The bug arises because the `_recache` function does not execute the `_marker_function` which is essential for updating marker properties. Due to this missing call, marker attributes related to fill style are not updated properly, leading to unexpected behavior.

### Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the `_recache` function calls the `_marker_function` at the end to update the marker properties correctly. This will allow the marker to behave as expected, such as appearing hollow when `fillstyle='none'` is set.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    self._filled = True
    self._marker_function()  # Add this line to update marker properties
```

After making this change, the `test_marker_fillstyle()` test should pass successfully, and the issue reported on GitHub regarding markers not appearing hollow when `fillstyle='none'` is set should be resolved.
