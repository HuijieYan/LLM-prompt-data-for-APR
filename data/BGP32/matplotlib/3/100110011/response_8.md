### Analysis:
The `_recache` function in the `markers.py` file is responsible for reinitializing marker attributes. However, the buggy function does not correctly handle the case where the `_marker_function` is not `None`. This leads to the `_marker_function()` call being made even when it should not be, resulting in unexpected behavior in marker styling.

### Identifying the Issue:
1. The `MarkerStyle` object from the test code is not correctly handling the `is_filled()` method, leading to unexpected results.
2. The `_recache` function does not consider the case when `_marker_function` is already set, leading to premature execution of the function.

### Explanation:
The test `assert not marker_style.is_filled()` fails because the custom `MarkerStyle` object is returning `True` for `is_filled()` method even when `fillstyle='none'`. This inconsistency is due to how marker attributes are being handled in the implementation.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the `_recache` function respects the existing `_marker_function`. Additionally, the `MarkerStyle` class should correctly interpret the `fillstyle` attribute to determine if the marker should be filled or not.

### Corrected Version:

```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    if self._filled:
        self._path = _empty_path
    else:
        self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt
    self._marker_function()
```

```python
class MarkerStyle:
    def __init__(self, marker=None, fillstyle=None):
        self._marker_function = None
        self._filled = True if fillstyle is not 'none' else False

    def is_filled(self):
        return self._filled

    def get_fillstyle(self):
        return 'filled' if self._filled else 'none'
```

By updating the `_recache` function to check if `_marker_function` is `None` before execution and correctly handling the filled property in the `MarkerStyle` class, we can ensure that the marker styling behaves as expected.
