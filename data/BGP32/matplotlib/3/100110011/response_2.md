### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_recache` sets various attributes to default values, but the main issue arises from the last line calling `self._marker_function()` without checking its existence.
2. The failing test `test_marker_fillstyle` tries to assert that `marker_style.is_filled()` should return `False`, but it fails due to the buggy behavior.
3. The error message highlights `assert not True` indicating that the assertion failed, leading to the conclusion that `is_filled` function is not behaving as expected.
4. To fix the bug, we need to ensure that `_marker_function` exists and is a callable function before invoking it in `_recache`.
5. A corrected version of the function is provided below.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Check if `self._marker_function` is not `None` and callable before invoking it.
2. Make sure to set the `is_filled` property based on the `fillstyle` attribute of the marker.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None or not callable(self._marker_function):
        return
    
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    
    self._marker_function()
    
    # Update the filled status based on fillstyle
    if self.get_fillstyle() == 'none':
        self._filled = False
    else:
        self._filled = True
``` 

By incorporating the above modifications into the `_recache` function, the bug causing unexpected behavior with `is_filled` should be resolved, and the failing test should pass successfully.
