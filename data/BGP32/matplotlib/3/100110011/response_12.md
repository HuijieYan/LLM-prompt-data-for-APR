### Analysis:
1. The `MarkerStyle` class from matplotlib is used to define the properties of markers in plots. The `_recache` method in the `MarkerStyle` class is responsible for reinitializing the marker properties based on the marker function.
2. The failing test `test_marker_fillstyle` is testing the `is_filled()` method of the `MarkerStyle` class after setting the fillstyle to 'none'.
3. The failing test indicates that `is_filled()` is returning `True` instead of `False`, which is incorrect.
4. The bug seems to be related to the reinitialization of marker properties in the `_recache` method, which might not properly handle the `fillstyle` parameter.
5. The GitHub issue confirms that setting `fillstyle='none'` does not result in hollow markers when using `ax.scatter()`.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is caused by the `_recache` method not correctly handling the `fillstyle` parameter when reinitializing marker properties. This leads to the `is_filled()` method incorrectly returning `True`, indicating that the marker is filled even when `fillstyle='none'`.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
1. Update the `_recache` method to correctly handle the `fillstyle` parameter and set the `filled` attribute based on the `fillstyle` value.
2. Ensure that setting `fillstyle='none'` results in hollow markers in the plot.
3. Modify the `_recache` method to reflect the correct behavior according to the desired marker style.

### Corrected Version of the `_recache` Method:
```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    
    self._filled = self.get_fillstyle() != 'none'  # Update filled attribute based on fillstyle
    self._marker_function()
```

By updating the `_recache` method to take into account the `fillstyle` parameter when determining whether the marker should be filled or hollow, the corrected version should now handle the `MarkerStyle` properties correctly, leading to the expected behavior in the failing test case and the GitHub issue.
