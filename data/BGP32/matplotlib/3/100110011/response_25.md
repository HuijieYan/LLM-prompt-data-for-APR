### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_recache` in `markers.py` is supposed to reset some attributes to certain values and then call the `_marker_function`. However, the issue lies in the fact that the `_marker_function` is being called without checking if it exists or not.
2. The failing test `test_marker_fillstyle` is checking for the `is_filled` method of `MarkerStyle` to return False, but due to the call to `_marker_function` without checking, it leads to the failure.
3. The error message indicates that the assertion `assert not True` is failing, showing that the `is_filled` method is returning True unexpectedly.
4. To fix the bug, we need to add a check if `_marker_function` exists before calling it. This will prevent any unexpected behavior in cases where `_marker_function` is not defined.
5. Additionally, the `_filled` attribute should be set based on the `fillstyle`.

### Suggestions for Fix:
1. Add a check for the existence of `_marker_function` before calling it.
2. Set the `_filled` attribute based on the `fillstyle`.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    
    # Set filled based on fillstyle
    if self.get_fillstyle() == 'none':
        self._filled = False
    else:
        self._filled = True
        
    self._marker_function()
```

By making these changes, the `_recache` function will now properly set the `_filled` attribute based on the `fillstyle`, and the failing test related to `is_filled` should pass as expected.
