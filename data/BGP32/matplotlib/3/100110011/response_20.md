### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_recache` in `markers.py` sets default values and calls a `_marker_function`, but there is no check for the existence of `_marker_function` before calling it. This leads to potential errors if `_marker_function` is not defined.
2. The failing test `test_marker_fillstyle` in `test_marker.py` uses `MarkerStyle` with `fillstyle='none'` and asserts that `is_filled()` returns `False`, which fails due to the buggy `_recache` function.
3. The failing test indicates that the `is_filled()` method returns `True` unexpectedly, leading to the assertion error. This is caused by the default value `True` set in the uninitialized `_filled` attribute in `_recache`.
4. To fix the bug, we need to ensure that `_filled` is correctly set based on the `fillstyle` parameter passed to `MarkerStyle`. Additionally, we should handle the case where `_marker_function` is not defined to prevent potential errors.
5. The fix involves updating the `_recache` function to handle `_filled` based on `fillstyle` and include a check for `_marker_function` existence before calling it.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    self._filled = self.get_fillstyle() != 'none'
    self._marker_function()
```

With this correction in place, the `is_filled()` method in `MarkerStyle` will return the expected value based on the `fillstyle` parameter passed to it, resolving the failing test and the reported issue on GitHub.
