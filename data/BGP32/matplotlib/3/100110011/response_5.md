### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_recache` in `markers.py` is used to reset marker properties.
2. The failing test `test_marker_fillstyle` in `test_marker.py` checks if the marker's fillstyle is correctly set to `'none'`.
3. The error message indicates that the `is_filled()` method is returning `True` instead of `False`.
4. The GitHub issue suggests that setting `fillstyle='none'` is not working as expected when using `ax.scatter()`.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is caused by the fact that when the `_recache` function is called, it resets the `_filled` attribute to `True`, which results in the `is_filled()` method returning `True` instead of `False`.

### Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that when `fillstyle='none'` is set for a marker, the `_filled` attribute should be set to `False`, not `True`. Additionally, we should update the marker properties to consider the fillstyle when checking if the marker is filled or not.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    self._filled = False if self.get_fillstyle() == 'none' else True
    self._marker_function()
```

By updating the `_filled` attribute based on the fillstyle before calling the `_marker_function()`, we ensure that the marker's fill status is correctly set. This corrected version should resolve the bug and allow the failing test to pass.
