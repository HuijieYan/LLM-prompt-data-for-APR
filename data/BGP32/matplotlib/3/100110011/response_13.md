### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_recache` in `markers.py` file is a method that attempts to re-cache marker properties. It sets various marker attributes to default values and then calls the `_marker_function` method.
2. The failing test `test_marker_fillstyle` in `test_marker.py` creates a `MarkerStyle` object with marker `'o'` and fillstyle `'none'`, expecting that the marker should not be filled.
3. The error message indicates that the `is_filled` method is returning `True` instead of `False`, leading to an assertion failure.
4. The GitHub issue demonstrates a user encountering a similar problem wherein setting the `fillstyle` to `'none'` does not render hollow markers as expected.

### Bug Explanation:
The bug arises from the fact that when `filled` is set to `True`, the `is_filled` method returns `True` regardless of the specified `fillstyle`. This behavior contradicts the intended functionality where setting `fillstyle='none'` should result in unfilled markers.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to revise the `_recache` method to consider the `fillstyle` parameter when determining whether the marker is filled or not. We should modify the logic in the `_recache` method to properly handle the `filled` attribute based on the `fillstyle` provided.

### Corrected Version:
```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: lib/matplotlib/markers.py

def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    
    if self.fillstyle == 'none':  # Check if fillstyle is 'none'
        self._filled = False  # Markers should not be filled
    else:
        self._filled = True
    
    self._marker_function()
```

By updating the `_recache` method to consider the `fillstyle` parameter before setting the `_filled` attribute, the corrected version ensures that setting `fillstyle='none'` will result in unfilled markers as expected. This should resolve the issue reported on GitHub and make the failing test `test_marker_fillstyle` pass successfully.
