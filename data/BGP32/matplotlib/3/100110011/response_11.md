### Analysis:
1. The `MarkerStyle` class in `markers.py` is not correctly handling the `fillstyle` parameter in the `_recache` function, which leads to markers not being displayed as hollow when `fillstyle='none'`.
2. The failing test `test_marker_fillstyle` is checking if a marker created with `fillstyle='none'` is actually considered unfilled.
3. The error message indicates that the `is_filled` method is returning `True` when it should return `False`.
4. The bug is causing the markers to be filled despite specifying `fillstyle='none'`, contrary to user expectations.
5. The bug is reported by a user on GitHub indicating the expectation for markers to be hollow, but it doesn't work as expected.

### Cause of the Bug:
The `_recache` function in `MarkerStyle` class is not correctly handling the `fillstyle` parameter. It should set the `_filled` attribute based on the `fillstyle` value, but it currently always sets `_filled` to `True`.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
1. Modify the `_recache` function to correctly set the `_filled` attribute based on the `fillstyle` parameter.
2. Update the logic in `_recache` to handle the case when `fillstyle='none'` so that the markers are displayed as hollow as expected.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    if self.get_fillstyle() == 'none':
        self._filled = False
    else:
        self._filled = True
    self._marker_function()
```

By updating the `_recache` function to correctly handle the `fillstyle` parameter and set the `_filled` attribute accordingly, the bug should be fixed, and the markers will be displayed as hollow when `fillstyle='none'` is specified.
