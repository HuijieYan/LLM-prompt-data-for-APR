### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_recache` in `lib/matplotlib/markers.py` is intended to reset marker properties.
2. The failing test `test_marker_fillstyle` in `lib/matplotlib/tests/test_marker.py` checks the `is_filled()` method of `MarkerStyle` after setting `fillstyle='none'`.
3. The error message indicates that the `is_filled()` method is returning `True` unexpectedly.
4. The GitHub issue reports a similar problem where setting `fillstyle='none'` does not make markers hollow when using `ax.scatter()`.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is caused because when setting `fillstyle='none'`, the `_recache` function in `markers.py` does not properly handle the situation to mark the marker as hollow. The function is not updating the `self._filled` attribute as expected, leading to incorrect behavior in the `MarkerStyle.is_filled()` method.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that when `fillstyle='none'` is set, the `_filled` attribute of the `MarkerStyle` class is appropriately updated in the `_recache` function. This change will reflect the desired hollow marker behavior.

### Corrected Version:
```python
# The corrected version of the buggy function
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    # Update _filled attribute based on fillstyle setting
    self._filled = self.get_fillstyle() != 'none'
    self._marker_function()
```

By updating the `_filled` attribute based on the `fillstyle` setting, the corrected `_recache` function will correctly mark the marker as filled or hollow as desired. This change should resolve the issue reported in the GitHub bug report and make the failing test pass.
