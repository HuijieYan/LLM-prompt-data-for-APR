## Analysis
Upon analyzing the provided buggy function `_recache`, the issue seems to be related to the incorrect initialization of the `MarkerStyle` object when `fillstyle='none'`. This leads to unexpected behavior in determining whether the marker is filled or not, causing the test case `test_marker_fillstyle` to fail. The error message indicates that the `is_filled` method is returning `True` when it should not.

## Error Location
The bug is likely happening in the `_recache` function where the setting of `_filled` to `True` is incorrect, causing the `MarkerStyle` object to be considered filled.

## Cause of the Bug
The bug arises from the incorrect initialization of the `_filled` attribute to `True`, regardless of the `fillstyle` setting. This inconsistency leads to the `is_filled` method incorrectly returning `True`, causing test failures and unexpected behavior when determining the filled status of the marker.

## Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the `_filled` attribute is correctly set based on the `fillstyle` parameter. When `fillstyle='none'`, the marker should be considered hollow, so `_filled` should be set to `False` in those cases.

## Corrected Version
Here is the corrected version of the `_recache` function:

```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: lib/matplotlib/markers.py

def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    
    # Correctly set the filled status based on fillstyle
    if self._fillstyle == 'none':
        self._filled = False
    else:
        self._filled = True
    
    self._marker_function()
```

By updating the `_recache` function to correctly handle the `_filled` status based on the `fillstyle` parameter, the `MarkerStyle` object will behave as expected when determining if the marker is filled or hollow. This correction should resolve the issue described in the failing test case and the reported GitHub issue.
