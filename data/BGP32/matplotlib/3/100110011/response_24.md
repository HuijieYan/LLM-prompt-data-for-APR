### Analysis:
1. The provided `_recache` function in the `markers.py` file is missing the implementation for the `is_filled` method, which is causing the test case `test_marker_fillstyle` to fail.
2. The error message indicates that the `is_filled` method is not implemented for the `MarkerStyle` object.
3. The GitHub issue also highlights a similar problem where setting `fillstyle='none'` does not hollow out the markers.
4. To fix the bug, the `is_filled` method needs to be properly implemented to handle the `filled` status of the markers.
5. We need to modify the `_recache` function to properly handle the `filled` status based on the `fillstyle`.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Update the `_recache` function to correctly handle the `fillstyle` and set the `filled` attribute accordingly.
2. Implement the `is_filled` method in the `MarkerStyle` class to return the correct filled status based on the `fillstyle` setting.

### Corrected Version:
```python
# The corrected version of the _recache function in lib/matplotlib/markers.py

def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    self._filled = self.get_fillstyle() != 'none'
    self._marker_function()
```

```python
# The corrected version of the is_filled method in lib/matplotlib/markers.py

class MarkerStyle:
    ...

    def is_filled(self):
        return self._filled
```

By implementing the above changes, the `_recache` function will correctly set the `filled` attribute based on the `fillstyle` parameter, and the `is_filled` method will return the appropriate filled status of the markers. This corrected version should resolve the issue reported on GitHub and make the failing test `test_marker_fillstyle` pass successfully.
