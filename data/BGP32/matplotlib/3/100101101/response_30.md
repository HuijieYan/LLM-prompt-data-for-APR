## Analysis
The `_recache` function in the `markers.py` file is meant to reset certain attributes of a `MarkerStyle` object before calling a marker function. However, the issue arises when the `_filled` attribute is being set to `True` unconditionally at the end of the function, regardless of the initial value of `fillstyle`.

The failing test `test_marker_fillstyle` aims to test whether the `MarkerStyle` object correctly reports that it is not filled when `fillstyle` is set to `'none'`. Since the `_filled` attribute is being set to `True` at the end of the `_recache` function, the test fails because it expects the object not to be filled.

## Bug
The bug in the `_recache` function is that it unconditionally sets the `_filled` attribute to `True` at the end of the function. This contradicts the expected behavior when `fillstyle` is `'none'`.

## Fix
To fix the bug, we need to adjust the setting of the `_filled` attribute based on the value of `fillstyle`. If `fillstyle` is `'none'`, then `_filled` should be set to `False`. Otherwise, it can remain `True`.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    if self.fillstyle == 'none':
        self._filled = False
    else:
        self._filled = True
    self._marker_function()
``` 

With this adjustment, the `_filled` attribute will be set according to the value of `fillstyle`, allowing the `MarkerStyle` object to correctly report whether it is filled or not. This fix should make the failing test `test_marker_fillstyle` pass as expected.
