## Analysis
The buggy function `_recache` is resetting several attributes to default values and then calling the `_marker_function`, which is intended to update the marker properties. However, in the failing test, it is expected to update the `_fillstyle` attribute to 'none' and set `_filled` to False. The bug lies in the fact that the `_fillstyle` attribute is not being handled in the `_recache` function.

## Bug Explanation
The `_recache` function does not handle updating the `_fillstyle` attribute based on the provided input 'none'. As a result, the `test_marker_fillstyle` test fails when checking the `_fillstyle` value. This leads to misinterpretation of the marker style, causing the test to fail.

## Fix Strategy
To fix this bug, we need to add a condition inside the `_recache` function to appropriately set the `_fillstyle` attribute to the expected value 'none'. By adding this functionality, we can ensure that the marker style properties are updated correctly.

## Corrected Version
```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    self._filled = True
    if self._fillstyle == 'none':
        self._filled = False
    self._marker_function()
``` 

By adding the condition `if self._fillstyle == 'none': self._filled = False`, we address the bug and ensure that the `_fillstyle` attribute is correctly updated to 'none', and `_filled` is set to False when applicable. This corrected version should pass the failing test.
