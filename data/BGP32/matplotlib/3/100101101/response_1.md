The bug in the `_recache` function lies in the fact that it is not setting the `self._fillstyle` attribute, which is required for determining if the marker should be filled or not. This leads to incorrect behavior in the subsequent code that checks if the marker is filled.

To fix this bug, we need to update the `_recache` function to properly set the `self._fillstyle` attribute based on the `fillstyle` argument passed to the `MarkerStyle` constructor.

Here is the corrected version of the `_recache` function:

```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    self._filled = True
    if self.fillstyle in ['full', 'left', 'right']:
        self._filled = True
    elif self.fillstyle in ['none', 'bottom', 'top']:
        self._filled = False
    self._marker_function()
```

This updated version of the function includes the necessary logic to set the `_filled` attribute based on the `fillstyle` value provided in the `MarkerStyle` constructor. Now, the function should correctly distinguish between filled and unfilled markers, allowing the failing test case to pass.
