### Analysis
The buggy function `_recache` is responsible for reinitializing certain variables. In this case, it sets `_filled` to `True` unconditionally, which contradicts the expected behavior in the failing test. The failing test expects `_fillstyle` to be set to `'none'`, and consequently, `_filled` should be `False`. This inconsistency is leading to the failing test.

### Bug Cause
The bug lies in the fact that the function unconditionally sets `_filled` to `True`, regardless of the actual fillstyle specified.

### Fix Strategy
To fix this bug, we need to update the `_filled` variable based on the fillstyle value specified in the marker style.

### Corrected Version
```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    self._filled = self._fillstyle.lower() != 'none'
    self._marker_function()
```

By updating the `_filled` variable based on the fillstyle specified, the corrected version of the function should now pass the failing test and behave as expected.
