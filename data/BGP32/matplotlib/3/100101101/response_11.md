### Analysis
The `_recache` function initializes various attributes of a marker, including `_path`, `_filled`, and `_snap_threshold`. The issue lies in the fact that the `marker_function` is called unconditionally at the end of the function, which could override certain attributes set before that call.

### Bug
The bug occurs because the `marker_function` is called regardless of whether it should or not. This can result in unexpected behavior, such as overwriting previously set attributes.

### Fix Strategy
The fix involves ensuring that the `marker_function` is only called when it is supposed to be and not unconditionally. To achieve this, we can check if `marker_function` is not `None` before calling it.

### Corrected Version
```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: lib/matplotlib/markers.py

def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is not None:
        self._path = _empty_path
        self._transform = IdentityTransform()
        self._alt_path = None
        self._alt_transform = None
        self._snap_threshold = None
        self._joinstyle = 'round'
        self._capstyle = 'butt'
        self._filled = True
        self._marker_function()
```

By modifying the `_recache` function to check if `_marker_function` is not `None` before calling it, we ensure that the function only executes when required, avoiding potential attribute overwriting issues.
