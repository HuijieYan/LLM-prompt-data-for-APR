### Analysis
The `_recache` function in the `markers.py` file initializes several attributes to default values before calling a marker function. In the provided buggy code, the function sets `_filled` to `True` unconditionally, which is causing the failing test to fail as it expects `_filled` to be `False`.

### Bug
The bug in the `_recache` function is that it unconditionally sets `_filled` to `True`, regardless of the marker function's requirements. This causes the failing test `test_marker_fillstyle` to fail because it expects `_filled` to be `False`.

### Fix
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the value of `_filled` is correctly set based on the marker function requirements. We can modify the function to set `_filled` to `False` when the fillstyle is `'none'` as expected by the failing test.

### Corrected Version
```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    
    if self._marker_function.__name__ == '_set_no_fill':
        self._filled = False
    else:
        self._filled = True
    
    self._marker_function()
```

By updating the `_filled` attribute based on the marker function requirements, we ensure that it aligns with the expectations of the failing test.
