### Analysis
The `_recache` function is resetting several attributes to their default values in the `MarkerStyle` class without considering the actual values set by the constructor. This causes the `fillstyle` attribute to be ignored and the `_filled` attribute always set to `True`. As a result, the `is_filled` method returns `True` even when the `fillstyle` is set to `'none'`.

### Bug
The bug lies in the `_recache` function's tendency to unconditionally reset attributes even if they were set during initialization. This leads to incorrect behavior where the `fillstyle` attribute is not properly set, resulting in the `is_filled` method returning incorrect values.

### Fix
To fix this bug, we need to modify the `_recache` function to only reassign attributes if they were not set during object initialization. This way, we can preserve the values set by the constructor and ensure that the `fillstyle` attribute affects the `_filled` attribute correctly.

### Corrected Version
```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: lib/matplotlib/markers.py

def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    if self._path is None:
        self._path = _empty_path
    if self._transform is None:
        self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    if self._alt_path is None:
        self._alt_path = None
    if self._alt_transform is None:
        self._alt_transform = None
    if self._snap_threshold is None:
        self._snap_threshold = None
    if self._joinstyle == 'round':
        self._joinstyle = 'round'
    if self._capstyle == 'butt':
        self._capstyle = 'butt'
    if self._filled is None:  # Preserve the attribute if it was set during initialization
        self._filled = True
    self._marker_function()
``` 

By preserving the attributes if they were set during initialization, we ensure that the `fillstyle` attribute correctly affects the `_filled` attribute, fixing the bug in the `_recache` function.
