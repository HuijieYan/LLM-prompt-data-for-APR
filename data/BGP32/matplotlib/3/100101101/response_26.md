The buggy function `_recache` is not setting the `self._filled` attribute correctly based on the input parameters. The expected behavior is for the `self._filled` attribute to be set according to whether the `fillstyle` is `'none'` or not. 

To fix this bug, we need to update the `_recache` function to check the `fillstyle` and set `self._filled` accordingly.

Here is the corrected version of the `_recache` function:

```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    self._filled = self._fillstyle != 'none'
    self._marker_function()
```

With this correction, the `_filled` attribute will be set based on the `fillstyle` parameter. This change ensures that the expected behavior matches the actual behavior, fixing the bug. The corrected version should now pass the failing test provided.
