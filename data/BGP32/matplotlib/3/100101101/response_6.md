### Analysis
The `_recache` function sets the `_filled` attribute to `True` unconditionally, which is incorrect based on the failing test `test_marker_fillstyle` where the expected `_filled` attribute value should be `False`. This discrepancy leads to the failing test.

### Solution
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the `_filled` attribute gets set based on the `fillstyle` parameter provided during the initialization of the `MarkerStyle` instance.

### Corrected Version
```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    self._filled = self._fillstyle != 'none'
    self._marker_function()
```

By updating the `_filled` assignment to depend on the `fillstyle` attribute, the corrected version should now correctly set the `_filled` attribute based on the provided `fillstyle` parameter. This change aligns with the expected behavior in the failing test case, where `_filled` should be `False` when `fillstyle` is `'none'`.
