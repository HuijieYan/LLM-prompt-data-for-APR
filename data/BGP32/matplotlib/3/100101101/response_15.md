## Bug Explanation
The bug in the `_recache` function is that it sets `self._filled` to `True` unconditionally at the end of the function. However, in the failing test case, the `fillstyle` is set to `'none'`, which indicates that the marker should not be filled (`is_filled()` should return `False`).

## Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the `self._filled` variable is set according to the `fillstyle` specified in the `MarkerStyle` constructor.

## Corrected Version of the Function
```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    self._filled = self._fillstyle != 'none'
    self._marker_function()
```

By updating the assignment of `self._filled` to be based on the `fillstyle` attribute, the corrected function should now pass the failing test case.
