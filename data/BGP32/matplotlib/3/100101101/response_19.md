### Analysis
The `_recache` function resets several internal variables of an object and then calls a marker function. The issue lies in the fact that after setting the `_filled` variable to `True`, there is no code to update it based on the `fillstyle` provided when creating the `MarkerStyle` object. This causes the `_filled` variable to remain `True` even when `fillstyle` is set to `'none'`.

### Bug Cause
The bug is due to `_filled` not being updated based on the `fillstyle` specified when creating the `MarkerStyle` object. This leads to the failing test, as the expected behavior is not met.

### Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to update the value of `_filled` based on the `fillstyle`. If the `fillstyle` is set to `'none'`, then `_filled` should be set to `False`.

### Corrected Version
```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    self._filled = self._fillstyle != 'none'
    self._marker_function()
``` 

By updating the `_filled` variable based on the `fillstyle`, the corrected function ensures that the expected behavior is met, and the failing test should now pass.
