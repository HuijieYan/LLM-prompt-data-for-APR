## Analysis
The `_recache` function is intended to reset certain attributes to default values and call a marker function, but it seems to have a bug related to the `_filled` attribute. In the failing test case, we expect `_filled` to be set to `False`, but in the current implementation, it is always being set to `True`.

## Bug Explanation
The bug in the current implementation is that the `_filled` attribute is being set to `True` unconditionally at the end of the `_recache` function. This prevents the correct value from being set based on the `fillstyle` parameter of the `MarkerStyle` class in the failing test.

## Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the `_filled` attribute is set based on the `fillstyle` parameter passed to the `MarkerStyle` constructor. This can be achieved by checking the fillstyle value and setting `_filled` accordingly.

## Corrected Version
```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    
    # Set _filled based on fillstyle
    if self._fillstyle == 'none':
        self._filled = False
    else:
        self._filled = True
    
    self._marker_function()
```

By checking the `_fillstyle` attribute and setting `_filled` accordingly, the corrected version of the `_recache` function should now pass the failing test case.
