The bug in the `_recache` function is that it does not set the `_fillstyle` attribute, which is important for determining whether the marker is filled or not. This causes the failing test `test_marker_fillstyle` to fail because the `is_filled()` method relies on the `_fillstyle` attribute.

To fix this bug, we need to correctly set the `_fillstyle` attribute based on the input value provided during the creation of the `MarkerStyle` object.

Here is the corrected version of the `_recache` function:

```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    self._filled = True
    if self._fillstyle == 'none':
        self._filled = False
    self._marker_function()
```

With this corrected version, the `_filled` attribute is set based on the provided `fillstyle` during the creation of the `MarkerStyle` object. This change ensures that the failing test `test_marker_fillstyle` will pass as expected.
