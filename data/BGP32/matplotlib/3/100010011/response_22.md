### Analysis:
The buggy function `_recache` is called when initializing a MarkerStyle object. The issue arises when setting the `fillstyle` attribute to `'none'` but the markers are still filled when using `ax.scatter()` method.

The failing test specifically checks the `is_filled()` method of the MarkerStyle object and expects it to return `False` when `fillstyle` is set to `'none'`, but it is currently returning `True`.

### Error:
The buggy function does not correctly handle the case when `fillstyle` is set to `'none'`, leading to markers being filled even when they are expected to be hollow.

### Cause of the bug:
The issue stems from the incorrect implementation of the `_recache` function, where it does not properly update the `_filled` attribute based on the `fillstyle` parameter of the MarkerStyle object.

### Strategy for fixing the bug:
In order to fix the bug, we need to modify the `_recache` function to correctly set the `_filled` attribute according to the `fillstyle` parameter. When the `fillstyle` is set to `'none'`, the markers should not be filled.

### Corrected version:
```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    # Update _filled attribute based on fillstyle
    if self.get_fillstyle() == 'none':
        self._filled = False
    else:
        self._filled = True
    self._marker_function()
```

By updating the `_recache` function to correctly handle the `_filled` attribute based on the `fillstyle` parameter, the corrected version of the function should now pass the failing test and resolve the issue reported on GitHub.
