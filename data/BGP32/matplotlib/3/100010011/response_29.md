## Analysis
The `_recache` function in the `markers.py` file is responsible for updating various attributes related to markers. The error message is indicating that the `is_filled` method is returning `True` when it should be returning `False` after setting the `fillstyle` to 'none'.

Upon inspection, the issue seems to be with the `_filled` attribute not being set correctly based on the `fillstyle` parameter.

## Bug Cause
The bug is caused by the fact that the `_filled` attribute is hardcoded to `True` in the `_recache` function, ignoring the `fillstyle` parameter.

## Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to update the `_filled` attribute based on the `fillstyle` parameter provided when creating the `MarkerStyle` object.

## Corrected Code
```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    self._filled = self._fillstyle != 'none'  # Update _filled based on fillstyle
    self._marker_function()
```

By updating the `_filled` attribute based on the `fillstyle`, the issue reported in the GitHub bug should be resolved.
