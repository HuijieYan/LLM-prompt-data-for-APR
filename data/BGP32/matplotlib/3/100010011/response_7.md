### Analysis:
- The `_recache` function sets up various attributes related to the marker style.
- The failing test is related to the `is_filled()` method returning True when the `fillstyle` is set to 'none'.
- The error message indicates that the test expected `not True`, meaning it expected the marker to not be filled but the `is_filled()` method returned True.

### Identified Issue:
- The issue lies in how the `is_filled()` method is implemented in the `MarkerStyle` class. It does not correctly handle the case when `fillstyle` is set to 'none'.

### Bug Cause:
- The bug is caused by a discrepancy between the `fillstyle` setting and the implementation of the `is_filled()` method.
- The `is_filled()` method does not properly check for the case where `fillstyle` is 'none', resulting in the incorrect behavior.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
- Update the `is_filled()` method in the `MarkerStyle` class to correctly handle the case when `fillstyle` is set to 'none'.
- The `is_filled()` method should return False when the `fillstyle` is 'none'.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    self._filled = self.get_fillstyle() != 'none'
    self._marker_function()
```

By updating the `_recache` function to correctly set the `_filled` attribute based on the `fillstyle`, the `is_filled()` method in the `MarkerStyle` class will now return the correct value. This should resolve the issue reported on GitHub and make the failing test pass.
