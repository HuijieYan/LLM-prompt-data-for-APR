### Analysis:
The buggy function `_recache()` is called in the test scenario where the `MarkerStyle` object is created with `fillstyle='none'`. The test checks if the marker is not filled, but it fails because the `is_filled()` method returns `True`. This discrepancy indicates that the `is_filled()` method is not functioning correctly.

### Potential error location:
The issue seems to arise from how the `_recache()` function initializes the `_filled` attribute of the `MarkerStyle` object.

### Cause of the bug:
The bug is caused by the incorrect initialization of the `_filled` attribute in the `_recache()` function. It is always set to `True`, even when the `fillstyle` is 'none'. This leads to the `is_filled()` method incorrectly returning `True`.

### Strategy for fixing the bug:
To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the `_filled` attribute reflects the actual fillstyle of the marker. The `_filled` attribute should be set to `False` when the `fillstyle` is 'none'.

### Corrected version of the `_recache()` function:
```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    self._filled = self.get_fillstyle() is not 'none'  # Check actual fillstyle
    self._marker_function()
```

In the corrected version, we check the actual fillstyle when setting the `_filled` attribute. If the fillstyle is not 'none', `_filled` will be set to `True` indicating that the marker should be filled. Otherwise, `_filled` will be set to `False` indicating that the marker should be hollow.

This correction should resolve the issue where markers were not hollow when `fillstyle='none'` was set.
