### Analysis:
The buggy function `_recache` is expected to reinitialize the marker attributes when called. However, in the failing test, the `is_filled()` assertion fails, suggesting that the markers are not hollow as intended.

### Potential Error:
The issue seems to be related to the `_recache` function failing to handle the case where the `fillstyle` is set to 'none' for markers.

### Cause of the Bug:
The bug is caused by the `_recache` function not properly handling the scenario where the fillstyle is set to 'none', resulting in the markers not being hollow as expected.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to check for the 'fillstyle' attribute in the `_recache` function and update the `_filled` attribute accordingly. This will ensure that when `fillstyle` is set to 'none', the markers are considered unfilled.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    self._filled = self.get_fillstyle() != 'none'  # Update filled attribute based on fillstyle
    self._marker_function()
```

By updating the `_filled` attribute based on the `fillstyle`, the corrected `_recache` function should now handle the scenario where markers are set to be hollow. This fix addresses the bug reported in the GitHub issue and should resolve the failing test as well.
