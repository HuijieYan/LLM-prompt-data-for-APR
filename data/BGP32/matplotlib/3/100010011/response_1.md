### Analysis:
The buggy function `_recache()` is causing the issue where the marker is not appearing hollow despite setting `fillstyle='none'`. The error message in the failing test indicates that the method `is_filled()` is returning `True` incorrectly, which is causing the hollow marker style to fail.

### Identified Issue:
The issue is with the `MarkerStyle` class not correctly handling the `is_filled()` method to determine whether the marker should be filled or not.

### Cause of the Bug:
The bug is caused by the incorrect logic in the `is_filled()` method within the `MarkerStyle` class. The `_recache()` function sets `_filled = True` irrespective of the fillstyle being set to 'none', leading to the incorrect return value of `is_filled()` method and the marker not appearing hollow.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
1. Update the logic in the `MarkerStyle` class to properly handle the `is_filled()` method based on the fillstyle parameter.
2. Set `_filled` based on the fillstyle provided to correctly determine if the marker should be filled or not.

### Corrected Version:

```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    
    # Update _filled based on fillstyle to determine if marker should be filled
    self._filled = self.get_fillstyle() != 'none'
    
    self._marker_function()
``` 

By updating the `_recache()` function to correctly set the `_filled` attribute based on the provided fillstyle, the MarkerStyle class should now properly handle whether the marker should appear filled or hollow. This fix should resolve the issue raised in the GitHub report.
