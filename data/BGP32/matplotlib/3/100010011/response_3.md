## Analysis
The buggy function `_recache` is called when initializing a `MarkerStyle` object. In the failing test, the `is_filled()` method is used to check if the marker is filled or not, but it returns `True` unexpectedly. This means that the `is_filled()` method is not functioning correctly, leading to incorrect behavior when setting the `fillstyle` to 'none'.

## Error Location
The issue seems to be related to the implementation of the `is_filled()` method in the `MarkerStyle` class. It is likely not properly checking the `fillstyle` attribute to determine if the marker should be filled or not.

## Bug Cause
The bug is caused by the incorrect implementation of the `is_filled()` method in the `MarkerStyle` class. When `MarkerStyle` objects are initialized with `fillstyle='none'`, the `is_filled()` method should return `False`, indicating that the marker should be hollow. However, the current implementation does not correctly handle this scenario, leading to the test failure and unexpected behavior.

## Strategy for Fixing the Bug
To fix the bug, we need to update the `is_filled()` method in the `MarkerStyle` class to properly handle the `fillstyle='none'` case. By checking the `fillstyle` attribute and returning the correct value based on that, we can ensure that the method behaves as expected.

## Corrected Version
```python
# The corrected version of the buggy function

def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    self._filled = self.get_fillstyle() != 'none'  # Update filled status based on fillstyle
    self._marker_function()
```

In the corrected version, the `_filled` attribute is updated based on the `fillstyle` of the `MarkerStyle` object. This change ensures that when `fillstyle='none'`, the marker is considered hollow (`_filled = False`), resolving the issue reported in the failing test and the GitHub issue.
