### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_recache` is responsible for resetting the marker attributes to their default values.
2. The failing test is checking if a marker style is filled or not after setting the fillstyle to 'none'.
3. The error message indicates that the method `is_filled()` is returning `True` when it should return `False`.
4. The bug is likely caused by not updating the `_filled` attribute of the marker style based on the fillstyle parameter.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is caused by not updating the `_filled` attribute of the marker style based on the fillstyle parameter. When the fillstyle is set to 'none', the `_filled` attribute should be `False`, but the `_filled` attribute is not being properly updated in the `_recache` method.

### Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, the `_filled` attribute needs to be updated based on the fillstyle parameter when the marker style is created or updated. The `_recache` method should correctly set the `_filled` attribute accordingly.

### Corrected Version:
```python
# Add necessary imports if needed

# The corrected version of the buggy function
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    if self._fillstyle == 'none':
        self._filled = False
    else:
        self._filled = True
    self._marker_function()
```

In the corrected version:
- Added a check in the `_recache` method to update the `_filled` attribute based on the `fillstyle` parameter.
- If the `fillstyle` is set to 'none', the `_filled` attribute is set to `False`.
- Otherwise, the `_filled` attribute is set to `True`.

By making this change, the marker style will correctly reflect whether it should be filled or not based on the `fillstyle` parameter provided during its creation.
