### Analysis:
The buggy function `_recache` in `lib/matplotlib/markers.py` is intended to update the marker properties. The error message from the failing test indicates that the `is_filled()` method is returning `True` even when the fillstyle is set to 'none'.

The GitHub issue describes a similar problem where setting `fillstyle='none'` does not result in hollow markers as expected when using `ax.scatter()`.

### Bug Location:
The bug likely lies in how the `_filled` attribute is being set in the `_recache` function. The `is_filled()` method probably checks this attribute to determine if the marker is filled or not.

### Cause of the Bug:
In the `_recache` function, the `_filled` attribute is always set to `True`, which causes the `is_filled()` method to return `True` regardless of the fillstyle specified in the `MarkerStyle`. This leads to the markers not appearing hollow even when `fillstyle='none'` is used.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to update the `_filled` attribute based on the `fillstyle` provided in the `MarkerStyle`. If the `fillstyle` is 'full' or 'left', the marker should be filled (`_filled=True`). If the `fillstyle` is 'none', the marker should not be filled (`_filled=False`).

### Corrected Version:
Here is the corrected version of the `_recache` function:

```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    self._filled = self._fillstyle not in ['none']
    self._marker_function()
```

In this corrected version, the `_filled` attribute is set based on whether the `fillstyle` is 'none' or not.

After applying this fix, the marker should appear hollow when `fillstyle='none'` is used, resolving the issue reported on GitHub.
