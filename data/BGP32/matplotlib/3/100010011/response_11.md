### Analysis:
1. The `_recache` function initializes various attributes related to the marker, then calls the `_marker_function()`. In this case, the `MarkerStyle` object's `is_filled()` method is being called erroneously.
2. The failing test is checking if `marker_style.is_filled()` returns `False`, but the method is not implemented correctly, leading to the assertion error.
3. The bug arises because the `MarkerStyle` class does not have a correct implementation of the `is_filled()` method, causing the assertion error when the test is run.
4. To fix the bug, we need to implement the `is_filled()` method in the `MarkerStyle` class to properly handle the case where `fillstyle='none'`.
5. We need to ensure that when the `fillstyle` is set to `'none'`, the marker is considered hollow and the `is_filled()` method returns `False` accordingly.

### Bug Fix:
```python
# Add the is_filled method implementation in the MarkerStyle class
def _is_filled(self):
    return self.get_fillstyle() != 'none'

# Corrected version of the _recache function
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    self._filled = True
    if self.get_fillstyle() == 'none':
        self._filled = False
    self._marker_function()
```

By adding the `is_filled` method to the `MarkerStyle` class and updating the `_recache` method to correctly handle the `fillstyle='none'` scenario, we ensure that the correct behavior is maintained. This will fix the bug and the related failing test, resolving the issue reported on GitHub.
