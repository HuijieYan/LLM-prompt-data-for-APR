## Analysis
The buggy function `_recache` in the `markers.py` file is responsible for recaching marker properties. The issue reported on GitHub indicates that when using `ax.scatter()` with a custom `MarkerStyle` where `fillstyle='none'`, the markers are not hollow as expected.

## Bug Cause
The bug is caused by the `MarkerStyle` class not correctly handling the `is_filled()` method. In the buggy function `_recache`, the `_filled` attribute is always set to `True`, causing the `is_filled()` method to erroneously return `True`.

## Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to make sure that the `is_filled()` method returns the correct value based on the `fillstyle` attribute of the `MarkerStyle` class. We should update the `_recache` function to properly handle the `filled` attribute based on the `fillstyle` parameter.

## Updated Function
Here is the corrected version of the `_recache` function:

```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    
    # Check if fillstyle is set to 'none'
    self._filled = self.get_fillstyle() != 'none'
    
    self._marker_function()
```

With this fix, the `_filled` attribute now properly reflects the `fillstyle` set in the `MarkerStyle` class. This should resolve the issue reported on GitHub where markers were not displaying as hollow when `fillstyle='none'` was used.
