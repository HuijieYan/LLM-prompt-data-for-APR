## Analysis:
The error message from the failing test indicates that the `MarkerStyle` object is not correctly identifying whether it is filled or not. This is related to the `_recache` function in the `markers.py` file where the `_filled` attribute is being set to `True` unconditionally.

## Identified potential error location:
The issue seems to be related to the `_filled` attribute being set to `True` regardless of the `fillstyle` parameter provided during the `MarkerStyle` object initialization.

## Cause of the bug:
The bug is caused because the `_filled` attribute is always set to `True` in the `_recache` function, ignoring the `fillstyle` parameter set during `MarkerStyle` object creation. As a result, the `is_filled()` method returns `True` even if the `fillstyle` is specified as `'none'`.

## Strategy for fixing the bug:
To fix the bug, the `_filled` attribute should be assigned based on the value of the `fillstyle` parameter provided during the `MarkerStyle` object initialization. If the `fillstyle` is `'none'`, then `_filled` should be set to `False`.

## Corrected version of the function:
```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    self._filled = self._fillstyle != 'none'  # Update _filled based on fillstyle
    self._marker_function()
```

In this corrected version, the `_filled` attribute is set based on the value of the `_fillstyle` attribute (assuming it is present in the `MarkerStyle` class) rather than unconditionally setting it to `True`. This change will allow the `is_filled()` method to correctly identify whether the marker should be filled or not based on the `fillstyle` parameter.
