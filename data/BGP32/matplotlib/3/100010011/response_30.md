### Analysis
The error message indicates that the `is_filled` method is returning `True` instead of `False` when it should return `False` since the fillstyle is set to 'none'. This behavior is inconsistent with the user's expectation of having hollow markers when setting fillstyle to 'none'.

### Bug Location
The bug is located in the `_recache` method of the `MarkerStyle` class. The `_filled` attribute is set to `True` by default, which causes the `is_filled` method to return `True` even when fillstyle is set to 'none'.

### Cause of the Bug
The cause of the bug is that the `_filled` attribute is not updated based on the fillstyle set by the user. The `is_filled` method directly returns the value of `_filled`, which does not reflect the actual fillstyle specified.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug
To fix the bug, we need to update the _filled attribute based on the fillstyle set by the user in the `MarkerStyle` class. If the fillstyle is 'none', then the `_filled` attribute should be set to `False`.

### Corrected Version of the Function
```python
# The corrected version of the buggy function
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    self._filled = self.get_fillstyle() != 'none'
    self._marker_function()
```

In the corrected version, the `_filled` attribute is updated based on the fillstyle specified using the `get_fillstyle` method. This ensures that the `is_filled` method correctly reflects the fillstyle set by the user.
