## Analysis
The buggy function `_recache()` in `lib/matplotlib/markers.py` is intended to reinitialize certain attributes when called. The error message mentions that the `is_filled()` method is returning `True` when it should not. This suggests that the `fillstyle` parameter is not being handled correctly.

## Bug Cause
The bug is caused by the fact that when the `fillstyle='none'` is passed to the `MarkerStyle` constructor, the `_filled` attribute is being set to `True` unconditionally in the `_recache()` function. This causes the `is_filled()` method to return `True` even though the desired behavior is for the marker to be hollow.

## Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to update the `_recache()` function to correctly handle the `fillstyle` parameter. We should set the `_filled` attribute based on the actual value of the `fillstyle`, ensuring that if `fillstyle='none'`, the marker is not filled.

## The corrected version
```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    # Update the _filled attribute based on the fillstyle value
    self._filled = self._fillstyle != 'none'
    self._marker_function()
``` 

With this correction, the `_recache()` function will correctly handle the `fillstyle='none'` case and set `_filled` to `False` accordingly. This change should resolve the issue reported on GitHub and make the `is_filled()` method return the correct value.
