### Analyzing the buggy function and the error message:

The buggy function `_recache` is called when recaching the style of a marker. The error message indicates that there is an issue with the `is_filled` method of `MarkerStyle`, which is returning `True` when it should return `False`. This suggests that the marker is always being filled regardless of the `fillstyle` parameter.

### Identifying potential error locations within the buggy function:

The issue might be related to how the `_filled` attribute is being set in the `_recache` function. Since the `_filled` attribute is being initialized to `True`, it might be causing the markers to always be filled, irrespective of the `fillstyle` parameter.

### Cause of the bug:

The bug is caused by the `_filled` attribute being set to `True` by default in the `_recache` function, which forces the marker to be filled. This behavior overrides the effect of setting `fillstyle` to `'none'`, resulting in markers always being filled.

### Suggested strategy for fixing the bug:

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the `_filled` attribute reflects the actual value of whether the marker should be filled or not based on the `fillstyle` parameter. We should update the logic of how the `_filled` attribute is set in the `_recache` function to respect the specified `fillstyle`.

### Corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    self._filled = self._fillstyle != 'none'  # Update _filled based on fillstyle
    self._marker_function()
```

In the corrected version, the `_filled` attribute is set based on the `fillstyle` parameter to correctly determine whether the marker should be filled or not.

By making this adjustment, the markers will behave as expected when the `fillstyle` is set to `'none'`, resolving the issue reported on GitHub.
