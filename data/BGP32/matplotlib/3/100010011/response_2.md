### Analysis:
The buggy function `_recache` is failing to correctly handle setting the `fillstyle` to `'none'`. This is causing the `is_filled()` method to return `True` when it should return `False`. The error message indicates that the `is_filled()` method is not behaving as expected.

### Error Location:
The bug seems to be related to how the `marker_function()` is handling the `fillstyle` parameter. The issue arises when setting `fillstyle='none'` and trying to check if the marker is filled or not.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is caused by the fact that when `fillstyle='none'`, the `_filled` attribute is still set to `True` in the `_recache` function. This leads to the `is_filled()` method incorrectly returning `True` when it should return `False`.

### Fix Strategy:
To fix this bug, we need to update the `_filled` attribute based on the `fillstyle` provided. When `fillstyle` is set to `'none'`, `_filled` should be set to `False`. This will ensure that the `is_filled()` method behaves as expected.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    self._filled = self.get_fillstyle() != 'none'
    self._marker_function()
```

By updating the `_filled` attribute based on the provided `fillstyle`, the corrected version of the `_recache` function will ensure that the `is_filled()` method behaves correctly even when `fillstyle='none'`. This fix should resolve the issue reported on GitHub and pass the failing test related to the `is_filled()` method.
