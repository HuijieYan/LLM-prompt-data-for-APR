### Analysis:
The buggy function `_recache` is supposed to reset various attributes of a MarkerStyle object, including the filled status of the marker. However, the bug occurs when the `_marker_function` is called, which seems to be incorrectly implemented.

### Identified Error Locations:
1. The `_marker_function` is being called without any checks or conditions, leading to undesired behavior.
2. The `_filled` attribute is set to `True` unconditionally, which contradicts the intention to make the marker hollow when `fillstyle='none'`.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is caused by the `_filled` attribute being set to `True` unconditionally in the `_recache` function. When attempting to create a hollow marker by setting `fillstyle='none'`, the `_filled` attribute is not being updated accordingly, resulting in a filled marker appearance.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
1. Update the `_filled` attribute based on the value of `fillstyle` to correctly reflect whether the marker should be filled or hollow.
2. Modify the `_recache` function to set the `_filled` attribute based on the `fillstyle` parameter.
3. Ensure that the `_marker_function` is only called when necessary to avoid unexpected side effects.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    
    if self.get_fillstyle() == 'none':
        self._filled = False
    else:
        self._filled = True

    self._marker_function()
```

By updating the `_filled` attribute based on the `fillstyle` parameter, the corrected function should now correctly handle the case where `fillstyle='none'`, making the marker hollow as intended.
