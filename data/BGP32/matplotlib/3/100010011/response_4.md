### Analysis:
The buggy function `_recache` in the `markers.py` file is responsible for setting various attributes related to markers in Matplotlib. The error message from the failing test indicates that the `is_filled` method of `MarkerStyle` is returning `True`, which is incorrect, leading to the test failure.

### Potential Error Location:
The bug might be in the `_recache` function where `self._filled` is set to `True` unconditionally. This might be causing the `is_filled` method to return `True` even when `fillstyle='none'`.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is occurring because the `_filled` attribute is always set to `True` in the `_recache` function regardless of the `fillstyle` specified. This incorrect assignment leads to the `is_filled` method incorrectly returning `True`.

### Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to update the `_recache` function to correctly set the `_filled` attribute based on the `fillstyle` specified. If the `fillstyle` is 'none', then the `_filled` attribute should be set to `False`.

### Corrected Version:
Here is the corrected version of the `_recache` function:

```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    # Set _filled based on fillstyle
    if self._fillstyle == 'none':
        self._filled = False
    else:
        self._filled = True
    self._marker_function()
```

By checking the `fillstyle` and setting `_filled` accordingly, this corrected version ensures that the `is_filled` method will return the correct value based on the `fillstyle` specified.

This fix should resolve the issue reported on GitHub and pass the failing test related to marker fillstyle.
