### Analysis:
The buggy function `_recache` in the `markers.py` file of Matplotlib is failing to correctly handle the `fillstyle` parameter when creating a custom `MarkerStyle` object. This causes the markers to not appear hollow as intended.

The error message from the failing test indicates that the `is_filled()` method of the `MarkerStyle` object is returning `True` instead of the expected `False`, which suggests that the `MarkerStyle` is incorrectly marked as filled when it should be hollow.

Based on the provided GitHub issue, the user expects to set markers as hollow by setting `fillstyle='none'` when creating a custom `MarkerStyle` object, but this is not working as intended.

### Bug Explanation:
The bug is caused by the `_recache` function not correctly handling the `fillstyle` parameter when creating a custom `MarkerStyle` object. The function sets `_filled = True` regardless of the `fillstyle` parameter specified, leading the `is_filled()` method to return `True` incorrectly.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug and ensure that markers can be set as hollow by setting `fillstyle='none'`, we need to update the `_recache` function to respect the `fillstyle` parameter when creating a custom `MarkerStyle` object. The `_filled` attribute should be set based on the `fillstyle` specified.

### Corrected Version:
```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: lib/matplotlib/markers.py

def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    self._filled = self.get_fillstyle() != 'none'
    self._marker_function()
```

By updating the `_recache` function to set `_filled` based on the `fillstyle` specified in the `MarkerStyle`, the bug should be fixed, and the markers can now appear hollow when `fillstyle='none'` is used. This correction addresses the issue reported on GitHub and ensures that the markers display as expected.
