The bug in the `_recache` function is that it is not correctly updating the `_filled` attribute based on the fillstyle set during marker creation. The function should check the fillstyle during the marker creation and update the `_filled` attribute accordingly. Currently, it always sets `_filled` to True, regardless of the fillstyle.

To fix this bug:
1. Update the `_recache` function to correctly set the `_filled` attribute based on the fillstyle provided during marker creation.

Here is the corrected version of the `_recache` function:
```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    
    if self._fillstyle == 'none':
        self._filled = False
    else:
        self._filled = True
        
    self._marker_function()
```

By updating the `_recache` function to consider the fillstyle when setting the `_filled` attribute, the corrected version should now correctly handle marker fillstyles.
