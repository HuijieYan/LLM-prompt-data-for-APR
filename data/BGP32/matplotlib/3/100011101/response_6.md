### Analysis
The buggy function `_recache` sets the `_filled` attribute to `True` unconditionally, which causes the failing test to assert `not True`, leading to failure. The test expectation is to have `_filled` set to `False`.

### Fix
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the `_filled` attribute is set based on the `fillstyle` value provided in the MarkerStyle initialization.

### Corrected Version
```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    self._filled = self.fillstyle != 'none'  # Set filled based on the fillstyle
    self._marker_function()
```

By setting the `_filled` attribute based on the `fillstyle` value provided during initialization, the corrected version ensures that the test expectations are met, and the bug is fixed.
