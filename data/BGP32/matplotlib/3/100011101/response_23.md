The bug in the `_recache` function is that it sets `self._filled` to `True` unconditionally, instead of considering the value of `fillstyle` when determining the filled status. This causes the `is_filled()` method to return `True` even when `fillstyle` is set to `'none'`.

To fix this bug, we need to update the `_recache` function so that it checks the `fillstyle` attribute and sets `self._filled` accordingly.

Here is the corrected version of the `_recache` function:
```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    self._filled = self._fillstyle != 'none'
    self._marker_function()
```

By updating the `_filled` attribute based on the value of `self._fillstyle`, the corrected function will reflect the expected behavior and pass the failing test.
