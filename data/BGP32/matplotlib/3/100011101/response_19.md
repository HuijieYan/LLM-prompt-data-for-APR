### Analysis
The buggy function `_recache` is supposed to reset certain attributes of the MarkerStyle object before calling the `_marker_function`. However, the issue seems to be with the `_filled` attribute. In the failing test, the expected value of `_filled` is `False`, but the buggy function sets it to `True` unconditionally.

### Bug Cause
The bug is causing the `_filled` attribute to be set to `True` regardless of the expected value. This leads to the failing test assertion.

### Fix Strategy
We need to ensure that the `_filled` attribute is set to `False` as expected in the failing test. This can be done by checking and updating the value of `_filled` based on certain conditions.

### The corrected version of the function
```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    self._filled = self._fillstyle != 'none'
    self._marker_function()
```

By updating the `_filled` attribute based on the `_fillstyle` value, we ensure that it reflects the expected value according to the failing test. This corrected version should pass the failing test and maintain the expected input/output values.
