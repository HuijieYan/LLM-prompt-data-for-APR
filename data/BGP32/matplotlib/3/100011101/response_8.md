## Bug Explanation
The bug in the `_recache` function is that it sets `self._filled = True` unconditionally, instead of considering the fillstyle provided during marker initialization. This leads to the `is_filled` method returning `True` even when the fillstyle is actually set to `'none'`, resulting in test failures.

## Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to update the `_recache` function to correctly set the `self._filled` attribute based on the fillstyle specified during marker initialization.

## The Corrected Version of the Function
```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'

    if self._fillstyle == 'none':
        self._filled = False
    else:
        self._filled = True

    self._marker_function()
``` 

After fixing the function with the above code, it now checks the fillstyle value before setting the `_filled` attribute, ensuring that it reflects the actual fill status specified by the marker style. This correction should address the issue mentioned in the failing tests and ensure that the function behaves as expected.
