### Analyzing the buggy function and failing test
The buggy function `_recache` is called when certain properties of a `MarkerStyle` object need to be recalculated. In this case, the failing test is checking for the `is_filled` value of a `MarkerStyle` object, which should return `False` when the `fillstyle` is set to `'none'`.

Looking at the buggy function, it seems to reset some properties of the `MarkerStyle` object and then call a `_marker_function` which might be responsible for recalculating those properties. The issue is that after resetting the properties, the `is_filled` method is returning `True` instead of the expected `False`.

### Identifying the bug
The bug is likely caused by the fact that after resetting the `_filled` property to `True`, the `_marker_function` is not correctly updating the `_filled` property based on the `fillstyle` value.

### Fixing the bug
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the `_marker_function` correctly sets the `_filled` property based on the `fillstyle` value. This can be achieved by checking the `fillstyle` value and updating the `_filled` property accordingly.

### Corrected version of the function
```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    self._filled = self._fillstyle != 'none'
    self._marker_function()
```

By updating the `_filled` property based on the `fillstyle` value, the corrected function should now correctly set the filled status of the `MarkerStyle` object, resolving the bug.
