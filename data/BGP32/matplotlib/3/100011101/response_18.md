### Analysis
The buggy function `_recache` is not correctly updating the `_filled` attribute based on the output of the `_marker_function()` call. The method `_marker_function()` should determine whether the marker is filled or not, but the `_filled` attribute is not being updated accordingly.

The failing test is checking the `is_filled()` method of `MarkerStyle` after setting `fillstyle='none'`, which should result in a not filled marker. However, the current implementation always sets `_filled=True` without considering the results of `_marker_function()`.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix this bug, we need to update the `_recache` function to correctly determine the value of `_filled` based on the results of `_marker_function()`. We should set `_filled` to `False` if the marker is not meant to be filled.

### Corrected Version

```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    self._filled = self._marker_function() is not None  # Update _filled based on _marker_function()
``` 

With this fix, the `_filled` attribute will be correctly updated based on the output of `_marker_function()`, ensuring that the marker's filling status is determined by the marker function.
