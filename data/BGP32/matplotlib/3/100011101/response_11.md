### Analysis
The error message indicates that the `is_filled()` method is returning `True` when it should return `False`. This suggests that the `_filled` attribute is not being set correctly within the `_recache()` function.

From the runtime values, we can see that `_filled` is set to `True`. However, the expected values show that it should be set to `False` in order to pass the failing test.

### Bug
The bug lies in the fact that `_filled` is always being set to `True` in the `_recache()` function, regardless of the desired `fillstyle`.

### Fix
To fix the bug, we need to set the `_filled` attribute based on the `fillstyle` provided when creating the `MarkerStyle` object. If the `fillstyle` is `'none'`, then `_filled` should be set to `False`. Otherwise, it should be set to `True`.

### Corrected Version
```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    
    if self._fillstyle == 'none':  # Check the fillstyle
        self._filled = False
    else:
        self._filled = True
        
    self._marker_function()
``` 

By incorporating the suggested fix, the corrected version ensures that `_filled` is set correctly based on the `fillstyle` provided, hence resolving the bug.
