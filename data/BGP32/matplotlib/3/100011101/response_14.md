### Explanation:
The bug in the `_recache` function is that it sets `self._filled = True` unconditionally at the end, regardless of the value of the `fillstyle`. This causes the `is_filled()` method to return `True` even when the `fillstyle` is set to `'none'`. This inconsistency leads to the failing test since it expects `is_filled()` to return `False` when `fillstyle` is `'none'`.

### Fix:
To fix the bug, we need to update the `_recache` function to set `self._filled = False` when the `fillstyle` is `'none'`. This will ensure that the `is_filled()` method returns the correct value based on the `fillstyle` setting.

### Corrected version of the `_recache` function:
```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    self._filled = self._fillstyle != 'none'
    self._marker_function()
```

By updating the `_recache` function in this way, it will correctly set the `_filled` attribute based on the `fillstyle` value, ensuring that the `is_filled()` method behaves as expected.
