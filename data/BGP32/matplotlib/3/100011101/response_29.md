### Analysis
1. The `_recache` function is called to reset marker properties, but it fails to reset the `_filled` attribute to `False`.
2. The failing test is checking if the marker style is filled or not after calling `is_filled()` method.
3. The function is failing to reset the `_filled` attribute to `False`, resulting in the `is_filled()` method returning `True`.
4. To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the `_filled` attribute is set to `False`.

### Bug Fix
```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    self._filled = False  # Set _filled attribute to False
    self._marker_function()
``` 

By setting the `_filled` attribute to `False`, the corrected function ensures that the marker style is not considered as filled, passing the failing test.
