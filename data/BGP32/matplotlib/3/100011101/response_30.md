### Analysis
The buggy function `_recache` is setting `self._filled` to `True` unconditionally, which is causing the failing test where `is_filled()` is expected to return `False`.

### Bug Cause
The bug is caused by always setting `self._filled = True` in the `_recache` function. This contradicts the expected behavior where `is_filled()` should return `False` in some cases.

### Fix
To fix this bug, we need to set `self._filled` to `False` when the `fillstyle` is `'none'` in the `MarkerStyle` constructor.

### Corrected Version
```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    self._filled = not self._fillstyle == 'none'  # update filled based on fillstyle
    self._marker_function()
``` 

By updating the `_filled` property based on the `fillstyle`, we ensure that the behavior aligns with the expected values and the failing test will pass.
