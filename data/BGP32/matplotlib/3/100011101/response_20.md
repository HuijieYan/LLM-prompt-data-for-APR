The bug in the `_recache` function is that it sets `_filled` to `True` unconditionally, which contradicts the expected behavior in the failing test where the `is_filled` method is expected to return `False`.

### Bug Explanation:
- In the failing test, the `MarkerStyle` object is created with `fillstyle='none'`, which expects the marker to be not filled.
- However, in the `_recache` function, `_filled` is set to `True` unconditionally, causing the `is_filled` method to return `True` instead of `False`.

### Fix Strategy:
- Modify the `_recache` function to set `_filled` based on the `fillstyle` parameter. If `fillstyle` is `'none'`, then `_filled` should be set to `False`.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    self._filled = self._fillstyle != 'none'  # Set _filled based on fillstyle
    self._marker_function()
```

By modifying the `_recache` function as shown above, the function will correctly set `_filled` based on the `fillstyle` parameter, ensuring that the failing test will pass.
