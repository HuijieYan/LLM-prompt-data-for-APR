### Analysis
The buggy function `_recache` seems to be resetting several attributes to default values and then calling a `_marker_function` which might be responsible for setting the `fillstyle`. This function does not handle the case when `fillstyle` is set to `'none'` correctly and ends up setting `_filled` to `True` unconditionally, leading to the failing test.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that `_filled` is set based on the value of `fillstyle`. If `fillstyle` is `'none'`, then `_filled` should be set to `False`. We also need to ensure that other attributes are handled properly to maintain the expected behavior.

### The corrected version of the buggy function
```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    
    if self._fillstyle == 'none':
        self._filled = False
    else:
        self._filled = True
        
    self._marker_function()
``` 

With this correction, the `_recache` function will properly handle the `fillstyle` attribute and set `_filled` accordingly, fixing the failing test case.
