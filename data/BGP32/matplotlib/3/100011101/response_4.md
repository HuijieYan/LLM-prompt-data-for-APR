### Bug Analysis:
The bug in the `_recache` function is that after setting the initial state for several variables, it calls `_marker_function` without setting the `fillstyle` attribute, which leads to the function not properly updating the `filled` variable. This causes the failing test `test_marker_fillstyle` to fail because it expects the marker to not be filled, but instead, it is filled due to `filled` being set to `True`.

### Bug Fix:
To fix this bug, we need to set the `fillstyle` attribute before calling `_marker_function` in the `_recache` function.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    self._filled = True
    self._fillstyle = 'full'  # set the fillstyle attribute
    self._marker_function()
``` 

By adding `self._fillstyle = 'full'` before calling `_marker_function()`, we ensure that the `filled` attribute gets updated correctly based on the fill style specified.
