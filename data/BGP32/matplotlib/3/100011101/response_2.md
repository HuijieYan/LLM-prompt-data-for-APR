### Analysis
The buggy function `_recache` is not correctly setting the `_filled` attribute based on the `fillstyle`. This causes the `is_filled()` method to return `True` when it should return `False`. This discrepancy leads to the failing test.

The `_filled` attribute is being set to `True` unconditionally, ignoring the `fillstyle`. To fix this bug, we need to update how the `_filled` attribute is assigned based on the `fillstyle` provided in the `MarkerStyle` object.

### Fix
```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    
    if self._fillstyle == 'none':
        self._filled = False
    else:
        self._filled = True
    
    self._marker_function()
```

By including a conditional check based on the `fillstyle`, we ensure that the `_filled` attribute is set correctly according to the `fillstyle` specified. This fix should address the failing test case.
