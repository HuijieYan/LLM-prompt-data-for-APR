### Analysis
The error message indicates that the `is_filled` method is returning `True`, while it should return `False` according to the failing test. This suggests that the `_filled` attribute is not being set correctly in the `_recache` function.

### Bug Explanation
The `_filled` attribute is being set to `True` unconditionally at the end of the `_recache` function. This means that regardless of the fill style specified, it is always being set to `True`, leading to the `is_filled` method returning `True` incorrectly.

### Bug Fix
The bug can be fixed by setting the `_filled` attribute based on the fill style used in the marker. If the fill style is `'none'`, then `_filled` should be set to `False`.

### Corrected Code
```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    self._filled = self._fillstyle != 'none'
    self._marker_function()
``` 

By updating the `_filled` attribute based on the fill style, the corrected function should now pass the failing test and produce the expected output.
