The buggy function `_recache` is failing to update the `_filled` attribute correctly. The expected behavior is to set `_filled` to `False` in certain cases, but the function is always setting it to `True`.

To fix this bug, we need to evaluate the condition under which `_filled` should be set to `False`. Looking at the failing test case, it seems that when the fillstyle is set to `'none'`, `_filled` should be set to `False`. Therefore, we need to check the `fillstyle` attribute before determining the value of `_filled`.

Here is the corrected version of the `_recache` function:

```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    self._filled = self._fillstyle != 'none'
    self._marker_function()
```

By updating the `_filled` attribute based on the `fillstyle` value, we ensure that it reflects the correct state when the function is called. This correction should resolve the failing test and align with the expected behavior of the function.
