### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_recache(self)` within the `MarkerStyle` class is called when a new marker style is being created or updated.
2. The failing test `test_marker_fillstyle` is checking if the marker style is marked as filled or not.
3. The error message indicates that the `is_filled` method of the `MarkerStyle` class is not returning the correct value.
4. The bug is likely caused by the `is_filled` method not being implemented or returning a hardcoded value. The `is_filled` method should reflect the actual state of the `_filled` attribute of the `MarkerStyle`.
5. To fix the bug, we need to correctly implement the `is_filled` method and ensure it returns the value of the `_filled` attribute.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
1. Update the `is_filled` method to return the value of the `_filled` attribute of the `MarkerStyle` class.
2. Ensure that the initialization state (filled or not) of the `MarkerStyle` class is set properly.
3. By fixing the `is_filled` method, the failing test should pass.

### Corrected Version:
```python
# The corrected version of the buggy function
class MarkerStyle():
    def _recache(self):
        if self._marker_function is None:
            return
        self._path = _empty_path
        self._transform = IdentityTransform()
        self._alt_path = None
        self._alt_transform = None
        self._snap_threshold = None
        self._joinstyle = 'round'
        self._capstyle = 'butt'
        self._filled = True
        self._marker_function()
    
    def is_filled(self):
        return self._filled
```

By adding the `is_filled` method that returns the `_filled` attribute of the `MarkerStyle` class, the corrected version should now pass the failing test.
