### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_recache` in the `MarkerStyle` class fails to correctly set up the `_filled` attribute based on the fillstyle specified during class initialization.
2. The failing test is checking the `is_filled` method of the `MarkerStyle` object, which relies on the `_filled` attribute being properly set according to the `fillstyle`.
3. The error message indicates that the `is_filled` method is returning `True`, which is unexpected.
4. To fix the bug, we need to update the `_recache` function to actually consider the `fillstyle` passed during class initialization and set the `_filled` attribute accordingly.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
1. Update the `_recache` function to check the `fillstyle` parameter and set the `_filled` attribute based on it:
   - If `fillstyle` is 'none', set `_filled` as False.
   - For any other `fillstyle`, set `_filled` as True.
2. This modification will ensure that the `is_filled` method of the `MarkerStyle` object correctly reflects the intended behavior based on the `fillstyle`.

### Corrected Version:
```python
# The corrected version of the _recache function
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    self._filled = self._fillstyle != 'none'  # Update _filled based on fillstyle
    self._marker_function()
```

After applying the correction to the `_recache` method, the failing test should pass as expected.
