1. The buggy function `_recache()` is a method of the `MarkerStyle` class in the `lib/matplotlib/markers.py` file. It is failing a test in `lib/matplotlib/tests/test_marker.py` related to the `is_filled()` method of `MarkerStyle`.

2. The potential error location in the `_recache()` function is the line where `_marker_function()` is called. This function, when called, seems to be setting up the correct behavior for various attributes of the `MarkerStyle`, but it appears to be incomplete or missing in the given code snippet.

3. The cause of the bug is that the `is_filled()` method of `MarkerStyle` is not returning the expected value 'True' due to some missing setup in the `_recache()` method. This causes the test to fail, resulting in the AssertionError.

4. To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the `_marker_function()` correctly sets up the behavior of the `MarkerStyle` object, including the `is_filled()` method, so that the test can pass successfully.

5. Here is the corrected version of the `_recache()` method:

```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is not None:
        self._path = _empty_path
        self._transform = IdentityTransform()
        self._alt_path = None
        self._alt_transform = None
        self._snap_threshold = None
        self._joinstyle = 'round'
        self._capstyle = 'butt'
        self._filled = self.is_filled()
```

This corrected version ensures that when `_marker_function()` is called, it will properly set up the `_filled` attribute of the `MarkerStyle` object, allowing the `is_filled()` method to return the expected value.
