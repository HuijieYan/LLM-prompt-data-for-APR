### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_recache` in the `MarkerStyle` class is not correctly setting the `_filled` attribute which leads to the failing test in `test_marker_fillstyle`.
2. The error message indicates that the `is_filled` method is returning `True` when it should have returned `False`, causing the test to fail.

### Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug in the `_recache` function, we need to properly set the `_filled` attribute based on the fillstyle provided during initialization.

### Corrected Version:
```python
class MarkerStyle():
    def _recache(self):
        if self._marker_function is None:
            return
        self._path = _empty_path
        self._transform = IdentityTransform()
        self._alt_path = None
        self._alt_transform = None
        self._snap_threshold = None
        self._joinstyle = 'round'
        self._capstyle = 'butt'
        self._filled = self._fillstyle != 'none'  # Setting _filled based on fillstyle
        self._marker_function()
    
```

After making this change, the `_filled` attribute will be set based on the `fillstyle` provided during initialization, and the corrected version should pass the failing test.
