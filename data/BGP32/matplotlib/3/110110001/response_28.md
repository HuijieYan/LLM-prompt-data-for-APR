### Analysis:
- The buggy function `_recache` in the `MarkerStyle` class is not correctly handling the case where `_marker_function` is `None`.
- Based on the test, the error occurs when calling `marker_style.is_filled()`, which means that the `_filled` attribute is not correctly set during the `_recache` function.

### Bug Explanation:
1. When the `MarkerStyle` class is initialized with `fillstyle='none'`, the `_marker_function` is not set, which leads to `_marker_function` being `None`.
2. In the `_recache` function, if `_marker_function` is `None`, it should return immediately. However, the current implementation proceeds to set various attributes.
3. Since `_marked_function` is `None`, it is not invoking the necessary function to set the `_filled` attribute properly.
4. As a result, when `marker_style.is_filled()` is called, it doesn't return the expected value, causing the test to fail.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Check if `_marker_function` is `None` at the beginning of the `_recache` function and return early if it is.
2. If `_marker_function` is not `None`, proceed with setting the attributes as required, including invoking `_marker_function` to properly set the `_filled` attribute.

### Corrected Version:
```python
# The corrected _recache function in the MarkerStyle class
class MarkerStyle():
    def _recache(self):
        if self._marker_function is None:
            return
        self._path = _empty_path
        self._transform = IdentityTransform()
        self._alt_path = None
        self._alt_transform = None
        self._snap_threshold = None
        self._joinstyle = 'round'
        self._capstyle = 'butt'
        self._filled = True  # Assume _marker_function sets this attribute correctly
        self._marker_function()
``` 

By making this correction, the `_recache` function will now handle the case where `_marker_function` is `None` and avoid setting the attributes incorrectly when not needed. This should resolve the failing test.
