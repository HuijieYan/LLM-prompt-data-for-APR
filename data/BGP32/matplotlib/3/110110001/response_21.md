## Analysis:
- The buggy function `_recache` in the `MarkerStyle` class is supposed to recalculate the properties of the marker style. However, it has a bug where the `_marker_function` is called even when it is `None`, causing the failure in the test case.
- The failing test `test_marker_fillstyle` creates a `MarkerStyle` object with a marker and `fillstyle` parameters, and then checks if the `fillstyle` matches the expected value and if the marker is filled or not. The failure is due to the `is_filled` method returning `True` when it should have returned `False`.

## Error Cause:
- The bug in the `_recache` function causes the `_marker_function` to be called without checking if it is `None`, leading to improper initialization of properties in the `MarkerStyle` object.
- The failing test then expects the `is_filled` method to return `False`, but due to improper initialization, it returns `True`.

## Fix Strategy:
- To fix the bug, ensure that before calling `_marker_function`, there should be a check to see if it is not `None`. This way, the function will only be called when it is defined.
- Additionally, make sure that the `is_filled` method returns the correct value based on the initialization.

## Corrected Version:
```python
class MarkerStyle():

    def _recache(self):
        if self._marker_function is not None:  # Add a check for _marker_function
            self._path = _empty_path
            self._transform = IdentityTransform()
            self._alt_path = None
            self._alt_transform = None
            self._snap_threshold = None
            self._joinstyle = 'round'
            self._capstyle = 'butt'
            self._filled = True
            self._marker_function()
    
```

By adding the check for `_marker_function`, the corrected version of the function should now pass the failing test `test_marker_fillstyle`.
