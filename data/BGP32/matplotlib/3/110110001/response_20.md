## Analysis
The buggy function `_recache` within the `MarkerStyle` class is failing to correctly set the `_filled` attribute based on the `fillstyle` provided when creating a `MarkerStyle` object. This results in the failing test where `assert not marker_style.is_filled()` does not pass as expected.

## Bug Location
The bug is located in the `_recache` function where the `_filled` attribute is always set to `True` regardless of the `fillstyle` provided during initialization.

## Cause of the Bug
The bug is caused by not considering the `fillstyle` attribute when setting the `_filled` attribute in the `_recache` function. Since `_filled` is always initialized to `True` and never updated based on `fillstyle`, the `is_filled` method always returns `True` even if the `fillstyle` is 'none'.

## Strategy for Fixing
To fix the bug, we need to update the `_filled` attribute based on the `fillstyle` provided during object initialization in the `_recache` function. If the `fillstyle` is 'none', `_filled` should be set to `False`.

## Corrected Version
Here is the corrected version of the `_recache` function within the `MarkerStyle` class:

```python
class MarkerStyle():
    def _recache(self):
        if self._marker_function is None:
            return
        self._path = _empty_path
        self._transform = IdentityTransform()
        self._alt_path = None
        self._alt_transform = None
        self._snap_threshold = None
        self._joinstyle = 'round'
        self._capstyle = 'butt'
        self._filled = self._fillstyle.lower() != 'none'  # Update _filled based on fillstyle
        self._marker_function()
```

By updating the `_filled` attribute based on the `fillstyle`, the corrected version of `_recache` ensures that the `is_filled` method in the failing test behaves as expected, and the test will pass.
