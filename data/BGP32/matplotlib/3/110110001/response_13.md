### Analysis:
- The buggy function `_recache` is a method in the `MarkerStyle` class.
- The function sets multiple attributes to default values.
- The failing test is trying to check if the marker style is filled, and it's failing due to the incorrect implementation of `_recache`.
- The error message indicates that the failing assertion is due to an issue with the `is_filled` method.

### Bug:
The buggy function `_recache` does not properly reset the `_filled` attribute to `True`. This causes the `is_filled()` method to return `True` incorrectly, leading to the failing test.

### Fix:
To fix the bug, update the `_recache` function to set the `_filled` attribute correctly.

### Corrected Version:
```python
class MarkerStyle():
    def _recache(self):
        if self._marker_function is None:
            return
        self._path = _empty_path
        self._transform = IdentityTransform()
        self._alt_path = None
        self._alt_transform = None
        self._snap_threshold = None
        self._joinstyle = 'round'
        self._capstyle = 'butt'
        self._filled = self.get_fillstyle() != 'none'
        self._marker_function()
``` 

By setting `_filled` based on the fillstyle, we ensure that the `is_filled()` method will return the correct value, and the failing test should pass.
