1. The buggy function `_recache` in the `MarkerStyle` class is failing to set the `_filled` attribute correctly when it calls the `_marker_function`. This issue is causing the failing test `test_marker_fillstyle` to assert the incorrect result when checking `not marker_style.is_filled()`.

2. The potential error location is in the line `self._filled = True`, where `_filled` is always set to `True` without considering the actual fillstyle passed during initialization.

3. The cause of the bug is that the `_filled` attribute in the `MarkerStyle` class is hard-coded to `True` in the `_recache` function without taking into account the `fillstyle` parameter. This causes the failing test to assert incorrectly due to the expected fillstyle not matching the actual filled state.

4. To fix the bug, we need to update the `_recache` function to set the `_filled` attribute based on the fillstyle parameter passed during initialization.

5. Here is the corrected version of the `_recache` function:

```python
class MarkerStyle():

    def _recache(self):
        if self._marker_function is None:
            return
        self._path = _empty_path
        self._transform = IdentityTransform()
        self._alt_path = None
        self._alt_transform = None
        self._snap_threshold = None
        self._joinstyle = 'round'
        self._capstyle = 'butt'
        self._filled = self.get_fillstyle() != 'none'
        self._marker_function()
```

By updating the `_filled` attribute to check the fillstyle using `self.get_fillstyle() != 'none'`, the corrected function will set `_filled` according to the actual fillstyle provided during initialization. This change should resolve the bug and make the failing test pass.
