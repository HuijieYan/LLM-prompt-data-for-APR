### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_recache` in the `MarkerStyle` class is not handling the case where `_marker_function` is not None correctly. It is trying to call `_marker_function` without any checks.
2. The failing test is trying to check if a marker is filled or not after setting the fillstyle to 'none'.
3. The error message indicates that the test failed because the `is_filled` method is returning `True` when it should be returning `False`.
4. To fix the bug, we need to properly define the behavior of the `is_filled` method and set it based on the fillstyle. Also, we need to update the `_recache` method to handle cases where `_marker_function` is not None.

### Fix Strategy:
1. Update the `MarkerStyle` class to have a method `is_filled` that checks the fillstyle and returns `False` if it is 'none'.
2. Modify the `_recache` method to correctly cache the fill information based on the fillstyle.

### The corrected version of the function:
```python
# The corrected version of the buggy function
class MarkerStyle():
    
    def _recache(self):
        if self._marker_function is None:
            return
        self._path = _empty_path
        self._transform = IdentityTransform()
        self._alt_path = None
        self._alt_transform = None
        self._snap_threshold = None
        self._joinstyle = 'round'
        self._capstyle = 'butt'
        self._filled = self.get_fillstyle() != 'none'
        self._marker_function()  # Call the marker function

    def is_filled(self):
        return self._filled

    def get_fillstyle(self):
        return self._fillstyle
```

With this corrected version, the `MarkerStyle` class now includes a `is_filled` method that correctly determines if the marker is filled based on the fillstyle. The `_recache` method also updates the `_filled` attribute based on the fillstyle. The failing test should now pass with these corrections.
