### Analysis:
The buggy function `_recache` in the `MarkerStyle` class is intended to perform some initialization tasks, including setting default values for various attributes. The issue arises from the line `self._marker_function()`, which tries to call a method that is not defined within the class. This leads to an assertion error in the failing test that checks if the marker style is filled or not.

### Problem Location:
The problematic line is `self._marker_function()` which should be removed or replaced with a different method call.

### Cause of the Bug:
The bug is causing the failing test to call the `is_filled()` method on the `MarkerStyle` object, which is returning `True` due to the incorrect function call in `_recache` method. This leads to an assertion error as the expected result is `False`.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
1. Remove the erroneous function call `self._marker_function()`.
2. Ensure that necessary attribute assignments and initializations are done correctly within the `_recache` method.

### Corrected Version:
```python
class MarkerStyle():
    def _recache(self):
        self._path = _empty_path
        self._transform = IdentityTransform()
        self._alt_path = None
        self._alt_transform = None
        self._snap_threshold = None
        self._joinstyle = 'round'
        self._capstyle = 'butt'
        self._filled = True
``` 

This corrected version of the `_recache` method should resolve the issue by removing the line that causes the bug. It initializes the necessary attributes without invoking any undefined methods, ensuring that the failing test will pass.
