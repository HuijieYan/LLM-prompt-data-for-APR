### Analysis:
- The buggy function `_recache` is a method within the `MarkerStyle` class in `markers.py`.
- The test case `test_marker_fillstyle` creates an instance of `MarkerStyle` and attempts to check if the marker style is filled or not.
- The failing test indicates that the `is_filled` method is being called but is returning `True` when it should return `False`.

### Identified Issues:
1. The `_marker_function()` is called in the `_recache` method without proper implementation or checking,
2. The `is_filled` attribute is not correctly handling the filled state of the marker style.

### Bug Cause:
The `_marker_function()` is probably setting the `_filled` attribute to `True`, leading `is_filled` to return `True` always. This causes the failing assertion in the test.

### Strategy to Fix:
1. In the `_recache` method, ensure that the `_filled` attribute is handled properly based on the actual marker function that should set it.
2. Check and correct the implementation of the `is_filled` method within the `MarkerStyle` class.

### Corrected Version:
```python
# The corrected version of the buggy function
class MarkerStyle():
    def _recache(self):
        if self._marker_function is None:
            return
        self._path = _empty_path
        self._transform = IdentityTransform()
        self._alt_path = None
        self._alt_transform = None
        self._snap_threshold = None
        self._joinstyle = 'round'
        self._capstyle = 'butt'
        self._filled = False  # Initialize as False
        self._marker_function()

    # Add an implementation for the is_filled method
    def is_filled(self):
        return self._filled
```

By correcting the `_recache` method to initialize `_filled` as `False` and ensuring that it gets set correctly, the failing test should now pass. The `is_filled` method is implemented to return the `_filled` attribute value.
