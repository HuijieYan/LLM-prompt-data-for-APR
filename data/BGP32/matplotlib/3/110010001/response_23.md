1. The buggy function `_recache` is part of the `MarkerStyle` class in the `matplotlib.markers` module. The error message is from a test in the `test_marker.py` file, checking the `is_filled` method of a `MarkerStyle` object after setting the `fillstyle` attribute to 'none'.

2. In the `_recache` function, there is a call to `self._marker_function()` without any checks or setup for `_marker_function`. This could be the source of the bug.

3. The error is caused by the `_marker_function` being `None` or not properly defined, leading to an error when trying to call it. The assertion fails as a result of this unexpected behavior.

4. To fix the bug, you should check if `_marker_function` is `None` before attempting to call it in the `_recache` function. This will prevent the error and the failing test.

```python
# The corrected version of the buggy function
class MarkerStyle():
    
    def _recache(self):
        if self._marker_function is None:
            return
        
        self._path = _empty_path
        self._transform = IdentityTransform()
        self._alt_path = None
        self._alt_transform = None
        self._snap_threshold = None
        self._joinstyle = 'round'
        self._capstyle = 'butt'
        self._filled = True
        
        if self._marker_function:
            self._marker_function()
```

In the corrected version, we added a check before calling `self._marker_function()` to avoid calling it when it's `None`. This change ensures that the `_marker_function` will only be executed if it exists, preventing the error and allowing the test to pass successfully.
