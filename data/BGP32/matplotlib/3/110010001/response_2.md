1. The buggy function `_recache` is part of the `MarkerStyle` class in the `markers.py` file of the `matplotlib` library. The error message is related to the `is_filled` method in the `MarkerStyle` class.

2. The potential error location in the `_recache` function is the line where the `_marker_function()` is called because it should be assigning to an attribute instead of just calling it.

3. The bug in the current implementation is that `_marker_function()` is called without assigning its result to any attribute. This results in incorrect behavior when retrieving information about the marker's fill status.

4. To fix the bug, `_marker_function()` should return a boolean value to determine whether the marker is filled or not, and the return value should be stored in the `self._filled` attribute.

5. Below is the corrected version of the `_recache` function:

```python
class MarkerStyle:
    def _recache(self):
        if self._marker_function is None:
            return
        self._path = _empty_path
        self._transform = IdentityTransform()
        self._alt_path = None
        self._alt_transform = None
        self._snap_threshold = None
        self._joinstyle = 'round'
        self._capstyle = 'butt'
        self._filled = self._marker_function()  # Assign the return value to self._filled
```

By making this adjustment, the `_marker_function()` result will be stored in the `_filled` attribute, allowing the correct functioning of the `is_filled()` method during the test execution.
