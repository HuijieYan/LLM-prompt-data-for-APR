### Analysis:
The `MarkerStyle` class has a `_recache` method that should update some internal attributes based on the `_marker_function`. If `_marker_function` is not `None`, it should be called. However, currently, the `_marker_function` is called without checking if it exists, leading to errors when trying to access attributes that are dependent on this function.

### Identified Bug:
The bug in the `_recache` method is that it does not check if the `_marker_function` is `None` before trying to call it. This results in errors when accessing attributes or methods that depend on the `_marker_function`.

### Cause of the Bug:
The bug is caused by calling `_marker_function` without ensuring it exists. This leads to errors when trying to access `is_filled`, which depends on the correct initialization of some attributes in the `_recache` method.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to add a check to ensure `_marker_function` exists before calling it. This will prevent errors related to uninitialized attributes in the `MarkerStyle` class.

### Corrected Version:
```python
class MarkerStyle():

    def _recache(self):
        if self._marker_function is None:
            return
          
        self._path = _empty_path
        self._transform = IdentityTransform()
        self._alt_path = None
        self._alt_transform = None
        self._snap_threshold = None
        self._joinstyle = 'round'
        self._capstyle = 'butt'
        self._filled = True
      
        if self._marker_function:
            self._marker_function()
``` 

In the corrected version, we first check if `_marker_function` is not `None` before attempting to call it. This prevents errors related to uninitialized attributes in the `MarkerStyle` class and ensures that `_marker_function` is only called when it exists.
