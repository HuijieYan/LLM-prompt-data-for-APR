## Analysis
The error message is pointing to an issue in the `is_filled` method of the `MarkerStyle` class. However, the buggy function `_recache` is missing an implementation for the `_marker_function`. This missing function call is leading to the error in the test since the `_recache` function is setting `_filled = True` but without necessarily updating it based on the actual marker function.

## Bug Location
The bug is located in the `_recache` method where `_marker_function` is not explicitly defined, as mentioned above.

## Cause of the Bug
The `_marker_function` is not being explicitly defined or called in the `_recache` function. This results in the `_filled` attribute not being updated based on the actual marker function, causing the test to fail.

## Strategy to Fix the Bug
The strategy to fix the bug is to define and call the `_marker_function` within the `_recache` method, so that the attributes of the `MarkerStyle` class are properly updated according to the marker function.

## The corrected version of the function
```python
class MarkerStyle:
    
    def _recache(self):
        if self._marker_function is None:
            return
        self._path = _empty_path
        self._transform = IdentityTransform()
        self._alt_path = None
        self._alt_transform = None
        self._snap_threshold = None
        self._joinstyle = 'round'
        self._capstyle = 'butt'
        self._filled = True
        self._marker_function()
``` 

After updating the `_recache` method with the correct calling of the `_marker_function`, the issue should be resolved, and the test should pass successfully.
