1. The buggy function `_recache` is part of the `MarkerStyle` class in the `markers.py` file of the `matplotlib` library. This function is intended to reset certain attributes of the `MarkerStyle` instance to default values. However, the issue arises when trying to call the `_marker_function` attribute without checking if it is None.

2. The potential error location is in the line where `_marker_function` is being called without checking if it is None.

3. The bug is occurring because the `_marker_function` attribute is not initialized in the `MarkerStyle` class, causing an AttributeError when trying to call it when it is None.

4. To fix this bug, we should check if `_marker_function` is not None before calling it. This will prevent the AttributeError from occurring.

5. Here is the corrected version of the `_recache` function:

```python
class MarkerStyle():
    def _recache(self):
        if self._marker_function is not None:
            self._path = _empty_path
            self._transform = IdentityTransform()
            self._alt_path = None
            self._alt_transform = None
            self._snap_threshold = None
            self._joinstyle = 'round'
            self._capstyle = 'butt'
            self._filled = True
            self._marker_function()
```

With this correction, the `_marker_function` attribute will only be called if it is not None, avoiding the AttributeError and fixing the bug in the function.
