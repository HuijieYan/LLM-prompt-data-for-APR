## Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_recache` within the `MarkerStyle` class is causing the test failure. Specifically, the function improperly calls the method `_marker_function` without checking if it exists. This leads to errors as reported in the test output.
2. The bug is present in the `self._marker_function()` call where `self._marker_function` may not be initialized properly.
3. The error occurs because the `_marker_function` may not be defined or initialized, causing the assertion failure during the test run.
4. To fix the bug, we need to ensure that `_marker_function` is checked and called only if it is defined.
   
## Fix Strategy:
1. Check if `_marker_function` is not `None` before calling it within `_recache`.
2. If `_marker_function` is defined, then proceed with calling it to recache the properties.
3. Otherwise, handle the case where `_marker_function` is not initialized to avoid errors.

## The corrected version of the function:
```python
class MarkerStyle():
    
    def _recache(self):
        if self._marker_function is None:
            return
        self._path = _empty_path
        self._transform = IdentityTransform()
        self._alt_path = None
        self._alt_transform = None
        self._snap_threshold = None
        self._joinstyle = 'round'
        self._capstyle = 'butt'
        self._filled = True
        self._marker_function()
``` 

By adding the `if self._marker_function is None` check before calling `_marker_function()`, we ensure that the function is only called if it exists. This correction should prevent the error reported in the test and allow the corrected function to pass the test successfully.
