1. The buggy function `_recache` is part of the `MarkerStyle` class in the `matplotlib.markers` module. The error message from the failing test indicates that the method `is_filled` is not returning the correct value. This is likely due to the state not being properly updated in the `_recache` function.

2. Potential error location within the buggy function:
   - The issue could be with how `is_filled` method is checking the `_filled` attribute which is set in the `_recache` function.

3. Cause of the bug:
   - The `_filled` attribute is being set to `True` in the `_recache` function, but this might not be accurate considering some markers might have `fillstyle='none'`.

4. Strategy for fixing the bug:
   - Check the values of `_filled` based on the `fillstyle` parameter in the `MarkerStyle` class constructor. Update the `_filled` attribute correspondingly. 

5. Corrected version of the `_recache` function:

```python
# The corrected version of the buggy function
class MarkerStyle():
    def _recache(self):
        if self._marker_function is None:
            return
        
        self._path = _empty_path
        self._transform = IdentityTransform()
        self._alt_path = None
        self._alt_transform = None
        self._snap_threshold = None
        self._joinstyle = 'round'
        self._capstyle = 'butt'
        
        if self._fillstyle == 'full':
            self._filled = True
        else:
            self._filled = False
        
        self._marker_function()
``` 

This corrected version of the `_recache` function checks the `fillstyle` attribute when assigning the value to the `_filled` attribute, ensuring that it reflects the correct fill status of the marker. This should resolve the issue with the failing test.
