### Analysis
The `is_filled` method of the `MarkerStyle` class is being called in the test, but there seems to be an issue with the `_recache` method in the `MarkerStyle` class. The `_recache` method is supposed to set certain attributes when the `MarkerStyle` object is created. It appears that the `_marker_function` is called without checking if it is `None` or not, leading to some attributes not being set correctly.

### Potential Error Locations
The problematic area seems to be where `_marker_function` is being called without being checked, specifically in the `_recache` method.

### Cause of the Bug
The bug is caused by calling the function `_marker_function` without first checking if it is `None`. This results in certain attributes not being properly initialized, causing the failure in the test.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug
To fix the bug, we need to check if `_marker_function` is not `None` before calling it in the `_recache` method. If it is `None`, we should handle this case appropriately.

### Corrected Version

```python
class MarkerStyle():
    
    def _recache(self):
        if self._marker_function is None:
            return
        self._path = _empty_path
        self._transform = IdentityTransform()
        self._alt_path = None
        self._alt_transform = None
        self._snap_threshold = None
        self._joinstyle = 'round'
        self._capstyle = 'butt'
        self._filled = True
        
        self._marker_function() if self._marker_function else None
        
        # Add an additional check for `_filled`
        self._filled = self._filled and self._marker_function is not None
        
    # Define the is_filled method
    def is_filled(self):
        return self._filled
``` 

### Explanation
In the corrected version, I've added a check before calling `_marker_function` to ensure it is not `None`. Additionally, I've modified the `_filled` attribute to depend on whether `_marker_function` is not `None`. This should ensure that the `is_filled` method works correctly.
