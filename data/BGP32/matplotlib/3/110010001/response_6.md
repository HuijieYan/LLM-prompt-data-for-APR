1. The `MarkerStyle` class contains a buggy `_recache` method that is causing the failing test. The error message highlights the issue with the `is_filled` method not returning the expected value.

2. The potential error location in the `_recache` method is the line `self._marker_function()` where it should assign a function to `self._marker_function` instead of calling it.

3. The cause of the bug is that the `_recache` method is trying to call `self._marker_function()` directly without actually assigning a function to `self._marker_function`. This results in an error when the function is called, leading to the failure of the test.

4. To fix the bug, we need to assign a function to `self._marker_function` when the `MarkerStyle` object is created and then call it within the `_recache` method.

5. Here is the corrected version of the `_recache` method:

```python
class MarkerStyle:

    def __init__(self, marker_function=None):
        self._marker_function = marker_function

    def _recache(self):
        if self._marker_function is None:
            return
        self._path = _empty_path
        self._transform = IdentityTransform()
        self._alt_path = None
        self._alt_transform = None
        self._snap_threshold = None
        self._joinstyle = 'round'
        self._capstyle = 'butt'
        self._filled = True
        self._marker_function()
```

Using this corrected version of the `_recache` method, the test should now pass without any errors.
