1. The buggy function `_recache` is part of the `MarkerStyle` class in the `lib/matplotlib/markers.py` file.
2. The function seems to reset certain attributes of the `MarkerStyle` instance to default values when `_marker_function` is not `None`.
3. The bug is likely due to the fact that the `MarkerStyle` class doesn't have an `is_filled` method, which causes the test to fail with an `AssertionError`. The test is calling `is_filled()` on the `MarkerStyle` instance, which doesn't exist, leading to the assertion error.
4. To fix the bug, we need to add the missing `is_filled()` method to the `MarkerStyle` class.
5. Here is the corrected version of the `MarkerStyle` class with the added `is_filled` method:
```python
class MarkerStyle():
    def __init__(self, marker=None, fillstyle=None):
        self.marker = marker
        self.fillstyle = fillstyle

    def is_filled(self):
        return self._filled

    def _recache(self):
        if self._marker_function is None:
            return
        self._path = _empty_path
        self._transform = IdentityTransform()
        self._alt_path = None
        self._alt_transform = None
        self._snap_threshold = None
        self._joinstyle = 'round'
        self._capstyle = 'butt'
        self._filled = True
        self._marker_function()
```

This corrected version includes the `is_filled()` method, which returns the value of the `_filled` attribute in the `MarkerStyle` class. Now, when the test calls `is_filled()`, it should work correctly without causing an assertion error.
