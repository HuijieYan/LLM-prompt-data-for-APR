## Analysis:
The buggy function `_recache` in the `MarkerStyle` class is not assigning the result of `_marker_function` to any variable, but rather calling it directly. This leads to an issue when trying to access the `is_filled` function later in the test, as `_marker_function` doesn't seem to provide a return value. This causes the test to fail.

## Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix this bug, the `_recache` function should assign the result of `_marker_function` to a variable and then return it. This will ensure that the function call is stored in the appropriate attribute, allowing for a correct test comparison.

## The corrected version of the function:
```python
class MarkerStyle():
    def _recache(self):
        if self._marker_function is None:
            return
        self._path = _empty_path
        self._transform = IdentityTransform()
        self._alt_path = None
        self._alt_transform = None
        self._snap_threshold = None
        self._joinstyle = 'round'
        self._capstyle = 'butt'
        self._filled = True
        self._is_filled = self._marker_function()  # store the result of _marker_function
        return self._is_filled  # return the stored result
``` 

By making this change, the function now stores the result of `_marker_function` in the `_is_filled` attribute and returns that value. This will allow the test to correctly evaluate the filled status of the marker style.
