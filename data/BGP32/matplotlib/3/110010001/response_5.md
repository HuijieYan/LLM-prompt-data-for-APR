1. The buggy function `_recache` is part of the `MarkerStyle` class in `lib/matplotlib/markers.py`. This function is responsible for resetting various attributes to their default values and calling the `_marker_function` method. The failing test is trying to determine if a marker style is filled or not.

2. The potential error location is when calling `self._marker_function()` in the `_recache` function. This is where the error seems to be originating, as the test is failing to determine if the marker style is filled.

3. The cause of the bug is that the `self._marker_function()` is not defined within `_recache`, hence it results in an error when trying to call it. This leads to a situation where the correct attributes related to marker style filling are not being set properly.

4. The strategy to fix the bug is to ensure that the `self._filled` attribute is set correctly to reflect the desired fill state of the marker style. Since the `fillstyle` attribute is being passed while creating the `MarkerStyle` object, it should affect the `_filled` attribute accordingly.

5. Here is the corrected version of the `_recache` function in the `MarkerStyle` class:
```python
class MarkerStyle:
    def _recache(self):
        if self._marker_function is None:
            return
        self._path = _empty_path
        self._transform = IdentityTransform()
        self._alt_path = None
        self._alt_transform = None
        self._snap_threshold = None
        self._joinstyle = 'round'
        self._capstyle = 'butt'
        # Set the _filled attribute based on the fillstyle provided
        self._filled = self._fillstyle != 'none'
        self._marker_function()
```

By setting the `_filled` attribute based on the fillstyle provided during marker style creation, the corrected version ensures that the test for marker fill style passes successfully.
