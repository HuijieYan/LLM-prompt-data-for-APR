1. The buggy function `_recache` belongs to the `MarkerStyle` class in `lib/matplotlib/markers.py`. The error message indicates that the method `is_filled` is returning `True` when it should not, causing the test to fail.

2. The potential error location is in the `MarkerStyle` class, where the `_recache` function sets the `_filled` attribute to `True` unconditionally. This seems to be causing the `is_filled` method to always return `True`, even when the `fillstyle` is set to `'none'`.

3. The bug is due to the `_filled` attribute being set to `True` in the `_recache` function. This conflicts with the intended behavior of setting the `fillstyle` to `'none'`, indicating that the marker should not be filled. The failing test asserts that `marker_style` should not be filled, but due to the bug, it is considering the marker as filled.

4. To fix the bug, we need to update the `_recache` function to properly handle the `fillstyle` attribute and adjust the logic around the `_filled` attribute.

5. Here is the corrected version of the `_recache` function:

```python
class MarkerStyle():
    def __init__(self, marker='o', fillstyle='full'):
        self._marker_function = None
        self.fillstyle = fillstyle  # Store the fillstyle provided in the constructor
        self._recache()

    def _recache(self):
        if self._marker_function is None:
            return
        self._path = _empty_path
        self._transform = IdentityTransform()
        self._alt_path = None
        self._alt_transform = None
        self._snap_threshold = None
        self._joinstyle = 'round'
        self._capstyle = 'butt'
        self._filled = self.fillstyle != 'none'  # Update _filled based on fillstyle
        self._marker_function()
```

In this corrected version, the `_recache` function now uses the `fillstyle` attribute passed in the constructor to determine whether the marker should be filled or not. This change ensures that the `is_filled` method checks the actual fillstyle setting, fixing the bug and allowing the test to pass.
