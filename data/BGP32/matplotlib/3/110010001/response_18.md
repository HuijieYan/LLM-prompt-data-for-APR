1. The buggy function `_recache` is part of the `MarkerStyle` class in the `lib/matplotlib/markers.py` file. This function is meant to reinitialize certain attributes based on the current marker style, but it has a bug that causes the marker to always be filled regardless of the specified `fillstyle`. The error message from the failing test indicates that the `is_filled` method is returning `True` when it should actually return `False`.

2. The potential error location within the `_recache` function is in setting the `_filled` attribute to `True` unconditionally, which overrides the `fillstyle` specified while creating the `MarkerStyle` object.

3. The bug is caused by the unconditional setting of `_filled` to `True` in the `_recache` function. This causes the `is_filled` method to always return `True`, irrespective of the actual fillstyle specified during object creation. As a result, the test fails because it expects the marker to not be filled, but the buggy implementation fills the marker.

4. To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the `_filled` attribute reflects the value of the fillstyle set during the creation of the `MarkerStyle` object. This can be achieved by checking and setting the `_filled` attribute accordingly based on the `fillstyle`.

5. Here is the corrected version of the `_recache` function with the bug fixed:

```python
class MarkerStyle():
    
    def _recache(self):
        if self._marker_function is None:
            return
        self._path = _empty_path
        self._transform = IdentityTransform()
        self._alt_path = None
        self._alt_transform = None
        self._snap_threshold = None
        self._joinstyle = 'round'
        self._capstyle = 'butt'
        
        # Check and set _filled based on fillstyle
        if self._fillstyle == 'none':
            self._filled = False
        else:
            self._filled = True
        
        self._marker_function()
```

By adding the conditional check to set the `_filled` attribute based on the `fillstyle` value specified during object creation, the bug is fixed. Now, the `MarkerStyle` object's `is_filled` method should correctly reflect the fillstyle specified, and the failing test should pass.
