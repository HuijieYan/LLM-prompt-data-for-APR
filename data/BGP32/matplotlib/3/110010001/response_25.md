1. The buggy function `_recache` is a method of the `MarkerStyle` class in the `markers.py` file. The error occurs when the test calls `marker_style.is_filled()` which should return `False` for the case when `fillstyle='none'`, but it does not do that correctly.

2. The potential error location is likely in the logic of setting the `_filled` attribute correctly based on `fillstyle`.

3. The bug is caused by the fact that the `_filled` attribute is always set to `True` in the `_recache` method regardless of the `fillstyle` value, leading to incorrect behavior when `is_filled` is called.

4. To fix the bug, we need to update the `_recache` method to set the `_filled` attribute based on the `fillstyle`. If `fillstyle` is `'none'`, then `_filled` should be set to `False`.

5. Here is the corrected version of the `_recache` method:

```python
class MarkerStyle():

    def _recache(self):
        if self._marker_function is None:
            return
        self._path = _empty_path
        self._transform = IdentityTransform()
        self._alt_path = None
        self._alt_transform = None
        self._snap_threshold = None
        self._joinstyle = 'round'
        self._capstyle = 'butt'
        
        # Set _filled attribute based on fillstyle
        fill_styles_no_fill = {'none', 'left', 'right', 'bottom', 'top'}
        self._filled = self._fillstyle not in fill_styles_no_fill

        self._marker_function()
``` 

By setting the `_filled` attribute based on the `fillstyle` value, the bug causing incorrect behavior is fixed. Now, the corrected version of the function should pass the failing test for `is_filled()` method.
