1. The `MarkerStyle` class contains a method `_recache` that is intended to recache certain attributes when called. The `_recache` method checks if `_marker_function` is not None before proceeding to reset several attributes. Finally, `_marker_function` is called. The error message is related to the `is_filled()` method trying to access the `self._filled` attribute, but the `_recache` method has not been set up properly.

2. The potential error location is in the assignment of the `_filled` attribute in the `_recache` method.

3. The cause of the bug is that the `_filled` attribute is set to `True` by default in the `_recache` method, which conflicts with the testing assertion that expects the marker style to not be filled.

4. To fix the bug, we need to update the assignment of the `_filled` attribute based on the `fillstyle` parameter.

5. Here is the corrected version of the `_recache` method in the `MarkerStyle` class:

```python
class MarkerStyle():

    def _recache(self):
        if self._marker_function is None:
            return
        self._path = _empty_path
        self._transform = IdentityTransform()
        self._alt_path = None
        self._alt_transform = None
        self._snap_threshold = None
        self._joinstyle = 'round'
        self._capstyle = 'butt'

        if self.get_fillstyle() == 'none':  # Check the fillstyle and set _filled accordingly
            self._filled = False
        else:
            self._filled = True

        self._marker_function()
```

In this corrected version, we check the fillstyle using a hypothetical `get_fillstyle` method (which should be defined elsewhere in the class) and then set `_filled` based on the fillstyle. This way, the `_filled` attribute will reflect the correct state of the marker fill style.
