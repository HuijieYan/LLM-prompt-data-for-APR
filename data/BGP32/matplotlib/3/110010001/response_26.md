1. The buggy function `_recache` is a method of the `MarkerStyle` class in the `markers.py` file of the `matplotlib` module. The error is related to the `MarkerStyle` class indicating that the `is_filled` method is not working correctly.

2. The potential error location in the `_recache` function is the line where it calls `self._marker_function()`. It should call the `set_marker` method instead to properly set the marker style based on the inputs.

3. The cause of the bug is that the `_recache` function is attempting to execute a method that is not defined within the `MarkerStyle` class, resulting in an error when it is called.

4. To fix the bug, we need to replace `self._marker_function()` with a method that properly sets the marker style based on the provided attributes like 'marker' and 'fillstyle'.

5. Here is the corrected version of the `_recache` function in the `MarkerStyle` class:

```python
# The corrected version of the _recache function
class MarkerStyle():
    def _recache(self):
        if self._marker_function is None:
            return
        
        self._path = _empty_path
        self._transform = IdentityTransform()
        self._alt_path = None
        self._alt_transform = None
        self._snap_threshold = None
        self._joinstyle = 'round'
        self._capstyle = 'butt'
        
        def set_marker(marker, fillstyle):
            if fillstyle == 'none':
                self._filled = False
            else:
                self._filled = True
        
        set_marker(self._marker, self._fillstyle)
```

This corrected version should properly set the marker style based on the provided attributes and address the error reported in the failing test.
