## Analysis:
- The `MarkerStyle` class contains a method `_recache` that initializes various attributes of the class.
- The bug is likely due to the call to `self._marker_function()` without checking its existence or validity.
- The failing test is related to the `is_filled` method not behaving as expected, most likely due to the improper initialization of `_filled`.

## Bug Cause:
- The `_recache` method does not validate the `_marker_function` before calling it, which leads to the failing test related to the `is_filled` method being called indiscriminately.

## Fix Strategy:
- Before calling `_marker_function`, ensure that it is not `None` or invalid.
- Initialize `_filled` based on the provided `fillstyle` attribute in the `MarkerStyle` class.

## Corrected Version:
```python
class MarkerStyle():

    def _recache(self):
        if self._marker_function is not None:
            self._path = _empty_path
            self._transform = IdentityTransform()
            self._alt_path = None
            self._alt_transform = None
            self._snap_threshold = None
            self._joinstyle = 'round'
            self._capstyle = 'butt'
            if self._fillstyle == 'none':
                self._filled = False
            else:
                self._filled = True
            self._marker_function()
```

By adding the condition to check if `_marker_function` is not `None` and initializing `_filled` based on the provided `fillstyle`, the bug should be fixed.
