1. The buggy function `_recache` is a method of the `MarkerStyle` class in the `lib/matplotlib/markers.py` file. This function is intended to reset various attributes of the `MarkerStyle` instance, but due to a missing method call, it fails to properly reset the instance attributes.

2. The potential error location is the line `self._marker_function()`. This line attempts to call the `_marker_function` method, but this method is not defined within the `MarkerStyle` class.

3. The cause of the bug is that the `_marker_function` method is missing from the `MarkerStyle` class, but it is being called in the `_recache` method. This leads to an AttributeError when trying to call a non-existent method.

4. To fix the bug, we need to either define the `_marker_function` method within the `MarkerStyle` class or remove the call to `_marker_function`. Since the purpose of the `_marker_function` is not clear from the provided code, I'll assume it is not needed and remove the call.

5. Here is the corrected version of the `_recache` function:
```python
class MarkerStyle():
    def _recache(self):
        self._path = _empty_path
        self._transform = IdentityTransform()
        self._alt_path = None
        self._alt_transform = None
        self._snap_threshold = None
        self._joinstyle = 'round'
        self._capstyle = 'butt'
        self._filled = True
```

By removing the call to `_marker_function`, the `MarkerStyle` class will now correctly reset its attributes in the `_recache` method without triggering any AttributeErrors.
