### Analysis
The `MarkerStyle` class has a method `_recache` that is responsible for reinitializing the attributes of the class. In the provided code, it seems that the function is calling `self._marker_function()` without properly assigning a function to `_marker_function`. This leads to the error when trying to execute `marker_style.is_filled()`.

### Error Location
The function `_recache` calls `self._marker_function()` without checking if it's properly assigned.

### Cause of the Bug
The bug occurs because the `_marker_function` attribute is not correctly assigned any value or function. Therefore, calling it directly causes the error.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that `_marker_function` is properly assigned a function. If it is not assigned, we should skip calling it.

### Corrected Version
```python
class MarkerStyle():
    def _recache(self):
        if self._marker_function is None:
            return
        self._path = _empty_path
        self._transform = IdentityTransform()
        self._alt_path = None
        self._alt_transform = None
        self._snap_threshold = None
        self._joinstyle = 'round'
        self._capstyle = 'butt'
        self._filled = True
        if callable(self._marker_function):
            self._marker_function()
``` 

By checking if `self._marker_function` is callable before executing it, we ensure that the function is properly assigned. This corrected version will prevent the error encountered in the failing test case.
