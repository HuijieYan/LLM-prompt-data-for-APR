1. The buggy function `_recache` is within the `MarkerStyle` class in the `markers.py` file of the `matplotlib` library. The function is intended to reset certain attributes to their default values based on the value of `_marker_function`.

2. The potential error location is in how `_marker_function` is called to set the default values.

3. The bug is caused because the `_marker_function` is being called as a method without the proper context, resulting in unexpected behavior and failing assertions.

4. To fix the bug, we need to ensure that `_marker_function` is a method of the correct instance of `MarkerStyle` and is called with the appropriate context. We can achieve this by defining the `_marker_function` as a method within `MarkerStyle` and using `self._marker_function` to call it.

5. Below is the corrected version of the `_recache` function:

```python
class MarkerStyle():

    def _recache(self):
        if self._marker_function is None:
            return
        self._path = _empty_path
        self._transform = IdentityTransform()
        self._alt_path = None
        self._alt_transform = None
        self._snap_threshold = None
        self._joinstyle = 'round'
        self._capstyle = 'butt'
        self._filled = True
        
        # Call _marker_function with the context of the current instance
        self._marker_function()
``` 

With this fix, the `_marker_function` will be called within the context of the current `MarkerStyle` instance, resolving the bug and causing the test to pass successfully.
