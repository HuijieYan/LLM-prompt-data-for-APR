### Analysis:
The error message is indicating that the `is_filled()` method is not behaving as expected. The failing test is trying to assert `not True`, which should be False if `is_filled()` works correctly. This implies that the `is_filled()` method in the `MarkerStyle` class is returning `True` even when the fill style is set to 'none'.

### Potential Error Locations:
The issue seems to be in the `is_filled()` method inside the `MarkerStyle` class. The method might be incorrectly determining the filled status based on the fill style attribute.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is likely caused by the `is_filled()` method not properly considering the case where the fill style is set to 'none'. This causes the method to return `True` instead of `False` when the fill style should indicate that the marker is not filled.

### Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to update the `is_filled()` method in the `MarkerStyle` class to correctly handle the case where the fill style is 'none' and return `False` accordingly.

### Corrected Version:
Here's the corrected version of the `MarkerStyle` class with the adjusted `is_filled()` method:

```python
class MarkerStyle():

    def is_filled(self):
        return self._filled

    def _recache(self):
        if self._marker_function is None:
            return
        self._path = _empty_path
        self._transform = IdentityTransform()
        self._alt_path = None
        self._alt_transform = None
        self._snap_threshold = None
        self._joinstyle = 'round'
        self._capstyle = 'butt'
        self._filled = True
        self._marker_function()
``` 

This correction should ensure that the `is_filled()` method uses the `_filled` attribute directly, allowing it to correctly return `False` when the fill style is 'none', as intended.
