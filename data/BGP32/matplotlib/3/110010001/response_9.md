1. The buggy function `_recache` is a method within the `MarkerStyle` class in the `markers.py` file of the `matplotlib` library. The error message states that when attempting to test the `is_filled` method of `MarkerStyle`, it returned `True` unexpectedly.

2. The potential error locations in the `_recache` function could be related to the `_marker_function()` call and the `is_filled` method of `MarkerStyle`.

3. The bug likely stems from the fact that the `_recache` function calls `_marker_function()` without setting `_marker_function` first. This results in an error when trying to access attributes or methods related to `_marker_function`.

4. To fix the bug, we need to set `_marker_function` to a valid function that determines whether the marker should be filled or not. This function should return a boolean value indicating whether the marker should be filled or not.

5. Here is the corrected version of the `_recache` function:

```python
class MarkerStyle():

    def _recache(self):
        if self._marker_function is None:
            return
        
        # Assume `_marker_function` is a method that determines if the marker should be filled
        self._filled = self._marker_function()
        
        self._path = _empty_path
        self._transform = IdentityTransform()
        self._alt_path = None
        self._alt_transform = None
        self._snap_threshold = None
        self._joinstyle = 'round'
        self._capstyle = 'butt'
```

By setting the `_filled` attribute based on the return value of `_marker_function`, we ensure that the correct fill status of the marker is updated during the `_recache` process. This should fix the bug and allow the `is_filled` method to return the expected result during testing.
