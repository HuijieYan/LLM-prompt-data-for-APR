### Analysis:
The error message indicates that the `is_filled()` method is returning `True` when it should be returning `False`. This discrepancy is likely due to the `_filled` attribute not being correctly set to `False` in the `_recache` method of the `MarkerStyle` class.

### Error Location:
The issue lies in the `_recache` method where the `_filled` attribute is always set to `True`, regardless of the intended value specified through the constructor.

### Cause of the Bug:
The bug occurs because the `_filled` attribute is always set to `True` in the `_recache` method, overriding any value set during initialization. This leads to the incorrect behavior in the `is_filled()` method.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix this bug, we should update the `_recache` method to correctly initialize the `_filled` attribute based on the provided fillstyle. This can be done by checking the fillstyle value and setting `_filled` accordingly.

### Corrected Version:
```python
class MarkerStyle():
    def __init__(self, marker='o', fillstyle='full'):
        self._marker = marker
        self._fillstyle = fillstyle
        self._marker_function = None
        self._recache()

    def _recache(self):
        if self._marker_function is None:
            return
        self._path = _empty_path
        self._transform = IdentityTransform()
        self._alt_path = None
        self._alt_transform = None
        self._snap_threshold = None
        self._joinstyle = 'round'
        self._capstyle = 'butt'

        if self._fillstyle == 'none':
            self._filled = False
        else:
            self._filled = True

        self._marker_function()

    def is_filled(self):
        return self._filled

    def get_fillstyle(self):
        return self._fillstyle
```

In this corrected version, the `_filled` attribute is correctly initialized based on the fillstyle provided during object creation. This should ensure that the `is_filled()` method returns the correct value based on the fillstyle set for the marker.
