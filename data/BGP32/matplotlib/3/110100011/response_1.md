### Analysis:
1. **Buggy Function**: The `_recache` method of the `MarkerStyle` class is designed to reset certain attributes to default values and call a marker function if it exists.
   
2. **Relationship with Buggy Class/Test Code**: The failing test `test_marker_fillstyle` uses the `MarkerStyle` class constructor and tests the `get_fillstyle` and `is_filled` methods.

3. **Identified Error Locations**:
   - The `_recache` method sets `_filled` attribute to `True` unconditionally, even when the `fillstyle` is set to `'none'` in the test.
   
4. **Cause of the Bug**:
   - The bug causes the markers to be filled despite setting `fillstyle` to `'none'`, contradicting the user's expectation of having hollow markers.
   
5. **Strategy for Fixing the Bug**:
   - Modify the `_recache` method to check if `fillstyle` is `'none'` and update the `_filled` attribute accordingly.

### Corrected Version:
```python
class MarkerStyle():
    def _recache(self):
        if self._marker_function is None:
            return
        self._path = _empty_path
        self._transform = IdentityTransform()
        self._alt_path = None
        self._alt_transform = None
        self._snap_threshold = None
        self._joinstyle = 'round'
        self._capstyle = 'butt'
        self._filled = self.get_fillstyle() != 'none'  # Update filled based on fillstyle
        self._marker_function()
```

By updating the `_filled` attribute based on the `fillstyle`, the corrected version of the `_recache` method ensures that markers will be filled or hollow according to the user's specified `fillstyle` in the marker style. This modification resolves the issue where hollow markers were not displayed as expected when setting `fillstyle` to `'none'`.
