### 1. Analysis of the buggy function and its relationship with the test code and GitHub issue:

- The buggy function `_recache` is part of the `MarkerStyle` class in the file `markers.py` of `matplotlib`.
- The failing test `test_marker_fillstyle` creates a `MarkerStyle` object with `fillstyle='none'` and expects it to have a fill style of 'none'.
- The GitHub issue reports that setting `fillstyle='none'` does not make markers hollow when used with `ax.scatter()`.
- The `_recache` function is responsible for re-caching marker properties but it fails to handle the case where the `filled` property should be set to `False` when `fillstyle='none'` is selected.

### 2. Identified potential error location within the buggy function:
- The issue seems to be with setting the `_filled` property to `True` unconditionally, even if `fillstyle` is set to `'none'`, causing the markers to be filled.

### 3. Cause of the bug:
- The bug occurs because the `_recache` function in `MarkerStyle` class does not handle the case of `fillstyle='none'` correctly, leading to markers not being hollow as expected.

### 4. Strategy for fixing the bug:
- Update the `_recache` function in the `MarkerStyle` class to correctly set the `_filled` property based on the `fillstyle` parameter.

### 5. Corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
class MarkerStyle():

    def _recache(self):
        if self._marker_function is None:
            return
        self._path = _empty_path
        self._transform = IdentityTransform()
        self._alt_path = None
        self._alt_transform = None
        self._snap_threshold = None
        self._joinstyle = 'round'
        self._capstyle = 'butt'
        
        # Update _filled based on fillstyle
        if self._fillstyle == 'none':
            self._filled = False
        else:
            self._filled = True
        
        self._marker_function()
```

By updating the `_recache` function to set the `_filled` property correctly based on the `fillstyle`, the bug should be fixed, and the failing test should pass as expected. This correction aligns the behavior of the `MarkerStyle` class with the expectation of making markers hollow when `fillstyle='none'` is used.
