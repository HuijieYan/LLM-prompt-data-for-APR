### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_recache` in the `MarkerStyle` class does not correctly handle the condition when `_marker_function` is None.
2. The failing test `test_marker_fillstyle` checks if the `MarkerStyle` object created with `fillstyle='none'` returns the correct value and if it is filled or not.
3. The GitHub issue highlights that setting `fillstyle='none'` does not result in hollow markers as expected.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is caused because the `_recache` function does not consider the case when `_marker_function` is None, leading to unexpected behavior where the marker is not correctly set to a hollow style.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to modify the `_recache` function to handle the case when `_marker_function` is None. We should avoid calling `_marker_function()` when it is not defined.

### Corrected Version:
```python
class MarkerStyle():
    def _recache(self):
        if self._marker_function is None:
            return
        self._path = _empty_path
        self._transform = IdentityTransform()
        self._alt_path = None
        self._alt_transform = None
        self._snap_threshold = None
        self._joinstyle = 'round'
        self._capstyle = 'butt'
        self._filled = True
        if self._marker_function:
            self._marker_function()
``` 

After making this correction, the `MarkerStyle` class will behave as expected, and the supplied failing test `test_marker_fillstyle` should pass successfully.
