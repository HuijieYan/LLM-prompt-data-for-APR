### Analysis:
The buggy function `_recache` is not correctly re-initializing the `_filled` attribute based on the `fillstyle` parameter provided during the initialization of `MarkerStyle` object. This is causing the markers to always be treated as filled even when `fillstyle='none'`.

### Error Location:
The error is located in the `_recache` function where `_filled` is hard-coded to `True` without considering the `fillstyle` parameter.

### Cause of the Bug:
The bug is caused by the `_recache` function not updating the `_filled` attribute based on the `fillstyle` parameter. This causes markers to be assumed as filled by default.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Update the `_recache` function to correctly evaluate the `fillstyle` parameter and set `_filled` accordingly.
2. Use the `fillstyle` parameter to determine if the marker should be filled or hollow.
3. Update the logic to assign `True` or `False` to `_filled` based on the `fillstyle` parameter.

### Corrected Version:
```python
class MarkerStyle():
    def _recache(self):
        if self._marker_function is None:
            return
        self._path = _empty_path
        self._transform = IdentityTransform()
        self._alt_path = None
        self._alt_transform = None
        self._snap_threshold = None
        self._joinstyle = 'round'
        self._capstyle = 'butt'
        self._filled = self._fillstyle != 'none'
        self._marker_function()
```

Now, the corrected version of the `_recache` function will correctly update the `_filled` attribute based on the `fillstyle` parameter provided during the initialization of the `MarkerStyle` object.

This fix will ensure that when `fillstyle='none'`, the markers will be hollow as intended.

After implementing this correction, the failing test `test_marker_fillstyle` should pass successfully and the issue reported on GitHub regarding markers not being hollow when `fillstyle='none'` should be resolved.
