### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_recache` in the `MarkerStyle` class is supposed to handle the recaching of marker attributes.
2. The issue is related to the `fillstyle` attribute not working as expected when set to 'none'.
3. The failing test is testing the `fillstyle` attribute of the `MarkerStyle` class, which is not functioning correctly according to the GitHub issue description.
4. The bug is likely caused by the incorrect handling of the `fillstyle` attribute in the `_recache` function.
5. To fix the bug, we need to update the `_recache` function to correctly handle the `fillstyle` attribute when set to 'none'.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is caused by not handling the `fillstyle` attribute correctly in the `_recache` function. The code in the buggy function does not consider the `fillstyle` attribute, which leads to incorrect behavior when trying to set it to 'none'.

### Bug Fix:
To fix the bug, we need to update the `_recache` function to properly handle the `fillstyle` attribute based on the provided value. Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
class MarkerStyle():
    def _recache(self):
        if self._marker_function is None:
            return
        self._path = _empty_path
        self._transform = IdentityTransform()
        self._alt_path = None
        self._alt_transform = None
        self._snap_threshold = None
        self._joinstyle = 'round'
        self._capstyle = 'butt'
        self._filled = self._fillstyle != 'none'
        self._marker_function()
```

With this fix, the `filled` attribute will be correctly set based on the `fillstyle` value, ensuring that markers are displayed as expected when `fillstyle='none'`.

Now, the provided failing test should pass after applying this fix.
