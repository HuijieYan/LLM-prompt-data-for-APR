### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_recache` in the `MarkerStyle` class is responsible for setting various attributes when called.
2. The test `test_marker_fillstyle` is checking if the `fillstyle` attribute is set correctly.
3. The GitHub issue highlights the problem where setting `fillstyle='none'` does not result in hollow markers as expected.
4. The bug occurs because the `_marker_function` is called at the end of `_recache` which may override the `fillstyle` set earlier.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is caused by the `_marker_function` being called at the end of the `_recache` function. This function is responsible for setting marker attributes, but calling `_marker_function` after setting other attributes could potentially override the `fillstyle`.

### Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, the `_marker_function` should be called before setting any specific attributes to prevent it from overriding them. Additionally, there should be checks and fallbacks for cases where `_marker_function` is `None`.

### Corrected Version:
```python
# The corrected version of the buggy function
class MarkerStyle():

    def _recache(self):
        if self._marker_function is None:
            return
        
        # Call marker function first
        self._marker_function()
        
        self._path = _empty_path
        self._transform = IdentityTransform()
        self._alt_path = None
        self._alt_transform = None
        self._snap_threshold = None
        self._joinstyle = 'round'
        self._capstyle = 'butt'
        self._filled = True
```

After implementing this correction, the issue mentioned on GitHub should be resolved, and the test `test_marker_fillstyle` should pass successfully.
