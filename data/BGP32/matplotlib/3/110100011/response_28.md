### Analysis:
1. **Relationship with Buggy Class, Test Code, and GitHub Issue**:
   - The buggy function `_recache` is part of the `MarkerStyle` class in `markers.py`.
   - The failing test function `test_marker_fillstyle` is checking if the `MarkerStyle` object behaves correctly when `fillstyle` is set to `'none'`.
   - The GitHub issue mentioned that setting `fillstyle` to `'none'` doesn't render hollow markers as expected when using `ax.scatter()`.

2. **Potential Error Locations**:
   - The issue might be that the `_marker_function` is being called even when `fillstyle` is set to `'none'`, which could override the specified fill style.

3. **Cause of the Bug**:
   - In the original `_recache` function, the `_marker_function` is called without considering the `fillstyle` set to `'none'`. This could be causing the markers to not render as hollow as expected.

4. **Strategy for Fixing the Bug**:
   - Check if `_marker_function` should be called when `fillstyle` is set to `'none'`. If not, conditionally skip calling it.

### Corrected Version:
```python
class MarkerStyle():
    def _recache(self):
        if self._marker_function is None:
            return
        self._path = _empty_path
        self._transform = IdentityTransform()
        self._alt_path = None
        self._alt_transform = None
        self._snap_threshold = None
        self._joinstyle = 'round'
        self._capstyle = 'butt'
        self._filled = self.get_fillstyle() != 'none'  # Set filled based on fillstyle
        if self._filled:
            self._marker_function()
``` 

In the corrected version:
- The `_filled` attribute is set based on the `fillstyle`. If `fillstyle` is not `'none'`, the `_marker_function` will be called. Otherwise, `_marker_function` will not be called, making the markers render hollow when `fillstyle='none'`.

This fix should address the issue reported in the GitHub bug and make the failing test pass.
