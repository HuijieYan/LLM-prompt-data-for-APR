### Analysis:
- The buggy function `_recache` in the `MarkerStyle` class is meant to reinitialize certain attributes when needed.
- The failing test `test_marker_fillstyle` is checking if the `fillstyle` attribute of `MarkerStyle` is correctly set to `'none'`.
- The GitHub issue reports that setting `fillstyle='none'` does not make markers hollow as expected when using `ax.scatter()`.

### Identified Potential Issues:
1. In the `_recache` function, the line `self._marker_function()` is called without any check or initialization of the `_marker_function`. This can lead to unexpected behavior.
2. The `is_filled()` method check is missing in the `MarkerStyle` class, which might affect the expected behavior based on `fillstyle`.

### Cause of the Bug:
- The bug is caused by the incorrect handling of the `fillstyle` attribute in the `MarkerStyle` class. The absence of a proper check for handling `fillstyle='none'` leads to markers not being rendered hollow as expected.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
- Add a check for handling `fillstyle` appropriately in the `_recache` function and ensure that the markers are rendered correctly as per the provided fill style.
- Implement the `is_filled()` method in the `MarkerStyle` class to distinguish between filled and unfilled markers.

### Corrected Version:
```python
class MarkerStyle():
    def _recache(self):
        if self._marker_function is None:
            return
        self._path = _empty_path
        self._transform = IdentityTransform()
        self._alt_path = None
        self._alt_transform = None
        self._snap_threshold = None
        self._joinstyle = 'round'
        self._capstyle = 'butt'
        self._filled = not (self._fillstyle == 'none')  # Check if filled based on fillstyle
        self._marker_function()

    def is_filled(self):
        return self._filled  # Check if the marker is filled

    def get_fillstyle(self):
        return self._fillstyle
```

Now, with the corrected version of the `MarkerStyle` class, the provided failing test `test_marker_fillstyle` should pass successfully, and the issue reported on GitHub should be resolved.
