### Analyzing the buggy function and the GitHub issue:

1. The buggy function `_recache` in the `MarkerStyle` class of `markers.py` is responsible for updating the internal attributes of a marker style. It sets default values if the `marker_function` is None.

2. The failing test `test_marker_fillstyle` in `test_marker.py` checks if the `fillstyle` attribute of a `MarkerStyle` object is correctly set to `'none'` and whether the marker is filled or not.

3. The GitHub issue reports that setting `fillstyle='none'` does not make markers hollow when using `ax.scatter()`. The user expects a hollow marker but does not get the desired output.

### Identified potential error locations:
- The bug might be related to how the `filled` attribute is handled in the `_recache` function.
- The `marker_function` may not be correctly applied after setting the attributes.

### Cause of the bug:
The bug occurs because the `_recache` function does not properly handle the `filled` attribute when setting the marker style to hollow. This leads to markers not appearing as hollow when expected.

### Strategy for fixing the bug:
To fix this issue, we need to ensure that the `filled` attribute is correctly set to `False` when the `fillstyle` is set to `'none'`.

### Corrected version of the function:
```python
class MarkerStyle():

    def _recache(self):
        if self._marker_function is None:
            return
        
        self._path = _empty_path
        self._transform = IdentityTransform()
        self._alt_path = None
        self._alt_transform = None
        self._snap_threshold = None
        self._joinstyle = 'round'
        self._capstyle = 'butt'
        self._filled = self._fillstyle != 'none'  # Setting filled based on fillstyle
        self._marker_function()
```

After applying this correction, the `MarkerStyle` object will correctly handle the `filled` attribute based on the `fillstyle` parameter, and the markers should appear as hollow when `fillstyle='none'` is set.
