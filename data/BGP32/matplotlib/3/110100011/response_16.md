### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_recache` is part of the `MarkerStyle` class in the `markers.py` file of the `matplotlib` library.
2. The test function `test_marker_fillstyle` is supposed to test the functionality of setting the fillstyle to 'none' for a marker using `MarkerStyle`.
3. The issue on GitHub reports that setting `MarkerStyle`'s fillstyle to 'none' does not make the markers hollow as expected.
4. The bug in the `_recache` function is that it does not correctly handle the condition when `_marker_function` is not None.
5. The failing test suggests that the `is_filled` method may not be working as intended with the fillstyle set to 'none'.

### Bug Cause:
The bug in the original `_recache` function is that it directly calls `_marker_function` without any conditional check. This causes unexpected behavior when it should not be executing anything based on the condition. This incorrect behavior leads to the marker not being set with the intended fillstyle.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Update the `_recache` function to check if `_marker_function` is not None before calling it.
2. Make sure to handle all attributes properly when setting the fillstyle to 'none' to ensure that the marker appears hollow.

### Corrected Version:
```python
class MarkerStyle():

    def _recache(self):
        if self._marker_function is None:
            return
        self._path = _empty_path
        self._transform = IdentityTransform()
        self._alt_path = None
        self._alt_transform = None
        self._snap_threshold = None
        self._joinstyle = 'round'
        self._capstyle = 'butt'
        self._filled = self.get_fillstyle() != 'none'
        self._marker_function()
``` 

By setting the `_filled` attribute based on the fillstyle value and ensuring that the `_marker_function` is only called when it should be, the corrected version of the `_recache` function should now handle the fillstyle correctly.
