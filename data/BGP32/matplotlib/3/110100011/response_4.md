The buggy function `_recache` in the `MarkerStyle` class is not correctly handling the case where the `_marker_function` is not None, resulting in unexpected behavior when setting markers to be hollow.

### Analysis:
1. The `_recache` function initializes various attributes of the `MarkerStyle` instance, but it attempts to call `self._marker_function()` without ensuring that it's a valid function.
2. This behavior leads to issues when setting `fillstyle='none'`, as the intended functionality is not being achieved.

### Bug Cause:
The bug causes the markers not to be hollow when setting `fillstyle='none'` because the `_marker_function` is not being properly checked before calling it.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Check if `_marker_function` exists before calling it in the `_recache` function.
2. If `_marker_function` exists, proceed with the correct marker setup.
3. If `_marker_function` is None, handle the situation appropriately without making any further modifications.

### Corrected Version of the `_recache` function:
```python
class MarkerStyle():
    
    def _recache(self):
        if self._marker_function is None:
            return
        
        self._path = _empty_path
        self._transform = IdentityTransform()
        self._alt_path = None
        self._alt_transform = None
        self._snap_threshold = None
        self._joinstyle = 'round'
        self._capstyle = 'butt'
        self._filled = True
        
        if callable(self._marker_function):
            self._marker_function()
```

By making this modification, the `MarkerStyle` class will now correctly handle the situation when `_marker_function` is None, avoiding unexpected behavior when setting markers to be hollow.
