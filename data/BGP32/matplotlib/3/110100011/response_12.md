### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_recache` is part of the `MarkerStyle` class in the `markers.py` file of the `matplotlib` library.
2. The failing test `test_marker_fillstyle` is checking if the marker style's fillstyle is correctly set to 'none', but it fails due to the bug.
3. The bug causes the markers to not appear as hollow when using `ax.scatter()` with `markers.MarkerStyle()` and setting `fillstyle='none'`. The `MarkerStyle` class is not handling the 'none' `fillstyle` correctly.
4. To fix the bug, we need to ensure that when `fillstyle='none'`, the markers are rendered as hollow. This can be done by modifying the `_recache` function's logic.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
In the `_recache` function, we should check if `fillstyle` is set to 'none' and adjust the rendering of the markers accordingly. We can update the `_recache` function to properly handle the 'none' `fillstyle` to achieve the desired hollow markers.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
# The declaration of the class containing the corrected function
class MarkerStyle():

    # The corrected version of the buggy function
    def _recache(self):
        if self._marker_function is None:
            return
        self._path = _empty_path
        self._transform = IdentityTransform()
        self._alt_path = None
        self._alt_transform = None
        self._snap_threshold = None
        self._joinstyle = 'round'
        self._capstyle = 'butt'
        if self.get_fillstyle() == 'none':
            self._filled = False
        else:
            self._filled = True
        self._marker_function()
    
```

After applying this correction, the `MarkerStyle` class will properly handle the 'none' fillstyle, rendering the markers as hollow when required. This will resolve the issue reported on GitHub and allow the failing test `test_marker_fillstyle` to pass successfully.
