### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_recache` in the `MarkerStyle` class is responsible for resetting certain attributes before calling the `_marker_function`. The issue seems to be related to the behavior of the `fillstyle` attribute when set to `'none'`.

2. The potential error location within the buggy function is where the `fillstyle` is not being correctly handled while setting up the marker properties.

3. The cause of the bug is that the `fillstyle='none'` setting is not handled properly in the `_recache` function, leading to the markers not being hollow as expected. This behavior is confirmed by the failing test in the test file and the GitHub issue raised by a user experiencing the same problem.

4. To fix the bug, we need to update the `_recache` function to correctly handle the setting of `fillstyle` to `'none'` and ensure that the markers are indeed hollow when the `MarkerStyle` is created with this configuration.

### Fix:
```python
class MarkerStyle():

    def _recache(self):
        if self._marker_function is None:
            return
        self._path = _empty_path
        self._transform = IdentityTransform()
        self._alt_path = None
        self._alt_transform = None
        self._snap_threshold = None
        self._joinstyle = 'round'
        self._capstyle = 'butt'
        self._filled = True
        if self.get_fillstyle() == 'none':
            self._filled = False
        self._marker_function()
```

### Updated Test Function:
The test function provided should now pass with the corrected `MarkerStyle` implementation.

```python
def test_marker_fillstyle():
    marker_style = MarkerStyle(marker='o', fillstyle='none')
    assert marker_style.get_fillstyle() == 'none'
    assert not marker_style.is_filled()
```

With this fix, the `MarkerStyle` class will correctly handle the `fillstyle='none'` setting, ensuring that markers are rendered as hollow when created with this configuration.
