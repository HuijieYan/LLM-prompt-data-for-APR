### Analysis:
1. The given buggy function `_recache` is a method of the `MarkerStyle` class in `markers.py`.
2. The function resets several attributes of the `MarkerStyle` instance and then calls `self._marker_function()`, which seems to be intended to update the marker's appearance.
3. The failing test `test_marker_fillstyle` checks if `MarkerStyle` with marker 'o' and fillstyle 'none' returns the expected fillstyle and the filled status.
4. The GitHub issue states that setting `fillstyle='none'` does not produce hollow markers when used with `ax.scatter()`, indicating a bug in the `_recache` function.

### Bug Cause:
- The cause of the bug is in the `_recache` function where `self._marker_function()` is called without checking if it exists. If `_marker_function` is not defined, it results in an error or unexpected behavior.
- The GitHub issue reflects the problem observed when trying to set markers to 'none' fillstyle but not getting the desired hollow markers.

### Fix Strategy:
- Check if `_marker_function` is not None before invoking it in `_recache`.
- Update the function to handle cases where `_marker_function` is not defined to prevent unexpected behavior.

### Corrected Version:
```python
class MarkerStyle():

    def _recache(self):
        if self._marker_function is None:
            return
        self._path = _empty_path
        self._transform = IdentityTransform()
        self._alt_path = None
        self._alt_transform = None
        self._snap_threshold = None
        self._joinstyle = 'round'
        self._capstyle = 'butt'
        self._filled = True
        if self._marker_function:
            self._marker_function()
```

### Note:
- The corrected version includes a check before calling `_marker_function`.
- This change ensures that the function is only called if it exists, preventing unexpected behavior when `_marker_function` is not defined.

The corrected version should address the issue reported in GitHub and make the failing test pass successfully.
