### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_recache` in the `MarkerStyle` class is supposed to initialize certain attributes when called. However, there seems to be an issue with the way `_marker_function` is being called.
2. The failing test `test_marker_fillstyle` checks if the `fillstyle` of a `MarkerStyle` object is set correctly to `'none'`.
3. The GitHub issue indicates that setting `fillstyle` to `'none'` does not result in hollow markers as expected when using `ax.scatter()`.

### Bug Cause:
The bug occurs because the `_marker_function` is being called incorrectly within the `_recache` function. It should be assigned to a local variable and then called like a method, instead of being called directly as a function.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to correctly assign the `_marker_function` to a local variable and then call it like a method after checking if it's not `None`.

### Corrected Version:
```python
class MarkerStyle():

    def _recache(self):
        if self._marker_function is not None:
            self._path = _empty_path
            self._transform = IdentityTransform()
            self._alt_path = None
            self._alt_transform = None
            self._snap_threshold = None
            self._joinstyle = 'round'
            self._capstyle = 'butt'
            self._filled = True
            self._marker_function()
```

By making this correction, the `_recache` function will now properly check if the `_marker_function` is not `None` before calling it, which should resolve the issue and pass the failing test.
