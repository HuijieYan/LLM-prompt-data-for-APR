### Analysis:
- The buggy function `_recache()` is part of the `MarkerStyle` class in the `markers.py` file of the `matplotlib` library.
- The failing test `test_marker_fillstyle()` tries to create a `MarkerStyle` object with `fillstyle='none'` and validate if it is filled or not.
- The GitHub issue reports that setting `fillstyle='none'` does not result in hollow markers as expected.

### Potential Error Locations:
- The issue could be related to how the `_recache()` function handles the `fillstyle`.
- The `_marker_function` call might not be correctly setting up the marker properties.

### Bug Cause:
- The bug occurs because the `_recache()` function does not handle the `fillstyle` property, leading to the markers not being rendered as expected.
- The failing test tries to verify the behavior related to `fillstyle`, which the current implementation does not support.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
- Modify the `_recache()` function to correctly handle the `fillstyle` property by updating the marker properties based on the fill style set.
- Ensure that the `_marker_function` correctly sets the marker properties including `fillstyle`.

### Corrected Version:
```python
# The corrected _recache() function with additional handling for fillstyle
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    
    if self.get_fillstyle() == 'none':
        self._filled = False
    else:
        self._filled = True
    
    self._marker_function()
```

This corrected version updates the `_recache()` function to handle the `fillstyle` property by setting the `_filled` attribute based on the fill style. The additional condition ensures that if `fillstyle='none'`, the markers are rendered as hollow.

By making this change, the `MarkerStyle` class should behave as expected, resolving the issue reported on GitHub.
