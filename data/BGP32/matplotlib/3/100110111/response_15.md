### Analysis
1. The buggy function `_recache` is setting `_filled` to `True` unconditionally, which is incorrect when the `fillstyle` is set to `'none'`.
2. The failing test `test_marker_fillstyle` asserts that the marker should not be filled, but due to the bug in `_recache`, the marker is still being filled.

### Bug Cause
The bug is caused by the `_filled` attribute being set to `True` unconditionally in the `_recache` function, even when the `fillstyle` is set to `'none'`. This leads to the marker being filled instead of hollow as expected.

### Fixing the Bug
To fix the bug, we need to update the `_recache` function to set the `_filled` attribute based on the `fillstyle` parameter provided.

### Corrected Version
```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    self._filled = self._fillstyle != 'none'
    self._marker_function()
```

With this correction, the `_filled` attribute will be set based on the `fillstyle` parameter, allowing markers with `fillstyle='none'` to be correctly rendered as hollow.

This fix addresses the issue reported in the GitHub and ensures that the marker properly respects the fillstyle set by the user.
