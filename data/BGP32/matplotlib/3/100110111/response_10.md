### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_recache` sets various attributes to default values and then calls the `_marker_function()` method. In the failing test `test_marker_fillstyle`, the assertion `assert not marker_style.is_filled()` fails, indicating that the `is_filled` method does not return the expected value.
2. The `is_filled` method is likely related to the `self._filled` attribute set in the `_recache` function, which should be set to `False` based on the expected values.
3. The failing test expects that `marker_style.is_filled()` should return `False`, but it is currently returning `True`. This discrepancy suggests that the `_filled` attribute is not correctly set to `False` as expected in the `_recache` function.
4. To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the `_filled` attribute is correctly set to `False` in the `_recache` function.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Update the `_recache` function to correctly set the `_filled` attribute to `False`.
2. Make sure that the `is_filled` method correctly reflects the value of the `_filled` attribute.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    self._filled = False  # Set filled to False
    self._marker_function()
```

By updating the `_recache` function to set the `_filled` attribute to `False`, the corrected version should address the issue and make the failing test `test_marker_fillstyle` pass successfully.
