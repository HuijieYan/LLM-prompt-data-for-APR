### Analysis:
The buggy function `_recache` sets the `_filled` attribute to `True` unconditionally, which contradicts the expected behavior when `fillstyle='none'`. This leads to the failing test `assert not marker_style.is_filled()`.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is caused by the `_recache` function unconditionally setting `_filled` to `True`, regardless of the `fillstyle` specified in the `MarkerStyle` object. This results in the marker not being hollow even though `fillstyle='none'`.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to modify the `_recache` function so that it correctly handles the `fillstyle` parameter and sets the `_filled` attribute based on it.

### The corrected version of the function:
```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    self._filled = self._fillstyle.lower() != 'none'
    self._marker_function()
```

By modifying the `_filled` assignment in the `_recache` function to check if the `fillstyle` is not equal to `'none'`, we ensure that the marker is filled only when the fillstyle is set to something other than 'none'. This correction should address the issue described in the GitHub ticket and satisfy the expected input/output values.
