### Analysis
1. The buggy function `_recache` sets some attributes to default values and calls `_marker_function`, which seems essential for updating marker properties. However, in the failing test `test_marker_fillstyle`, the `MarkerStyle` object's `is_filled()` method returns `True` instead of the expected `False`.
2. The bug might be related to the implementation of the `_marker_function` or how `_filled` attribute is being handled.
3. The failing test indicates that setting `fillstyle='none'` should result in a marker that is not filled. This implies that the `_filled` attribute should be `False` when `fillstyle` is set to `'none'`.
4. We need to ensure that when `fillstyle='none'`, the `_filled` attribute is set to `False` to represent a non-filled marker.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that when `fillstyle='none'`, the `_filled` attribute is properly updated to `False`. This adjustment should be made within the `_recache` function when setting the attributes based on the `fillstyle`.

### Corrected Function
```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    
    if self.get_fillstyle() == 'none':
        self._filled = False
    else:
        self._filled = True
    
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    self._marker_function()
```

By adjusting the `_recache` function to consider the `fillstyle` when setting the `_filled` attribute, we ensure that the marker's fill status aligns with the expected behavior as indicated in the failing test.
