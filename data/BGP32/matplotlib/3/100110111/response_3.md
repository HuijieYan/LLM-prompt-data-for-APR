### Analysis
The buggy function _recache() is failing to properly set the `_filled` attribute to False, resulting in the MarkerStyle objects being considered as filled when they should be hollow. This issue is highlighted by the failing test `test_marker_fillstyle()`.

### Potential Error Location
The potential error lies in the assignment of the `_filled` attribute to True unconditionally at the end of the `_recache()` function.

### Cause of the Bug
The cause of the bug is the incorrect assignment of the `_filled` attribute to True within the `_recache()` function. This causes the MarkerStyle objects to be treated as filled when the intended behavior is for them to be hollow.

The failing test `test_marker_fillstyle()` expects that `is_filled()` should return False for a MarkerStyle object with the fillstyle set to 'none'. However, due to the erroneous assignment of `_filled` to True in the buggy function, `is_filled()` returns True instead, leading to the assertion failure.

### Fixing the Bug
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the `_filled` attribute is set correctly based on the fillstyle provided during the creation of the MarkerStyle object. We can modify the _recache() function to set `_filled` to False when the fillstyle is 'none'.

### Corrected Version
```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    self._filled = self._fillstyle != 'none'  # Corrected line
    self._marker_function()
```

By correcting the assignment of `_filled` based on the fillstyle provided during the creation of the MarkerStyle object, we ensure that the correct filled/hollow behavior is maintained. This fix should address the issue reported on GitHub and allow the failing test `test_marker_fillstyle()` to pass successfully.
