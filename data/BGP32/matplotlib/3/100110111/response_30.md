## Analysis
The buggy function is `_recache` which is expected to reset the marker properties to default values and call the `_marker_function`. The failing test `test_marker_fillstyle` checks if the `is_filled` method of `MarkerStyle` returns the expected value based on the `fillstyle` parameter. The error message shows that the `is_filled` method is returning `True` unexpectedly.

The expected values and types provide insights into the correct behavior of the function, detailing the expected values of parameters and instance variables.

The GitHub issue indicates that the `fillstyle='none'` setting does not result in hollow markers as expected.

## Potential Error Locations
1. Setting `self._filled = True` unconditionally could be causing the issue if it is directly related to the filled state of the marker.
2. The `_filled` attribute might not be in sync with the `fillstyle` parameter being passed.
3. The logic to determine whether a marker is filled or not might be incorrect.

## Bug Cause
The `_filled` attribute is unconditionally set to `True` in the `_recache` function, which is a default filled value for markers. This leads to the `is_filled` method always returning `True` even when the `fillstyle` is set to `'none'`.

## Strategy for Fixing the Bug
1. Update the `_recache` function to use the `fillstyle` parameter to set the `_filled` attribute accordingly.
2. Modify the logic in `_recache` to handle the hollow markers correctly based on the `fillstyle`.

## Corrected Version
```python
# The corrected version of the _recache function
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    self._filled = self._fillstyle != 'none'
    self._marker_function()
```

By updating the `_filled` attribute based on the `fillstyle` parameter provided, the corrected version should now correctly handle the hollow marker scenario when `fillstyle='none'`.

With this correction, the failing test `test_marker_fillstyle` should now pass as expected.
