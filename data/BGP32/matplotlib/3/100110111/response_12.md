### Analyzing the buggy function and failing test

The buggy function `_recache` in `markers.py` is called when the `MarkerStyle` object is created. It initializes various attributes of the object, including `_path`, `_transform`, `_filled`, etc. The failing test `test_marker_fillstyle` creates a `MarkerStyle` object with `fillstyle='none'` and checks if the `is_filled()` method returns `False`.

The failing test fails because the `is_filled()` method is not implemented correctly in the buggy version of the function. The `filled` attribute is set to `True` during `_recache`, causing the `is_filled()` method to always return `True`.

### Identifying potential error locations

The cause of the bug lies in the initialization of the `_filled` attribute in the `_recache` function. It is always set to `True`, regardless of the `fillstyle` passed to the `MarkerStyle` object.

### Suggesting a strategy for fixing the bug

To fix the bug, we need to make sure that the `_filled` attribute is set based on the `fillstyle` parameter passed to the `MarkerStyle` object. If the `fillstyle` is 'none', then `_filled` should be `False`.

### Corrected version of the function

```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    self._filled = self._fillstyle != 'none'
    self._marker_function()
```

By updating the initialization of the `_filled` attribute based on the `fillstyle` parameter, the corrected version of the function should now correctly reflect whether the marker is filled or not, resolving the issue reported on GitHub and passing the failing test case.
