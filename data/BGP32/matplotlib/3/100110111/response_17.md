### Analysis
1. The buggy function `_recache` in the `markers.py` file is intended to reset certain attributes to default values when needed. However, it seems to be missing the proper handling of the `fillstyle` attribute.
2. The failing test `test_marker_fillstyle` uses a custom `MarkerStyle` with `fillstyle='none'` and checks if the marker is filled or not.
3. The error message points to a failure in asserting the marker is not filled, indicating a problem with the `is_filled` method of `MarkerStyle`.
4. The issue on GitHub suggests that setting `fillstyle='none'` does not produce a hollow marker as expected when using `ax.scatter`, indicating a potential bug in the `_recache` function related to the `fillstyle` handling.
5. To fix the bug, we need to ensure that when `fillstyle='none'`, the marker is hollow as expected.

### Bug Cause
The bug is likely caused by not properly handling the `fillstyle` attribute in the `_recache` function. When `fillstyle='none'`, the `is_filled` method should return `False`, but it might not be implemented correctly in the current version.

### Fix Strategy
1. Check the current implementation of the `is_filled` method in `MarkerStyle`.
2. Add a proper handling for `fillstyle='none'` in the `_recache` function that adjusts the filled status accordingly.
3. Make sure to test the modified function with the failing test.

### Corrected Version
```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    if self._fillstyle == 'none':
        self._filled = False
    else:
        self._filled = True
    self._marker_function()
```

By adding the condition to check `fillstyle` before setting the `filled` attribute, we can ensure that when `fillstyle='none'`, the marker is considered hollow. This correction should address the issue reported on GitHub and make the failing test pass.
