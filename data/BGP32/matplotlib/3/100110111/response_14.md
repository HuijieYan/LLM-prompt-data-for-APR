### Analysis
The buggy function `_recache` is not correctly initializing the `_filled` attribute to `False` as expected, which leads to the `MarkerStyle` being filled when it should not be. The failing test is checking the `is_filled` method of the `MarkerStyle` instance, which should return `False` when `fillstyle` is set to `'none'`.

### Bug Cause
The bug is caused by the `_recache` function not setting the `_filled` attribute to `False`, causing the `is_filled` method to return `True` instead of `False`. This results in the failing test assertion error.

### Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the `_filled` attribute is correctly initialized to `False` when the `fillstyle` is set to `'none'`. We can achieve this by updating the `_recache` function to set `_filled` based on the `fillstyle` value.

### Corrected Version
```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    self._filled = self._fillstyle != 'none'
    self._marker_function()
```

By updating the `_recache` function with the corrected version above, the issue reported in the GitHub bug will be resolved, and the failing test will pass as expected.
