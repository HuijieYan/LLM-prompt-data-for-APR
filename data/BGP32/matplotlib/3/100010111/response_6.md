## Analyzing the buggy function

The buggy function `_recache` is called within the `MarkerStyle` class and is responsible for resetting certain attributes to default values. One of the issues causing the failing test is related to the `is_filled` method returning `True` instead of the expected result `False`, indicating that the markers are not hollow as intended.

The cause of this bug can be traced back to the `_recache` function setting `self._filled` to `True` unconditionally. This leads to the incorrect behavior when checking if the marker is filled or not.

To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the `self._filled` attribute is correctly set based on the `fillstyle` parameter passed during the creation of the `MarkerStyle` object.

## Fixing the bug

We will update the `_recache` function to properly handle the `fillstyle` parameter and determine the value of the `_filled` attribute accordingly.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    self._filled = self._fillstyle != 'none'
    self._marker_function()
```

Now, the corrected function takes into account the `fillstyle` parameter when setting the `_filled` attribute, ensuring that it reflects the intention of the user when creating the `MarkerStyle` object.

This fix should resolve the issue described in the GitHub problem and make the markers hollow when the `fillstyle` is set to `'none'`.
