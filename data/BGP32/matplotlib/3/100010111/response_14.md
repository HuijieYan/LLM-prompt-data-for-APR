### Analysis
The bug is likely in the `is_filled()` method of the `MarkerStyle` class in the `_recache()` function. The `assert not marker_style.is_filled()` is failing, indicating that the `is_filled()` method is returning `True` when it should be `False`.

The `is_filled()` method is likely using the `_filled` attribute, which is set to `False` in the `_recache()` function. The bug may be due to how the `MarkerStyle` class handles the `fillstyle` parameter.

### Bug Cause
The `_filled` attribute is set to `True` by default in the `_recache()` function, which may be incorrect if `fillstyle='none'`. This leads to the `is_filled()` method returning `True`, causing the test to fail.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug
1. Update the `_recache()` function to correctly handle the `fillstyle` parameter and set `_filled` accordingly.
2. Make sure that when `fillstyle='none'`, `_filled` is set to `False`.
3. Ensure that the `is_filled()` method correctly reflects the state of `_filled`.

### Corrected Version
```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    self._filled = self._fillstyle != 'none'
    self._marker_function()
```

In the corrected version above, we set `_filled` based on the `fillstyle` parameter, ensuring that the correct value is assigned. This should resolve the issue and the failing test related to `is_filled()`.
