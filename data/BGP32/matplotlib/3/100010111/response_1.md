### Analysis
The error message indicates that the `is_filled` method of the `MarkerStyle` object is returning `True` when it should be returning `False` after setting the `fillstyle` to `'none'`. This suggests that the `is_filled` method is not working correctly, potentially due to the `self._filled` attribute not being set correctly in the `_recache` method.

### Bug Explanation
In the buggy `_recache` method, the `_filled` attribute is always set to `True`, causing the `is_filled` method to return `True` regardless of the `fillstyle`. This results in the failing test where the expectation is for the marker to be hollow (`fillstyle='none'`) but it is still treated as filled due to the incorrect setting of `_filled`.

### Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the `_filled` attribute reflects the actual fill status of the marker determined by the `fillstyle`. We should update the `_filled` attribute based on the value of `self._fillstyle` in the `_recache` method.

### Corrected Version
```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: lib/matplotlib/markers.py

def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    self._filled = self._fillstyle != 'none'
    self._marker_function()
```

In the corrected version, the `_filled` attribute is set based on the value of `self._fillstyle`, ensuring that the `is_filled` method will return the correct value according to the marker's fill status. This should resolve the issue and pass the failing test.
