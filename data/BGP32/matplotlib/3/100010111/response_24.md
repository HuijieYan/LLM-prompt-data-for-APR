## Analysis
The buggy function `_recache` in the `markers.py` file is responsible for setting up marker properties such as path, transformation, fill style, join style, cap style, and whether the marker should be filled. The error message indicates that the function is not correctly handling the `is_filled` method, leading to the failure of the `test_marker_fillstyle` test.

The expected input value is `'none'` for the `self._fillstyle` parameter. However, the function is setting `_filled` to `True` unconditionally, which is causing the `is_filled` method to return `True` when it should be `False` based on the context.

## Bug Cause
The bug is caused by setting `_filled` to `True` unconditionally in the `_recache` function. This leads to the `is_filled` method always returning `True` instead of reflecting the actual fill status determined by the `fillstyle`.

## Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to update the `_filled` attribute based on the `self._fillstyle` parameter value. If the `fillstyle` is `'none'`, then `_filled` should be set to `False`. This will align the internal state with the desired fill style behavior.

## Corrected Version
```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    self._filled = self._fillstyle != 'none'
    self._marker_function()
```

By updating the `_filled` attribute based on the `self._fillstyle` value, the corrected function will ensure that the `is_filled` method behaves as expected, leading to the passing of the `test_marker_fillstyle` test and addressing the issue reported on GitHub.
