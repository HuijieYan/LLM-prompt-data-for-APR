### Analysis
- The buggy function `_recache(self)` initializes several attributes of a MarkerStyle object.
- The failing test `test_marker_fillstyle()` checks if the method `is_filled()` returns False when the fillstyle is set to 'none'.
- The failing test indicates that the `is_filled()` method is returning True instead of False, which leads to the AssertionError.

### Error Cause
- The cause of the bug is that the `is_filled()` method is not properly implemented to reflect the `fillstyle` attribute of the MarkerStyle object. The `_filled` attribute is set to True unconditionally in the `_recache(self)` which causes the issue.

### Fix Strategy
- To fix the bug, we need to update the `_filled` attribute based on the `fillstyle` parameter provided during the MarkerStyle initialization.
- Modify the `is_filled()` method to return the correct value based on the `fillstyle`.

### Updated Function
```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    self._filled = self._fillstyle != 'none'
    self._marker_function()
```

### Improved `is_filled()` Method
```python
def is_filled(self):
    return self._filled
```

By updating the `_recache(self)` function to set the `_filled` attribute correctly based on the `fillstyle`, and ensuring that the `is_filled()` method returns the expected value, the bug should be fixed. This should address the issue raised on GitHub and ensure that the failing test passes successfully.
