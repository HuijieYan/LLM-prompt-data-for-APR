## Analysis
The buggy function `_recache` is intended to reset several instance variables to their default values. The error message indicates that the `is_filled` method is returning `True` when it should be returning `False`. This discrepancy points to a potential issue in the resetting of the `_filled` variable within the function.

The expected input values for this bug fix involve ensuring that the fillstyle is set to `'none'` and that the `_filled` variable is set to `False`.

## Bug Cause
The cause of the bug lies in the function `_recache`. When resetting the `_filled` variable, it is set to `True` instead of `False`, leading to the `is_filled` method incorrectly returning `True`.

## Fix Strategy
To fix this bug, we need to ensure that when resetting the `_filled` variable, it is correctly set to `False` to indicate that the marker should not be filled.

## The corrected version of the function
```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    self._filled = False  # Corrected to set _filled to False
    self._marker_function()
```

By setting `_filled` to `False` in the `_recache` function, the MarkerStyle instance will correctly indicate that the marker should not be filled, resolving the issue raised in the failing test case and the GitHub issue.
