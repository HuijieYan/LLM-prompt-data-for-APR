### Analysis
The `_recache` function is supposed to reset certain attributes of the MarkerStyle object to their initial values. The bug in the function is that it is not correctly updating the `_filled` attribute based on the `_fillstyle` attribute.

### Error Cause
The error message indicates that `assert not True` is failing, which means the `is_filled` method is returning True when it should be False. This is likely due to the `_filled` attribute not being updated correctly based on the `_fillstyle`.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug
To fix the bug, we need to update the `_filled` attribute based on the `_fillstyle` attribute. If the `_fillstyle` is `'none'`, then `_filled` should be set to `False`.

### Corrected Version of the Function
```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    self._filled = self._fillstyle != 'none'
    self._marker_function()
```

By updating the `_filled` attribute based on the `_fillstyle`, the corrected version of the function should now correctly handle cases where `fillstyle='none'` and the `is_filled` method should return False in that scenario.
