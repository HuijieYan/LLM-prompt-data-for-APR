### Analysis
The buggy function `_recache` is supposed to handle the re-caching of marker attributes. In the failing test case, the issue arises when a custom `MarkerStyle` object is created with a fillstyle of `'none'`, but the `is_filled()` method fails to return the expected result.

### Identified Issues
1. The `_filled` attribute is always initialized to `True`, which is incorrect when the fillstyle is set to `'none' in a MarkerStyle` object.
2. The `_filled` attribute is not updated based on the fillstyle set for the `MarkerStyle` object.

### Cause of the Bug
The bug occurs because the `_filled` attribute is always set to `True` by default in the `_recache` function, regardless of the fillstyle specified in the `MarkerStyle` object. This leads to incorrect output when calling the `is_filled()` method.

### Suggested Fix Strategy
1. Update the `_recache` function to set the `_filled` attribute based on the `MarkerStyle` object's fillstyle.
2. Ensure that the `_filled` attribute reflects the correct fill status according to the assigned fillstyle.

### The Corrected Version of the Function
```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    
    # Update filled status based on fillstyle
    if self._fillstyle == 'none':
        self._filled = False
    else:
        self._filled = True
    
    self._marker_function()
```

By updating the `_recache` function to correctly handle the `_filled` attribute based on the assigned fillstyle, the issue reported on GitHub should be resolved, and the failing test should pass successfully.
