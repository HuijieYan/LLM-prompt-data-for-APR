### Analysis
The bug occurs in the `_recache` method of the `MarkerStyle` class. The issue is related to the `is_filled` method returning `True` instead of `False` when the `fillstyle` is set to `'none'`. This results in the failing test asserting that the marker is filled when it should not be.

### Error Cause
The bug is caused by the `is_filled` method not correctly handling the `'none'` fillstyle set by the user. The `_recache` method does not properly update the `self._filled` attribute based on the `fillstyle` parameter provided.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to make sure that the `is_filled` method correctly checks if the marker should be filled based on the `fillstyle` parameter. We should update the `_recache` method to set `self._filled` accordingly. 

### Corrected Version

```python
class MarkerStyle:
    def _recache(self):
        if self._marker_function is None:
            return
        self._path = _empty_path
        self._transform = IdentityTransform()
        self._alt_path = None
        self._alt_transform = None
        self._snap_threshold = None
        self._joinstyle = 'round'
        self._capstyle = 'butt'
        
        # Update _filled based on fillstyle
        self._filled = self._fillstyle != 'none'
        
        self._marker_function()
    
    def is_filled(self):
        return self._filled
    
    def get_fillstyle(self):
        return self._fillstyle
```

By updating the `_recache` method to correctly set `self._filled` based on the `fillstyle`, we ensure that the `is_filled` method returns the correct value. This corrected version should pass the failing test and satisfy the expected input/output values.
