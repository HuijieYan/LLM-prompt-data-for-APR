### Analysis
The buggy function `_recache` is setting the `_filled` attribute to `True` regardless of the `fillstyle` parameter. This leads to incorrect behavior when checking if the marker is filled or not. The failing test is checking for a marker with `fillstyle='none'` to be considered unfilled. However, the buggy function sets `_filled` to `True` unconditionally.

### Bug Cause
The bug is caused by the unconditional setting of `_filled` to `True` in the `_recache` function. This contradicts the intended behavior of the `fillstyle` parameter when creating a `MarkerStyle` object.

### Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to adjust the `_filled` attribute based on the `fillstyle` parameter provided during the creation of the `MarkerStyle` object. If the `fillstyle` is set to `'none'`, the marker should be considered unfilled (`_filled = False`).

### Corrected Version
```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    self._filled = self._fillstyle != 'none'  # Adjust filled status based on fillstyle
    self._marker_function()
```

By updating the line `self._filled = self._fillstyle != 'none'` in the `_recache` function, we ensure that the `_filled` attribute reflects the correct status based on the `fillstyle` parameter provided when creating the `MarkerStyle` object. This correction should address the issue reported on GitHub and make the `is_filled()` method behave as expected.
