1. **Analysis**:
   - The buggy function `_recache` is called within the `MarkerStyle` class to reinitialize certain attributes.
   - The error message indicates that the function `is_filled()` returns `True` when it should have returned `False`.
   - The `marker_style` object is instantiated with `'fillstyle'` set to `'none'`, so `is_filled()` should return `False`.
   - The GitHub issue suggests that setting `fillstyle='none'` did not lead to hollow markers as expected.

2. **Error Location**:
   - The bug is likely in the `_recache` function where the `_filled` attribute is incorrectly initialized.

3. **Bug Cause**:
   - The `_filled` attribute is set to `True` by default in the `_recache` function, regardless of the specified `fillstyle`. This results in `is_filled()` returning `True` even when `'none'` fillstyle is selected.
   - This bug causes markers to be filled when `fillstyle='none'` is expected to create hollow markers.

4. **Bug Fix Strategy**:
   - Update the `_filled` attribute based on the selected `fillstyle` to ensure that it correctly reflects whether the marker should be filled or not.

5. **Corrected Version**:

```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    self._filled = self._fillstyle != 'none'
    self._marker_function()
```

In the corrected version, the `_filled` attribute is set based on whether the `fillstyle` is `'none'`, ensuring that the `is_filled()` function behaves correctly. This correction should resolve the issue reported on GitHub and make the `is_filled()` function return the expected result.
