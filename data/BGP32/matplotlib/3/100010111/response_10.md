### Analysis
The buggy function `_recache` initializes various attributes of `MarkerStyle` class, but it fails to correctly set the `_filled` attribute based on the `fillstyle` provided. This causes the `is_filled()` method to return `True` even when `fillstyle` is set to `'none'`.

### Bug Cause
The bug is caused by not updating the `_filled` attribute based on the `fillstyle` provided to the `MarkerStyle` object. The `_filled` attribute is always being set to `True` by default in the `_recache` function, making `is_filled()` method return `True` even when it should be `False` based on the `fillstyle`.

### Fix Strategy
1. Update the `_filled` attribute based on the provided `fillstyle`.
2. Set `_filled` to `False` when `fillstyle` is set to `'none'`.
3. Ensure that `_filled` reflects the state of the fill style accurately.

### The corrected version of the function

```python
# The corrected version of the 'recache' function
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    
    # Update _filled attribute based on fillstyle
    if self._fillstyle == 'none':
        self._filled = False
    else:
        self._filled = True
        
    self._marker_function()
```

By updating the `_recache` function to correctly set the `_filled` attribute based on the `fillstyle`, the test case related to `is_filled()` method should now pass as expected.
