### Analysis:
1. The function `_recache` resets several attributes to default values and then calls a marker function (`self._marker_function`). The error message indicates that the `is_filled` method returns `True` when it should return `False`.
2. The bug seems to be related to the `_filled` attribute not being set correctly.
3. The cause of the bug is that the `_filled` attribute is not reset to `False` as expected, leading to the `is_filled` method returning `True`.
4. To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the `_filled` attribute is set to `False` in the `_recache` function.

### Correction:
```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    self._filled = False  # Corrected: Set to False
    self._marker_function()
```

By setting `_filled` to `False` in the `_recache` function, we ensure that the `is_filled` method will return the correct value (`False`) when needed.
