## Analysis
The buggy function `_recache` in the `markers.py` file of the `matplotlib` library is not correctly updating the `_filled` attribute based on the `fillstyle` provided to the `MarkerStyle` object. This leads to unexpected behavior when checking if the marker is filled or not.

### Error Location
The issue lies in the incorrect initialization of the `_filled` attribute in the `_recache` function.

### Cause of the Bug
The bug is causing the `_filled` attribute to stay `True` regardless of the `fillstyle` set in the `MarkerStyle` object. This issue is evident from the failing test, as it expects the marker to be hollow (`is_filled()` should return `False`) but it is currently returning `True` due to the bug.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the `_filled` attribute is correctly updated based on the `fillstyle` set in the `MarkerStyle` object during the `_recache` process.

### Bug Fix
Below is the corrected version of the `_recache` function:

```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    self._filled = self._fillstyle != 'none'
    self._marker_function()
```

By updating the `_filled` attribute based on the `fillstyle` value, the function now correctly represents the expected behavior where a fill-style of `'none'` will result in the marker not being filled (`_filled` is `False`), and any other fill-style will result in the marker being filled (`_filled` is `True`).
