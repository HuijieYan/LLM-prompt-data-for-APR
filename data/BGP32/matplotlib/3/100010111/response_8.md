### Analysis
The error message indicates that the `is_filled()` method is returning `True` instead of `False` when the `fillstyle` is set to `'none'`. This behavior is not expected according to the input parameters and the intention of the test.

### Error Location
The issue seems to be related to the `_recache` method where the `_filled` attribute is set to `True` unconditionally.

### Cause of the Bug
The bug occurs because the `_filled` attribute in MarkerStyle is being set to `True` by default in the `_recache` method, which is incorrect when `fillstyle` is set to `'none'`. This leads to the incorrect behavior where `is_filled()` returns `True` instead of `False`.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug
To fix the bug, the `_filled` attribute should respect the `fillstyle` parameter in the MarkerStyle constructor. If `fillstyle` is set to `'none'`, then `_filled` should be set to `False`.

### Corrected Version

```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    self._filled = self.get_fillstyle() != 'none'
    self._marker_function()
```

By modifying the setting of the `_filled` attribute based on the `fillstyle`, the corrected version of the `_recache` function ensures that the `is_filled()` method behaves as expected, passing all the test cases and resolving the GitHub issue.
