### Analysis
The buggy function `_recache(self)` is called within the `MarkerStyle` class from the `markers.py` file in Matplotlib. The function is supposed to update certain attributes of `MarkerStyle` based on the provided parameters. The error message is related to the method `is_filled()`, which is expected to return `False` when `fillstyle='none'`. However, the current implementation is causing this method to return `True`.

### Potential Error Location
The issue lies in the way the `_filled` attribute is being set in the `_recache()` function. In the current implementation, regardless of the `fillstyle` parameter value, `_filled` is always set to `True`.

### Cause of the Bug
The bug is caused by the improper setting of the `_filled` attribute based on the `fillstyle` parameter. This results in the `is_filled()` method incorrectly returning `True` when the expected behavior is to return `False` when `fillstyle='none'`.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug
To fix the bug, we need to update the `_filled` attribute based on the `fillstyle` parameter provided when creating a `MarkerStyle` object. We should ensure that when `fillstyle='none'`, `_filled` is set to `False` as expected.

### Corrected Version
```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    
    # Update _filled based on the fillstyle parameter
    if self._fillstyle == 'none':
        self._filled = False
    else:
        self._filled = True
        
    self._marker_function()
```

### Expected Corrected Function Behavior
The corrected function will update the `_filled` attribute based on the `fillstyle` parameter value provided during the creation of a `MarkerStyle` object. When `fillstyle='none'`, `_filled` will be set to `False`, ensuring that the `is_filled()` method returns the correct value.

By making this change, the corrected function will satisfy the expected input/output values and resolve the issue reported on GitHub regarding markers not being hollow when setting `fillstyle='none'`.
