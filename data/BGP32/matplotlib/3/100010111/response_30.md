### Analysis
The buggy function `_recache` in the `markers.py` file is supposed to reset various attributes of a marker style object. However, the bug occurs when the `_filled` attribute is set to `True` by default, causing issues with marker styles that are supposed to be hollow.

The failing test is related to checking if a marker style is filled or not, but due to the default setting of `_filled` to `True`, the test fails incorrectly. The expected behavior should be that the `fillstyle='none'` should result in a hollow marker.

### Bug Location
The bug is located in the line `self._filled = True` in the `_recache` function, where it is incorrectly setting the `_filled` attribute to `True`.

### Bug Cause
The cause of the bug is that the `_filled` attribute is set to `True` by default. This leads to markers being filled even when the fillstyle is set to `'none'`.

### Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that when the `fillstyle` is set to `'none'`, the `_filled` attribute is also set to `False`. This will ensure that markers with `'none'` fillstyle are rendered as hollow.

### Corrected Version
```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    self._filled = self._fillstyle != 'none'
    self._marker_function()
```

By modifying the line `self._filled = self._fillstyle != 'none'`, the corrected version sets the `_filled` attribute based on the condition that the fillstyle is not equal to `'none'`. This will ensure that markers appear correctly based on their fillstyle setting.
