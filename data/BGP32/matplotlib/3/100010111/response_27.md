### Analysis
- The buggy function `_recache` is failing to correctly set the `_filled` attribute based on the fillstyle specified in the MarkerStyle.
- The failing test case is checking for the `is_filled` method to return `False` when the fillstyle is set to `'none'`, but it's currently failing because the `_filled` attribute is not being updated accordingly.
- The expected input for this case is a MarkerStyle with marker set to 'o' and fillstyle set to 'none'.

### Bug Cause
- The bug is caused by the `_filled` attribute not being updated based on the fillstyle specified in the MarkerStyle.
- The `_filled` attribute is always set to `True` by default but should be set to `False` when the fillstyle is 'none'.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug
- Update the `_recache` function to correctly set the `_filled` attribute based on the specified fillstyle in the MarkerStyle.

### Corrected Version
```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return

    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    
    # Update _filled attribute based on fillstyle
    self._filled = self._fillstyle != 'none'

    self._marker_function()
```

With this correction, the `_filled` attribute will be set correctly based on the specified fillstyle in the MarkerStyle, resolving the failing test case and aligning with the expected behavior.
