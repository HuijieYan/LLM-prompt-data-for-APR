### Analysis
- The `_recache` function is intended to reset certain attributes to default values. However, the bug lies in the incorrect setting of the `_filled` attribute to `True` during the recaching process.
- The failing test is checking if the marker style is filled or not. The issue arises because `is_filled()` method returns `True` due to `_filled` being set to `True` in the buggy function.
- The expected behavior is that when `fillstyle='none'` is set, the marker style should be hollow or not filled.

### Bug Cause
- The bug is caused by setting `_filled = True` unconditionally in the `_recache` function, regardless of the `fillstyle` being set to `none`. This leads to the incorrect behavior of the marker style being considered as filled.

### Fix Strategy
- Update the `_recache` function to correctly set the `_filled` attribute based on the `fillstyle` parameter. If `fillstyle='none'`, then `_filled` should be set to `False`.

### The corrected version of the function
```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    self._filled = self._fillstyle != 'none'
    self._marker_function()
```

By making this change, the `_filled` attribute will be set based on the `fillstyle` parameter, ensuring that the marker style behaves as expected when `fillstyle='none'`.
