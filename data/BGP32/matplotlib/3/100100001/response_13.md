## Analysis:
The buggy function `_recache` does not handle the situation where the `_marker_function` is not None correctly. It immediately calls `_marker_function` without any checks or validation. This behavior can lead to unexpected errors, especially if `_marker_function` is not defined properly.

## Bug Explanation:
In the failing test `test_marker_fillstyle`, the `MarkerStyle` is initialized with `fillstyle='none'`. The `is_filled()` method is expected to return False because `fillstyle='none'`. However, due to the buggy `_recache` function, unexpected behavior can occur, and the test may fail even though it was expected to pass.

## Fix Strategy:
- Check if `_marker_function` is not None before calling it.
- Modify the `_recache` function to validate `_marker_function` before execution.
- Follow proper error handling practices to avoid unexpected behavior.

## Corrected Version:
```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: lib/matplotlib/markers.py

def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is not None:
        self._path = _empty_path
        self._transform = IdentityTransform()
        self._alt_path = None
        self._alt_transform = None
        self._snap_threshold = None
        self._joinstyle = 'round'
        self._capstyle = 'butt'
        self._filled = True
        self._marker_function()
```

By adding a check for the existence of `_marker_function`, the corrected version of the `_recache` function ensures that the function is only called when it is properly defined. This modification prevents unexpected behavior and fixes the bug that was causing the failing test.
