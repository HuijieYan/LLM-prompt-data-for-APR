The bug in the `_recache` function is that it tries to call `self._marker_function()` without checking if it is valid or defined, which may lead to errors when the function is None. To fix this bug, we should add a check to ensure that `_marker_function` is not None before attempting to call it.

Here is the corrected version of the `_recache` function with the necessary check:

```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    self._filled = True
    if callable(self._marker_function):
        self._marker_function()
```

By adding the `if callable(self._marker_function)` check before calling `self._marker_function()`, we ensure that the function is valid and callable before trying to execute it.

This corrected version of the `_recache` function should pass the failing test `test_marker_fillstyle` without any issues.
