The bug in the `_recache` function lies in the part where it calls `self._marker_function()` assuming it is callable. However, this can lead to errors if `_marker_function` is not actually a function.

To fix this bug, we need to check whether `self._marker_function` is callable before trying to execute it.

Here is the corrected version of the `_recache` function:

```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    
    if callable(self._marker_function):
        self._path = _empty_path
        self._transform = IdentityTransform()
        self._alt_path = None
        self._alt_transform = None
        self._snap_threshold = None
        self._joinstyle = 'round'
        self._capstyle = 'butt'
        self._filled = True
        self._marker_function()
    else:
        raise TypeError("Invalid marker function provided.")
```

With this updated version, we first check if `_marker_function` is callable using `callable(self._marker_function)`. If it is callable, then we proceed with the reassignment of attributes and calling the function. If it is not callable, a TypeError is raised.

This correction ensures that the function only executes if `_marker_function` is a valid callable object, preventing potential errors.
