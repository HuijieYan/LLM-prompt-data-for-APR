The issue in the `_recache` function is that it directly calls `_marker_function` without checking if it exists. This can result in a `TypeError` if `_marker_function` is not defined. 

To fix this, we need to add a check to ensure that `_marker_function` exists before calling it.

Here is the corrected version of the `_recache` function:

```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: lib/matplotlib/markers.py

def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None or not callable(self._marker_function):
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    self._filled = True
    self._marker_function()
```

With this correction, the `_recache` function will now only call `_marker_function` if it exists and is callable, preventing the `TypeError`.

This fix should make the failing test pass without any errors.
