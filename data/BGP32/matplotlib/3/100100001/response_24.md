## Analysis:
The `_recache` function is supposed to reset certain attributes of a marker style object and then call a specific marker function. The bug seems to be related to the call to `_marker_function` without checking if it is defined or not. This can lead to an AttributeError if `_marker_function` is not set before calling `_recache`.

## Bug cause:
The bug arises from calling `_marker_function` without checking if it is defined or not. This can lead to an AttributeError when the function tries to execute a non-existent function.

## Fix strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that `_marker_function` is not `None` before calling it in the `_recache` function. We can add a check to see if `_marker_function` exists before calling it to avoid any AttributeError.

## The corrected version of the function:

```python
# The corrected version of the buggy function
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    self._filled = True
    self._marker_function()
```

By making this change, we ensure that the `_marker_function` is only called if it is not `None`, thus preventing any AttributeError from occurring. This corrected version should now pass the failing test successfully.
