The issue in the buggy function `_recache` is that it calls the `_marker_function()` without first checking if it is defined. This leads to an error when `_marker_function` is None, as it cannot be called.

### Cause of the bug:
The buggy function `_recache` assumes that `_marker_function` will always be defined before calling it. When `_marker_function` is None, it tries to call it, causing an error.

### Fix strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to add a check to ensure that `_marker_function` is not None before calling it.

### Corrected version of the function:
```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is not None:
        self._marker_function()
        self._path = _empty_path
        self._transform = IdentityTransform()
        self._alt_path = None
        self._alt_transform = None
        self._snap_threshold = None
        self._joinstyle = 'round'
        self._capstyle = 'butt'
        self._filled = True
```

By adding the check `if self._marker_function is not None`, we ensure that `_marker_function` is only called when it is defined, preventing the error. This corrected version should pass the failing test `test_marker_fillstyle()` without any issues.
