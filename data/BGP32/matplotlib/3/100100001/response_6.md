## Analysis:
The `_recache` function is intended to reset certain attributes of a MarkerStyle object, including `_path`, `_transform`, and others. However, the bug lies in the statement `self._marker_function()` which is supposed to update the marker path and transform but doesn't appear to be correctly implemented.

## Potential Error Location:
The issue seems to be with the implementation of `self._marker_function()` where it should update the marker path and transform attributes but currently does not seem to be performing this task correctly.

## Cause of the Bug:
The bug causes the MarkerStyle object to not correctly update the marker path and transform attribute, resulting in a failure to correctly indicate the fill style and whether the marker is filled in the failing test.

## Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the `_marker_function()` actually updates the marker path and transform attributes as intended when calling the `_recache` function.

## Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    self._filled = True
    if self._marker_function:
        self._marker_function(self)
```

By adding `self` as an argument to the `_marker_function()` call and checking whether `_marker_function` is not None before calling it, we ensure that the marker path and transform will be correctly updated when `_recache` is called, resolving the bug.
