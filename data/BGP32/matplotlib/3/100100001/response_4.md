### Analysis:
- The `_recache` function seems to be responsible for resetting certain attributes to default values. 
- The `self._marker_function()` call at the end of the function indicates that it is supposed to invoke a marker function to recache the marker properties.
- The bug might be caused by not correctly updating properties when calling the marker function.

### Bug Cause:
- The bug seems to be related to the way marker properties are updated in the `_recache` function. 
- It might not correctly handle updating the `_filled` attribute based on the marker function call.

### Fix Strategy:
- Check the marker function to ensure it correctly updates all relevant marker properties, including `_filled`.
- Modify the `_recache` function to properly update all marker attributes before and after calling the marker function.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    self._filled = True
    
    # Update marker properties before calling marker function
    self._marker_function()
    
    # Update marker properties after calling marker function, including _filled
    self._filled = self._path.should_solid_fill()
```

By updating the `_filled` attribute after calling the marker function, we ensure that the correct fill status is handled, which should resolve the bug.
This corrected version should pass the failing test `test_marker_fillstyle`.
