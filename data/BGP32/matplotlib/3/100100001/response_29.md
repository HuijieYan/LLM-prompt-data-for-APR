### Analysis:
1. The `_recache` function is trying to set initial values for various attributes related to markers in matplotlib.
2. The bug seems to be that it is calling `self._marker_function()` without defining what it should do.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is caused by the `_marker_function` attribute being called without being defined anywhere. This will lead to an AttributeError when `_recache` is executed.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
1. Define a function or method that can be set as the `_marker_function` attribute to ensure that the function call inside `_recache` works correctly.
2. The corrected function should set appropriate values for the attributes related to markers in matplotlib.

### Corrected Version:
```python
# The corrected version of the buggy function
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    self._filled = True
    self._marker_function(self)
```

In this corrected version, I added `self` as a parameter to the `_marker_function` call to pass the marker object to the function. This modification ensures that the function has access to the marker object to set its attributes correctly.
