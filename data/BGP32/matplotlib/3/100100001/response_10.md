### Analysis:
The `_recache` function is intended to reset certain attributes of a MarkerStyle instance. The bug seems to lie in the condition for checking if `_marker_function` is defined before executing it.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is caused by the condition `if self._marker_function is None:`, which should be checking if `_marker_function` is *not* None before executing it.

### Fix Strategy:
Change the condition to check if `_marker_function` is not None before calling it.

### Corrected Version:
```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: lib/matplotlib/markers.py

def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is not None:
        self._path = _empty_path
        self._transform = IdentityTransform()
        self._alt_path = None
        self._alt_transform = None
        self._snap_threshold = None
        self._joinstyle = 'round'
        self._capstyle = 'butt'
        self._filled = True
        self._marker_function()
``` 

After applying this fix, the failing test `test_marker_fillstyle` should pass successfully.
