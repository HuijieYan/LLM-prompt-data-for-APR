## Analysis:
The `_recache` function in the `markers.py` file is supposed to update various attributes related to markers. However, there is a potential issue with setting the `_filled` attribute to `True` unconditionally, which may cause incorrect behavior when creating markers with `fillstyle='none'`.

## Bug Cause:
The bug occurs because the `_filled` attribute is always set to `True` in the `_recache` function, which contradicts the expected behavior when `fillstyle='none'`. This inconsistency causes the failing test `test_marker_fillstyle` to fail.

## Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to update the `_filled` attribute based on the fillstyle specified for the marker. If the fillstyle is set to 'none', then `_filled` should be set to `False`. This adjustment will ensure that the marker is rendered correctly according to the specified fillstyle.

## Corrected Version:
Here is the corrected version of the `_recache` function:

```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    self._filled = self.fillstyle != 'none'
    self._marker_function()
```

By updating the `_filled` attribute based on the fillstyle specified for the marker, the corrected version of the `_recache` function ensures that the marker is rendered correctly according to the fillstyle. This change should address the bug and allow the failing test `test_marker_fillstyle` to pass successfully.
