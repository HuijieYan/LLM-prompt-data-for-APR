The bug in the `_recache` function is that it calls `self._marker_function()` without checking if `self._marker_function` is actually a valid function. This can lead to a `NoneType` object error if `self._marker_function` is not defined in certain cases.

To fix this bug, we should add a check to ensure that `self._marker_function` is not `None` before calling it. Here's the corrected version of the `_recache` function:

```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is not None and callable(self._marker_function):
        self._path = _empty_path
        self._transform = IdentityTransform()
        self._alt_path = None
        self._alt_transform = None
        self._snap_threshold = None
        self._joinstyle = 'round'
        self._capstyle = 'butt'
        self._filled = True
        self._marker_function()
```

With this check in place, the function will only call `self._marker_function()` if it is defined and callable, avoiding any `NoneType` errors. This correction should ensure that the failing test `test_marker_fillstyle()` passes successfully.
