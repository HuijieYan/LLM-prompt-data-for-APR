### Analysis:
- The `_recache` function initializes certain attributes of a marker object.
- The function calls `_marker_function`, assuming it is defined and will update the marker properties accordingly.
- The failing test `test_marker_fillstyle` is checking that marker fillstyle is set correctly.

### Bug Cause:
- The bug seems to be related to the fact that `_marker_function` is not defined or not correctly updating the marker properties causing the test to fail.

### Bug Fix:
- Define or update `_marker_function` to correctly set marker properties based on the marker style.
- Make sure that `_marker_function` is called after setting marker properties correctly.

### Corrected Version:
```python
# The corrected version of the function
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    self._filled = True
    self._marker_function()
```
