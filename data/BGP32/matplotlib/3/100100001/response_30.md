The buggy function `_recache` in the file `markers.py` is failing to properly set the `fillstyle` property of the `MarkerStyle` object. This is evident in the failing test `test_marker_fillstyle` in the file `test_marker.py`.

The cause of the bug is that the `_filled` attribute is always being set to `True` in the `_recache` function, regardless of the `fillstyle` specified when creating the `MarkerStyle` object.

To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the `_filled` attribute reflects the actual fillstyle set in the `MarkerStyle` object. We can achieve this by updating the `_recache` function to set `_filled` based on the value of the `fillstyle` property.

Here is the corrected version of the `_recache` function:

```python
# The corrected version of _recache function
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    self._filled = self._fillstyle != 'none'
    self._marker_function()
```

With this correction, the `_recache` function will set the `_filled` attribute based on the `fillstyle` specified in the `MarkerStyle` object, allowing the correct behavior as expected by the failing test.

After making this change, running the failing test `test_marker_fillstyle` should now pass successfully.
