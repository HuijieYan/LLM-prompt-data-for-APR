The bug in the `_recache` function lies in the fact that it is calling `self._marker_function()` without checking if it is a callable function. This leads to `TypeError` when trying to call the function that might not be assigned properly. 

To fix this bug, we need to add a check to ensure that `self._marker_function` is callable before trying to call it.

Here is the corrected version of the `_recache` function:

```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: lib/matplotlib/markers.py

# The corrected version of the function
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is not None and callable(self._marker_function):
        self._path = _empty_path
        self._transform = IdentityTransform()
        self._alt_path = None
        self._alt_transform = None
        self._snap_threshold = None
        self._joinstyle = 'round'
        self._capstyle = 'butt'
        self._filled = True
        self._marker_function()
```

With this correction, the `_recache` function will only call `self._marker_function()` if it is both not `None` and a callable function. This ensures that no `TypeError` will be raised, and the failing test case `test_marker_fillstyle` will pass as expected.
