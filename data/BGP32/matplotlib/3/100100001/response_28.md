The bug in the `_recache` function lies in the line `self._marker_function()`, where it attempts to call a function without checking if it exists. This causes a `TypeError` when the function is not defined. To fix this bug, we should include a check to verify if `_marker_function` is not `None` before attempting to call it.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: lib/matplotlib/markers.py

def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is not None:
        self._path = _empty_path
        self._transform = IdentityTransform()
        self._alt_path = None
        self._alt_transform = None
        self._snap_threshold = None
        self._joinstyle = 'round'
        self._capstyle = 'butt'
        self._filled = True
        self._marker_function()
```

With this correction, the `_recache` function will only call `_marker_function()` if it is not `None`, preventing the `TypeError` from occurring. This fix should now allow the failing test `test_marker_fillstyle()` to pass successfully.
