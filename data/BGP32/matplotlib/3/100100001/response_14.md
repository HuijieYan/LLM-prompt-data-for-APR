### Analyzing the Buggy Function and Failing Test

The buggy function `_recache` is responsible for resetting certain attributes to their default values and then calling the `_marker_function`. The failing test `test_marker_fillstyle` tests the `fillstyle` attribute of a `MarkerStyle` object to ensure it returns the correct value and checks if the marker is filled.

### Potential Error Locations
- The `_marker_function` might not be defined correctly or is not functioning as expected.
- Initialization of the `marker_style` in the failing test might not be setting the `fillstyle` attribute properly.

### Cause of the Bug
The buggy function `_recache` may not be correctly calling `_marker_function`, leading to unexpected behavior when the test is executed.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug
1. Check if the `_marker_function` is correctly defined and called in the `MarkerStyle` class.
2. Ensure that the `fillstyle` attribute is properly initialized within the `MarkerStyle` class.

### Corrected Version of the Function

```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    self._filled = True
    
    if callable(self._marker_function):  # Check if _marker_function is callable
        self._marker_function()
```

### Changes Made
Added a check to verify if the `_marker_function` is callable before invoking it.

By making this change, the corrected version of the function will accurately call the `_marker_function` if it is defined and callable, ensuring that the intended functionality is executed when `_recache` is called.
