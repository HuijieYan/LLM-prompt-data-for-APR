The issue in the original `_recache` function is that it calls `self._marker_function()` without checking if it exists, which leads to an error if `_marker_function` is not defined. 

To fix this bug, we need to check if `_marker_function` exists before calling it.

Here is the corrected version of the `_recache` function:

```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    self._filled = True
    if callable(self._marker_function):
        self._marker_function()
```

By adding the condition `if callable(self._marker_function):`, we ensure that the function is only called when it is defined and callable. This will prevent the error in the failing test case `test_marker_fillstyle`.
