The buggy function `_recache` does not correctly handle the case when `self._marker_function` is `None`. It should only call `self._marker_function()` when it is not `None` to avoid potential errors.

The bug occurs because the function tries to call `self._marker_function()` even when it is `None`, leading to a `TypeError` due to calling a function that does not exist.

To fix this issue, modify the `_recache` function to check if `self._marker_function` is not `None` before calling it.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is not None:
        self._path = _empty_path
        self._transform = IdentityTransform()
        self._alt_path = None
        self._alt_transform = None
        self._snap_threshold = None
        self._joinstyle = 'round'
        self._capstyle = 'butt'
        self._filled = True
        self._marker_function()
```

With this change, the `_recache` function will now only execute `self._marker_function()` if it is not `None`, which resolves the bug and allows the corrected version to pass the failing test.
