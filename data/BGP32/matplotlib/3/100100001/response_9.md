### Analyzing the buggy function and its relationship with the failing test

The buggy function `_recache` is a method within the `MarkerStyle` class in `lib/matplotlib/markers.py`. It is responsible for re-initializing certain attributes of a `MarkerStyle` instance. The failing test `test_marker_fillstyle` creates a `MarkerStyle` instance with marker='o' and fillstyle='none', then checks if the `get_fillstyle()` method returns 'none' and if `is_filled()` returns False.

### Identifying potential error locations within the buggy function

The issue in the buggy function `_recache` is that it is checking if `_marker_function` is `None`, and if so, it is simply returning without re-initializing certain attributes. However, in the failing test, we are creating a `MarkerStyle` instance with specific attributes that should be set in the `_recache` method.

### Explaining the cause of the bug

The bug occurs because the `_recache` method is skipping the necessary re-initialization of the attributes when `_marker_function` is `None`, which is not aligned with the behavior expected by the failing test.

### Suggesting a strategy for fixing the bug

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the attributes of the `MarkerStyle` instance are properly re-initialized even if `_marker_function` is `None`. This can be done by directly setting the attributes instead of relying on `_marker_function`.

### The corrected version of the function

```python
def _recache(self):
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    self._filled = True
    if self._marker_function is not None:
        self._marker_function()
```

With this correction, even if `_marker_function` is `None`, the necessary attributes will be re-initialized according to the failing test's expectations.
