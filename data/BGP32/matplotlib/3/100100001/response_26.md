## Analysis:
The `_recache` function sets the marker properties to default values and then calls the `_marker_function`. In the provided code snippet, the `_marker_function` is assumed to be a method or function that performs some operation related to markers. However, the bug lies in the fact that the `_marker_function` is not defined within the `_recache` function or passed as an argument, causing the code to fail.

## Bug Cause:
The bug occurs due to the missing definition or passing of the `_marker_function` within the `_recache` function. Since the `_marker_function` is not provided, calling it leads to an error, resulting in the failing test.

## Bug Fix:
To fix the bug, a valid `_marker_function` should be defined or passed as an argument to the `_recache` function. This way, when `_recache` is called, the marker properties are set to default values, and then the `_marker_function` is executed correctly.

## Corrected Version:
```python
# The corrected version replaces the buggy function with a fixed version

# this is the corrected function
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    self._filled = True
    self._marker_function()
``` 

In this corrected version, the `_marker_function` is assumed to be defined or passed correctly. This should resolve the bug and allow the function to execute without errors, passing the failing test.
