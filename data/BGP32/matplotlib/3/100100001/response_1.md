The bug in the `_recache` function is that it is checking if `self._marker_function is None` before setting all the attributes to default values. This can lead to incomplete initialization if `_marker_function` is not None.

The corrected version of the `_recache` function should set all the attributes to default values regardless of the value of `_marker_function`.

```python
def _recache(self):
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    self._filled = True
    if self._marker_function is not None:
        self._marker_function()
```

By making sure that all the attributes are set to default values before calling `_marker_function`, we ensure that the object is properly initialized before any custom function is executed.

This corrected version should pass the failing test `test_marker_fillstyle()` successfully.
