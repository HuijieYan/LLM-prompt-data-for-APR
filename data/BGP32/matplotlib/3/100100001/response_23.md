The buggy function `_recache` in `markers.py` has an issue where it calls `self._marker_function()` without checking if it is defined in the first place. This could lead to a `NoneType` error if `_marker_function` is not set for a particular marker style.

To fix this bug, we need to ensure that `_marker_function` is defined before calling it in the `_recache` function. We can add a check to only call `_marker_function` if it is not `None`.

Here is the corrected version of the `_recache` function:

```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is not None:
        self._path = _empty_path
        self._transform = IdentityTransform()
        self._alt_path = None
        self._alt_transform = None
        self._snap_threshold = None
        self._joinstyle = 'round'
        self._capstyle = 'butt'
        self._filled = True
        self._marker_function()
```

By adding the conditional check `if self._marker_function is not None:` we ensure that `_marker_function` is only called when it is defined. This should prevent any `NoneType` errors and allow the corrected function to pass the failing test `test_marker_fillstyle()` in `test_marker.py`.
