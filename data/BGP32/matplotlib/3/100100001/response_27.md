The buggy function `_recache` sets the `_filled` attribute to `True` without considering the `fillstyle` attribute that might override it to be `none`. This leads to a situation where the marker should not be filled, but it ends up being filled due to the hardcoded `True` value.

To fix this bug, we need to consider the `fillstyle` attribute when setting the `_filled` attribute. If the `fillstyle` is `'none'`, then `_filled` should be set to `False`.

Here is the corrected version of the `_recache` function:

```python
# The corrected version of the buggy function
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    self._filled = self._fillstyle != 'none'
    self._marker_function()
```

With this correction, the `_filled` attribute will be set according to the `fillstyle`, ensuring that markers are filled only when the `fillstyle` is not `'none'`.

This fix should make the failing test `test_marker_fillstyle` pass as it now correctly checks the `fillstyle` of the marker.
