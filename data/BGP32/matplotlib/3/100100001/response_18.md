The bug in the `_recache` function occurs when it calls `self._marker_function()` without checking if it exists. This causes an AttributeError when the function is not defined, as it tries to call a non-existent function.

To fix this bug, we need to first check if `self._marker_function` is not `None` before attempting to call it. This can be done using an `if` statement to handle this condition.

Here is the corrected version of the `_recache` function:
```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    self._filled = True
    self._marker_function()
```

With this fix, the `_recache` function will only call `self._marker_function()` if it is not `None`, avoiding the AttributeError and allowing the corrected version to pass the failing test.
