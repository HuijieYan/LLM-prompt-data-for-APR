## Analysis:
The `_recache` function is intended to reset certain attributes of marker styles in a matplotlib package. The bug seems to be related to how the `_marker_function` is being handled.

## Error Location:
The bug is likely located in the `if self._marker_function is None:` condition. It should potentially check if the `_marker_function` attribute exists instead of whether it is None before calling it.

## Cause of the Bug:
The bug occurs because the `_marker_function` is being called without checking if it exists, leading to a potential AttributeError if it is not defined.

## Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
Check if the `_marker_function` attribute exists before calling it to avoid potential errors related to attribute access.

## Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def _recache(self):
    if hasattr(self, '_marker_function') and callable(self._marker_function):
        self._path = _empty_path
        self._transform = IdentityTransform()
        self._alt_path = None
        self._alt_transform = None
        self._snap_threshold = None
        self._joinstyle = 'round'
        self._capstyle = 'butt'
        self._filled = True
        self._marker_function()
``` 

By adding `hasattr(self, '_marker_function')` and checking if `self._marker_function` is callable before executing it, we can ensure that the function will only be called if it exists and is callable. This should prevent the AttributeError and fix the bug that caused the test to fail.
