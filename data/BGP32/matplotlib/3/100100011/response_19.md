### Analysis:
The buggy function `_recache` is supposed to initialize some attributes of the MarkerStyle class, including setting `self._filled` to True by default. This causes the markers to be filled even when `fillstyle='none'` is set.

### Error Location:
The bug is likely caused by setting `self._filled = True` unconditionally in the function `_recache`.

### Cause of the Bug:
The bug occurs because the `_filled` attribute is always set to True, overriding the `fillstyle='none'` setting which is intended to make the markers hollow.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the `_filled` attribute is set based on the `fillstyle` parameter when initializing the MarkerStyle. If `fillstyle='none'`, then `_filled` should be set to False.

### The Corrected Version:
Here is the corrected version of the `_recache` function:

```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    self._filled = False if self._fillstyle == 'none' else True  # Set _filled based on fillstyle
    self._marker_function()
```

With this correction, the `_filled` attribute will be set to False when `fillstyle='none'`, allowing markers to be hollow as intended.

By applying this fix to the MarkerStyle class, the failing test `test_marker_fillstyle` should pass as expected.
