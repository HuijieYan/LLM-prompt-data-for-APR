### Analysis:
1. The `_recache` function is intended to reset various attributes of the marker style.
2. The issue reported on GitHub indicates that setting `fillstyle='none'` using `markers.MarkerStyle` does not result in a hollow marker as expected.
3. The failing test `test_marker_fillstyle` is checking for the fill style using the `get_fillstyle` method, which should return `'none'` for a marker with `fillstyle='none'` set.
   
### Cause of the Bug:
The bug seems to be in the implementation of the `_recache` function. When the fillstyle is set to `'none'`, the `_filled` attribute is not being updated to reflect that the marker should be hollow. This leads to markers still being filled even when `fillstyle='none'` is set.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix this bug, the `_recache` function should update the `_filled` attribute based on the `fillstyle` set in the `MarkerStyle`.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    self._filled = self.get_fillstyle() != 'none'
    self._marker_function()
```

After making this correction in the `_recache` function, the test `test_marker_fillstyle` should pass, and the markers will appear hollow when `fillstyle='none'` is set.
