## Analysis
The `_recache` function is responsible for reinitializing the properties of the `MarkerStyle` object. The issue arises from the fact that setting `fillstyle='none'` does not correctly handle the case where the marker should be empty. This is evident from the failing test where it expects the marker to be hollow but it is not.

## Bug Cause
The bug is caused by the `_recache` function always setting `_filled = True`, regardless of the `fillstyle` being set to `'none'`. This leads to the marker being filled instead of being empty as expected.

## Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to update the `_recache` function to correctly handle the scenario where `fillstyle` is set to `'none'`. We should check the `fillstyle` value before setting `_filled` property to ensure the correct behavior.

## The corrected version
```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    self._filled = self._fillstyle != 'none'
    self._marker_function()
```

By updating the `_filled` property to check the value of `_fillstyle`, we ensure that the marker is correctly filled or empty based on the `fillstyle` parameter. With this correction, the `MarkerStyle` object behaves as expected when the `fillstyle` parameter is set to `'none'`.
