### Analysis:
1. The `_recache` function in the `markers.py` file is responsible for initializing the marker properties.
2. The test function `test_marker_fillstyle` from `test_marker.py` verifies the `fillstyle` property of a `MarkerStyle` object.
3. The GitHub issue reports that setting `fillstyle='none'` does not result in hollow markers as expected.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is likely caused by the `_filled = True` property being set to `True` in the `_recache` function, which overrides the desired behavior of having hollow markers.

### Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to modify the `_recache` function so that the `_filled` property is set to `False` when `fillstyle='none'`.

### Corrected Version:
```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: lib/matplotlib/markers.py

def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    
    # Update _filled property based on fillstyle
    if self.get_markerfacecolor() == 'none':
        self._filled = False
    else:
        self._filled = True
    
    self._marker_function()
```

Now, when the `fillstyle` is set to `'none'`, the `_filled` property will be set to `False`, allowing the markers to be hollow as expected.

The corrected version of the function should resolve the issue reported in GitHub and pass the failing test.
