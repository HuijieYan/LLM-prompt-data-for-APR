### Analysis:
1. The `_recache` function in `markers.py` is responsible for resetting marker attributes to default values when necessary.
2. The failing test `test_marker_fillstyle` checks if the `fillstyle` attribute of a `MarkerStyle` object is correctly set to `'none'`.
3. The GitHub issue reports that setting `fillstyle='none'` does not result in hollow markers as expected when using `ax.scatter()`.

### Error location:
The issue seems to be with the handling of the `fillstyle` attribute in the `_recache` function. The function resets the `_filled` attribute to `True` unconditionally, which causes markers to be filled even when `fillstyle='none'`.

### Cause of the bug:
The bug occurs because the `_filled` attribute is set to `True` by default, and it is not updated based on the `fillstyle`.

### Strategy for fixing the bug:
To fix the bug, we need to update the `_filled` attribute based on the `fillstyle` provided in the `MarkerStyle` object. If `fillstyle` is `'none'`, then `_filled` should be set to `False` to create hollow markers.

### Corrected version of the function:
```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    self._filled = self._fillstyle != 'none'  # Update _filled based on fillstyle
    self._marker_function()
```

By updating the `_filled` attribute based on the `fillstyle`, the corrected function ensures that markers are correctly filled or hollow based on the provided `fillstyle` attribute.
