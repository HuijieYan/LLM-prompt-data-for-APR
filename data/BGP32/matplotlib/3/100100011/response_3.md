### Analysis:
The `_recache` function is expected to initialize the marker properties, but the bug lies in the fact that it always calls `self._marker_function()` at the end, regardless of whether `_marker_function` is `None` or not. This leads to unexpected behavior, especially when creating custom marker styles.

### Bug Cause:
The bug causes the `self._marker_function()` to be called even when `self._marker_function` is `None`, which was the case in the `MarkerStyle` initialization for setting `fillstyle='none'` to make markers hollow.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
1. Modify the `_recache` function to only call `self._marker_function()` if it is not `None`.
2. Update the function to handle the case where `self._marker_function` is `None` gracefully and not interfere with custom marker styles.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    self._filled = True
    if self._marker_function:
        self._marker_function()
``` 

By making this change, the bug should be fixed, and the custom marker style with `fillstyle='none'` should work correctly, which will resolve the issue mentioned in the GitHub report.
