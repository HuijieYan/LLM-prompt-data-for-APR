The issue in the `_recache` function is that it resets the `_filled` attribute to `True` unconditionally, which contradicts the intention of setting a marker's fillstyle to 'none'.

The strategy for fixing the bug would be to modify the `_recache` function to correctly handle the marker's fillstyle attribute and ensure that it reflects the desired behavior.

Here is the corrected version of the `_recache` function:

```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: lib/matplotlib/markers.py

def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'

    if self.get_fillstyle() == 'none':
        self._filled = False
    else:
        self._filled = True

    self._marker_function()
```

With this correction, the `_recache` function will check the marker's fillstyle attribute and set the `_filled` attribute accordingly. This change ensures that when the fillstyle is set to 'none', the marker will be hollow as intended.

The corrected code should now pass the failing test `test_marker_fillstyle` and resolve the issue reported on GitHub regarding markers not being hollow when `fillstyle` is set to 'none'.
