## Analysis:
The `_recache` function in the `markers.py` file is responsible for re-caching marker properties. However, in the current implementation, even if the `fillstyle` is set to `'none'`, the `_filled` attribute is still set to `True`, which causes markers to appear filled when they should be hollow.

## Identified Bug:
The bug lies in the `_recache` function where the `_filled` attribute is always set to `True`, regardless of the `fillstyle` set in the `MarkerStyle`.

## Cause of the Bug:
The bug occurs because the `_filled` attribute is always set to `True` by default in the `_recache` function, which overrides the `fillstyle='none'` setting made in the `MarkerStyle`.

## Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to update the `_filled` attribute based on the `fillstyle` specified in the `MarkerStyle`.

## Corrected Version:
```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    self._filled = self._fillstyle != 'none'  # Update _filled based on fillstyle
    self._marker_function()

# Update _recache function to set _filled based on the fillstyle specified in MarkerStyle
```

By updating the `_filled` attribute based on the `fillstyle` specified in the `MarkerStyle`, the corrected version of the `_recache` function ensures that markers appear hollow when `fillstyle='none'` is set. This correction will address the issue reported on GitHub and make the failing test pass.
