### Analysis:
The `_recache` function is designed to reset the marker properties and call the marker function if it exists. However, the bug lies in the `_filled` property being set to `True` unconditionally. This causes the markers to always be filled regardless of the specified `fillstyle`.

### Identified Issue:
The bug is in the line `self._filled = True`, where the `_filled` property is set to `True` without considering the `fillstyle` specified in the marker style.

### Cause of the Bug:
The cause of the bug is that the property `_filled` is always set to `True` in the `_recache` function, leading to markers being filled despite setting `fillstyle='none'`.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to update the `_recache` function to set the `_filled` property based on the `fillstyle` specified in the marker style.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    self._filled = self.get_fillstyle() != 'none'
    self._marker_function()
```

With the corrected version of the `_recache` function, the `self._filled` property will be set based on the `fillstyle` specified in the marker style. This change will ensure that markers are correctly filled or hollow based on the provided `fillstyle`.
