## Analysis:
The buggy function `_recache` is responsible for resetting marker properties. The issue arises when trying to set a marker to be hollow by setting `fillstyle='none'` using `MarkerStyle`. The failing test `test_marker_fillstyle` confirms the bug by checking if the fillstyle is set to 'none' and if the marker is hollow. The GitHub issue also highlights this problem when setting the fillstyle to 'none' results in filled markers.

## Bug Cause:
The bug is causing the markers to not appear as hollow when setting `fillstyle='none'` due to incorrect handling of marker properties in the `_recache` function.

## Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to modify the `_recache` function to properly handle setting the fillstyle to 'none' for hollow markers.

## Corrected Version:
```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    self._filled = False  # Changed from True to False to make the marker hollow
    self._marker_function()
```

By changing the `_filled` property to False, we ensure that the markers will appear hollow when the `fillstyle='none'` is set. This correction will address the bug reported in the failing test and the GitHub issue.
