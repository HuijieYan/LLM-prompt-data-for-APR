### Analysis:
The buggy function `_recache` in `markers.py` is responsible for resetting various attributes related to markers. In this case, it sets `_filled` to `True` unconditionally, which causes markers to always be filled regardless of the `fillstyle`. This results in the failing test `test_marker_fillstyle`.

### Error Location:
- The buggy line: `self._filled = True`

### Cause of the Bug:
The bug arises because the `_filled` attribute is set to `True` without considering the `fillstyle`. This leads to markers being filled even when `fillstyle='none'` is specified.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to update the `_filled` attribute based on the `fillstyle` provided in the `MarkerStyle`. If `fillstyle` is `'none'`, set `_filled` to `False` to ensure that markers are hollow when desired.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    self._filled = self._fillstyle != 'none'
    self._marker_function()
```

By updating the `_filled` attribute based on the `fillstyle` provided in `MarkerStyle`, the corrected version of `_recache` will now ensure that markers are hollow when `fillstyle='none'`. This fix addresses the issue reported on GitHub and makes the failing test `test_marker_fillstyle` pass successfully.
