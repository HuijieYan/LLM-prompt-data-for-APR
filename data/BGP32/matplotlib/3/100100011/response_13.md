## Analysis:
The `_recache` function is responsible for resetting various attributes related to markers. In the buggy version, the `_marker_function()` is called without proper validation. This could lead to issues related to setting up the correct marker style.

## Error location:
The error in the code lies in the unconditional call to `_marker_function()` without checking if it exists or not.

## Cause of the bug:
The bug occurs because the `_marker_function` attribute is not checked before calling it, which can lead to unexpected behavior when setting custom marker styles. This behaviour is evident in the failing test where the marker style is set to 'none' but is not reflected when used in plotting.

## Strategy for fixing the bug:
To fix the bug, we need to add a check to ensure that `_marker_function` is not `None` before calling it in the `_recache` function. This will prevent undesired behavior and allow for proper initialization of marker attributes.

## The corrected version:
```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    self._filled = True
    if callable(self._marker_function):
        self._marker_function()
```

By adding the conditional check `if callable(self._marker_function):` before calling `_marker_function()`, we ensure that the function is only called if it is defined and callable. This correction will prevent any unexpected behavior related to marker styles and should fix the issue described on GitHub.
