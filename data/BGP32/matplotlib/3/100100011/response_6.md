### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_recache` in `markers.py` is responsible for resetting marker properties. It seems that the issue arises when the `fillstyle` property is being handled.
   
2. The failing test `test_marker_fillstyle` directly tests the `fillstyle` property of a `MarkerStyle` instance with a marker 'o' and fillstyle 'none'. This test is intended to check if setting fillstyle to 'none' correctly results in the marker being hollow.

3. The bug causes the marker not to be hollow as expected when the fillstyle is set to 'none'. This behavior contradicts the intended functionality and leads to unexpected visualization outcomes, as reported in the GitHub issue.

4. To fix the bug, we need to ensure that when `fillstyle='none'`, the marker is drawn as hollow, corresponding to an outline only. This fix involves updating the `_recache` function to handle the fillstyle property correctly.

### Bug Fix:
Here is a corrected version of the `_recache` function:

```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    
    self._filled = True if self._fillstyle != 'none' else False
    self._marker_function()
```

With this fix, the `filled` property will be set based on the `fillstyle` value passed to the `MarkerStyle` instance. If `fillstyle` is 'none', the marker will be drawn as hollow (not filled). 

This correction addresses the bug reported in the failing test and the GitHub issue by ensuring that setting `fillstyle='none'` results in hollow markers.
