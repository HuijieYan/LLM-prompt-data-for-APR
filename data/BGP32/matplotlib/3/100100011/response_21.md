### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_recache` is responsible for resetting various attributes of the `MarkerStyle` object, including `_filled`. This attribute controls whether the marker is filled or not.
2. The failing test `test_marker_fillstyle` checks if the `fillstyle` is correctly set to `'none'` and whether the marker is filled or not using the `is_filled()` method.
3. The GitHub issue indicates that setting `fillstyle='none'` does not result in hollow markers as expected, suggesting a potential bug in the implementation of `_recache`.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is caused by the `_recache` function always setting `_filled` to `True` regardless of the `fillstyle` parameter.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to update the `_recache` function to correctly handle the `fillstyle` attribute and reflect it in the `_filled` attribute.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    self._filled = self.get_fillstyle() != 'none'
    self._marker_function()
```

After applying this fix, the `_filled` attribute of `MarkerStyle` will accurately represent whether the marker should be filled based on the `fillstyle`.

This correction should resolve the reported issue on GitHub and pass the failing test `test_marker_fillstyle`.
