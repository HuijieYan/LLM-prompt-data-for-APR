The bug in the `_recache` function causes the markers not to appear hollow when the `fillstyle` is set to 'none'. This issue is directly related to the failing test `test_marker_fillstyle` where the expectation is that the fillstyle should be 'none' and the marker should not be filled.

The bug occurs because the `_recache` function sets `_filled = True` unconditionally, regardless of the `fillstyle` specified. This overrides the desired behavior of specifying `fillstyle='none'` and causes the markers to be filled.

To fix this bug, we need to update the `_recache` function to consider the `fillstyle` parameter when setting the `_filled` attribute.

Here is the corrected version of the `_recache` function:

```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    self._filled = self._fillstyle != 'none'
    self._marker_function()
```

By updating the `_recache` function to set `_filled` based on the `fillstyle` parameter, the markers will now correctly appear hollow when `fillstyle='none'` is specified.

This fix will address the issue reported on GitHub where markers were not hollow as expected.
