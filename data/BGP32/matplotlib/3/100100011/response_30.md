### Analysis:
The `_recache` function is called internally to reset marker properties. The issue seems to be related to the `fillstyle='none'` not being reflected when setting markers on the plot.

### Potential Error Locations:
The bug might be related to how the `_filled` property is being handled within the `_recache` function.

### Cause of the Bug:
The bug arises from the `_filled` property being set to `True` unconditionally in the `_recache` function, which overrides the `fillstyle='none'` setting, causing the markers to be filled instead of hollow as intended.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to modify the `_recache` function to consider the `fillstyle` parameter when setting the `_filled` property. If `fillstyle` is set to `'none'`, then `_filled` should be set to `False` to display hollow markers.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    self._filled = self.get_fillstyle() != 'none'
    self._marker_function()
```

Now, by checking the `fillstyle` parameter when setting the `_filled` property, the corrected version of the function should pass the failing test and resolve the issue reported on GitHub.
