## Analysis
The `_recache` function is responsible for re-initializing marker attributes, but it does not correctly handle the case where `self._marker_function` is None. This can lead to unexpected behavior when the function is called if the marker function is not properly set.

## Identifying potential error locations
The potential error location is when the `_marker_function` is None and the function should return early without trying to execute it.

## Cause of the bug
The bug is caused by the `_recache` function not checking if `_marker_function` is None before attempting to call it. This results in unexpected behavior when trying to execute a non-existing function.

## Strategy for fixing the bug
To fix the bug, we need to add a check to ensure that `_marker_function` is not None before attempting to call it in the `_recache` function.

## The corrected version of the function
```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    self._filled = True
    self._marker_function()
```

By adding the check before calling `_marker_function`, we ensure that the function is only called if it exists, thus fixing the bug. This corrected version of the function should now handle the case where `_marker_function` is None without causing any issues.
