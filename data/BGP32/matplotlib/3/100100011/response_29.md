### Analysis:
1. The `_recache()` function is responsible for resetting various attributes related to markers.
2. The issue arises when the `fillstyle='none'` is used with the `MarkerStyle` class, but the markers appear filled instead.
3. The bug is caused by the incorrect handling of the `filled` attribute in the `_recache()` function.
4. To fix the bug, we need to ensure that when `fillstyle` is set to `'none'`, the `filled` attribute should be set to `False`.

### Bug Fix:
```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    self._filled = self.get_fillstyle() != 'none'  # Update filled based on fillstyle
    self._marker_function()
```

### Correction Explanation:
In the corrected version, the `filled` attribute is updated based on the `fillstyle` set for the marker style. If `fillstyle` is `'none'`, then `filled` is set to `False`, ensuring that the marker appears hollow as intended. This fix addresses the bug reported in the GitHub issue.

Now, after applying this fix, the marker style with `fillstyle='none'` should render hollow markers, resolving the issue reported in GitHub.
