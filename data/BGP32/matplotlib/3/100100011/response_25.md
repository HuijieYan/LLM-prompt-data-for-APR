### Analysis:
1. The `_recache` function is responsible for resetting marker properties in the `markers.py` file.
2. The bug seems to be related to the `_filled` attribute not taking into account the 'none' fillstyle correctly.
3. The failing test `test_marker_fillstyle` checks if the markers with fillstyle 'none' are correctly identified as not filled, which is failing.
4. To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the `_filled` attribute respects the 'none' fillstyle when creating MarkerStyle objects.
   
### Bug Explanation:
The bug occurs because the `_filled` attribute is set to `True` unconditionally in the `_recache` function, which conflicts with the intention of setting a filled marker to 'none'. This leads to the markers not being hollow as expected when creating a MarkerStyle object with fillstyle set to 'none'.

### Bug Fix:
To fix the bug, we need to update the `_recache` function to properly handle the 'none' fillstyle by setting the `_filled` attribute based on the fillstyle parameter when creating MarkerStyle objects.

### Corrected Version:
```python
# The corrected version of the buggy function
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    self._filled = self.get_fillstyle() != 'none'  # Update _filled based on fillstyle
    self._marker_function()
```

By updating the `_recache` function to consider the fillstyle when setting the `_filled` attribute, the bug should be fixed, and the MarkerStyle objects with 'none' fillstyle should now correctly represent hollow markers.
