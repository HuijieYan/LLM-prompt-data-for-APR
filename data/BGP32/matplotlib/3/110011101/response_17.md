### Analysis
The buggy function `_recache()` in the `MarkerStyle` class is supposed to update certain attributes of the `MarkerStyle` instance. However, it currently calls `self._marker_function()` without checking if it exists or is defined. This results in the failing test since `is_filled()` method expects certain attributes to be updated properly. 

### Bug Cause
The bug is caused because the `_marker_function` is called without any guarantee that it exists, leading to potential issues in updating the attributes of the `MarkerStyle` instance.

### Fix Strategy
To fix this bug, we need to check if `_marker_function` exists before calling it in the `_recache()` method. If it does not exist, we should handle this scenario appropriately.

### Corrected Code
Here is the corrected version of the `_recache()` method in the `MarkerStyle` class:

```python
class MarkerStyle():

    def _recache(self):
        if self._marker_function is None:
            return
        self._path = _empty_path
        self._transform = IdentityTransform()
        self._alt_path = None
        self._alt_transform = None
        self._snap_threshold = None
        self._joinstyle = 'round'
        self._capstyle = 'butt'
        self._filled = True
        self._marker_function()
```

By adding the `if self._marker_function is None` check before calling the function, we ensure that the `_marker_function` is executed only if it exists, preventing the error encountered in the failing test case.
