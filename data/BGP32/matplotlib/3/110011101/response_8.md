### Analysis
1. The `_recache` function in the `MarkerStyle` class is not properly setting the value of `self._filled` based on the `marker_function`. This is causing the failing test as it checks whether the marker is filled or not.
2. The issue lies in the line: `self._filled = True` and it should be set based on the logic of the `marker_function`.
   
### Bug Cause
The bug is caused by setting `self._filled` to `True` unconditionally in the `_recache` function, which doesn't reflect the actual state of the marker. This leads to incorrect behavior when checking if the marker is filled or not.

### Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to update the `_recache` function to properly set the value of `self._filled` based on the logic of the `marker_function`. This way, the expected behavior related to marker fillstyle can be achieved.

### Corrected Version
```python
class MarkerStyle():
    def _recache(self):
        if self._marker_function is None:
            return
        self._path = _empty_path
        self._transform = IdentityTransform()
        self._alt_path = None
        self._alt_transform = None
        self._snap_threshold = None
        self._joinstyle = 'round'
        self._capstyle = 'butt'
        self._filled = self._marker_function() == 'filled'
``` 

In the corrected version, `self._filled` is set based on the return value of `self._marker_function()`. It checks if the marker is filled or not and assigns the corresponding boolean value to `self._filled`. This way, the `is_filled` method will return the correct result based on the marker's actual fillstyle.
