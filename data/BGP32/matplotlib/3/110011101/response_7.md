### Analysis
The `_recache` function in the `MarkerStyle` class is setting `_filled` to `True` unconditionally, which is causing the test `assert not marker_style.is_filled()` to fail. The expected behavior is for `_filled` to reflect the fillstyle value provided when creating the `MarkerStyle` instance.

### Bug Cause
The bug is caused by not updating the `_filled` variable based on the provided `fillstyle` value.

### Bug Fix
To fix the bug, we need to adjust the `_recache` function to set `_filled` based on the `fillstyle` value provided when creating the `MarkerStyle` instance.

### Corrected Version
```python
class MarkerStyle():
    def _recache(self):
        if self._marker_function is None:
            return
        self._path = _empty_path
        self._transform = IdentityTransform()
        self._alt_path = None
        self._alt_transform = None
        self._snap_threshold = None
        self._joinstyle = 'round'
        self._capstyle = 'butt'
        self._filled = self._fillstyle != 'none'
        self._marker_function()
``` 

By updating the `_filled` variable based on the `fillstyle` value, the corrected version of the `_recache` function should now pass the failing test and behave as expected.
