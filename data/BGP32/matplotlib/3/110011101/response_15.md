### Analysis
1. The function `_recache` is designed to recache certain attributes based on the current state of the marker style.
2. The failing test indicates that the `is_filled` method is returning the opposite of what is expected. This suggests that the `_filled` attribute is not being set correctly in the `_recache` function.
3. The function sets `_filled` to True by default, but it should be set to False if the `fillstyle` is `'none'`.
4. To fix the bug, we need to check the `fillstyle` attribute and update the `_filled` attribute accordingly.

### Bug Fix
```python
class MarkerStyle():
    def _recache(self):
        if self._marker_function is None:
            return
        self._path = _empty_path
        self._transform = IdentityTransform()
        self._alt_path = None
        self._alt_transform = None
        self._snap_threshold = None
        self._joinstyle = 'round'
        self._capstyle = 'butt'
        self._filled = True
        if self._fillstyle == 'none':
            self._filled = False
        self._marker_function()
```

By adding a conditional statement to set `_filled` to False when `fillstyle` is `'none'`, we ensure that the `_filled` attribute reflects the desired state based on the input. This modification should address the bug and make the function behave as expected.
