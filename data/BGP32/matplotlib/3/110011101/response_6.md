The bug in the provided function `_recache` is that it is not correctly updating the `_filled` attribute based on the `_fillstyle` attribute. The expected behavior is that if the `fillstyle` is set to `'none'`, then `_filled` should be set to `False`.

### Cause of the Bug
The bug is causing the failing test because the `is_filled` method of the `MarkerStyle` class is returning `True` when it should return `False` based on the `fillstyle='none'` input. This is due to the fact that the `_filled` attribute is not updated correctly when the `_recache` function is called.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug
To fix the bug, we need to update the `_filled` attribute based on the `_fillstyle`. If the `_fillstyle` is set to `'none'`, then `_filled` should be set to `False`.

### Corrected Version of the Function
```python
class MarkerStyle():
    def _recache(self):
        if self._marker_function is None:
            return
        self._path = _empty_path
        self._transform = IdentityTransform()
        self._alt_path = None
        self._alt_transform = None
        self._snap_threshold = None
        self._joinstyle = 'round'
        self._capstyle = 'butt'
        self._filled = self._fillstyle != 'none'  # Update _filled based on _fillstyle
        self._marker_function()
```

By updating the `_filled` attribute based on the `_fillstyle` input parameter, the corrected function should now pass the failing test and have the expected behavior.
