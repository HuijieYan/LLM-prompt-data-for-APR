The bug in the `_recache` function is that it sets `self._filled = True` regardless of the fillstyle specified. This leads to the failing test as it expects `marker_style.is_filled()` to return `False` when fillstyle is set to `'none'`.

To fix this bug, we need to update the `_recache` function to take into account the fillstyle specified and adjust the `_filled` attribute accordingly.

Here is the corrected version of the `_recache` function:

```python
class MarkerStyle():
    
    def _recache(self):
        if self._marker_function is None:
            return
        
        self._path = _empty_path
        self._transform = IdentityTransform()
        self._alt_path = None
        self._alt_transform = None
        self._snap_threshold = None
        self._joinstyle = 'round'
        self._capstyle = 'butt'
        
        # Set _filled based on fillstyle
        self._filled = self._fillstyle.lower() != 'none'
        
        self._marker_function()
```

By updating the `_recache` function to consider the fillstyle when setting the `_filled` attribute, we ensure the correct behavior based on the fillstyle specified. This change should now make the failing test pass.
