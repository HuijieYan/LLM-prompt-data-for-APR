### Analysis:
- The buggy function `_recache` is not correctly updating the `_filled` attribute based on the return value of `_marker_function`.
- The error message is related to the assertion that `marker_style.is_filled()` should return `False`, but it is currently returning `True`.
- The runtime values show that `_filled` is set to `True`, which contradicts the expected value in the failing test.

### Bug:
The bug is in the assignment of the `_filled` attribute. It is always being set to `True` regardless of the return value of `_marker_function`.

### Fix:
Modify the `_recache` function so that it updates the `_filled` attribute based on the return value of `_marker_function`.

### Corrected Version:
```python
class MarkerStyle():
    def _recache(self):
        if self._marker_function is None:
            return
        self._path = _empty_path
        self._transform = IdentityTransform()
        self._alt_path = None
        self._alt_transform = None
        self._snap_threshold = None
        self._joinstyle = 'round'
        self._capstyle = 'butt'
        self._filled = self._marker_function()
``` 

By assigning the return value of `_marker_function` to `_filled`, the corrected version ensures that the `_filled` attribute reflects the actual filled status based on the marker function.
