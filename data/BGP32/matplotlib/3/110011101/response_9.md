### Analysis
1. The `_recache` function in the `MarkerStyle` class is intended to reset several attributes to their default values, and then call the `_marker_function` if it is not `None`.
2. The failing test indicates that the `is_filled()` method is not returning the correct result, which suggests that the `_filled` attribute is not being properly reset to `False` within the `_recache` function.

### Bug Explanation
The bug is likely in the way the `_filled` attribute is being reset within the `_recache` function. The failing test expects `_filled` to be `False` after the function call, but it remains `True`. This discrepancy causes the failure in the test assertion.

### Bug Fix
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the `_filled` attribute is correctly set to `False` during the `_recache` function call. We should update the function to assign `False` to `_filled` instead of `True`. 

### Corrected Code
```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: lib/matplotlib/markers.py

# The declaration of the class containing the buggy function
class MarkerStyle():
    
    # The corrected version of the _recache function
    def _recache(self):
        if self._marker_function is None:
            return
        self._path = _empty_path
        self._transform = IdentityTransform()
        self._alt_path = None
        self._alt_transform = None
        self._snap_threshold = None
        self._joinstyle = 'round'
        self._capstyle = 'butt'
        self._filled = False
        self._marker_function()
``` 

By setting `_filled = False` in the `_recache` function, we ensure that the `_filled` attribute is correctly reset to `False` as expected by the failing test. This correction should now pass the failing test case.
