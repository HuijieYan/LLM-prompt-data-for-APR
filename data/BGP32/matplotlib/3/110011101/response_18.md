### Analysis
1. The `_recache` method in the `MarkerStyle` class is responsible for reinitializing certain attributes of the class. In the buggy function, there is a call to `self._marker_function()` which should be updating the `self._filled` attribute. However, in the failing test, it is observed that `assert not marker_style.is_filled()` fails, indicating that the `self._filled` attribute is not being updated correctly.
   
2. The buggy function doesn't update the `self._filled` attribute based on the `_marker_function`.

### Bug Cause
The `self._filled` attribute is not correctly updated by the `_marker_function` method, leading to incorrect behavior in the tests.

### Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the `self._filled` attribute is being updated correctly by the `_marker_function`.

### Corrected Version

```python
class MarkerStyle():
    def _recache(self):
        if self._marker_function is None:
            return
        self._path = _empty_path
        self._transform = IdentityTransform()
        self._alt_path = None
        self._alt_transform = None
        self._snap_threshold = None
        self._joinstyle = 'round'
        self._capstyle = 'butt'
        self._filled = True
        self._marker_function()
        if self._marker_function.__name__ == 'set_filled':
            self._filled = self._marker_function()
``` 

By checking the `_marker_function` name and updating `self._filled` accordingly, we can ensure that the attribute gets updated correctly. This should resolve the issue observed in the failing test.
