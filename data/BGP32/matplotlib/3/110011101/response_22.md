### Analysis
1. The `_recache` function in the `MarkerStyle` class is not properly handling the case where `self._marker_function` is not None. It returns early without updating the `_filled` variable, leading to the incorrect behavior observed in the failing test.
   
2. The buggy function sets various attributes of the `MarkerStyle` instance without updating the `_filled` attribute when the `_marker_function` is not None.

### Bug Cause
The bug arises from the early return in the `_recache` function without updating the `_filled` attribute when `_marker_function` is not None. This leads to incorrect behavior when the `is_filled` method is called, as it expects `_filled` to be updated properly.

### Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the `_filled` attribute is updated correctly in all cases within the `_recache` function, not just when the `_marker_function` is None. We should update `_filled` based on the conditions in the function.

### Corrected Version
```python
class MarkerStyle():
    
    def _recache(self):
        if self._marker_function is None:
            return
        self._path = _empty_path
        self._transform = IdentityTransform()
        self._alt_path = None
        self._alt_transform = None
        self._snap_threshold = None
        self._joinstyle = 'round'
        self._capstyle = 'butt'
        self._filled = self._fillstyle != 'none'  # Update _filled based on _fillstyle value
        self._marker_function()
``` 

By updating the `_filled` attribute based on the `_fillstyle` value, we ensure that it reflects the correct fill state of the marker style. This correction should address the issue observed in the failing test.
