### Analysis
1. The `MarkerStyle` class contains a `_recache` method that resets various attributes of the class.
2. The error occurs when the `is_filled` method is called after the `_recache` method, which sets `_filled` to `True`.
3. The `is_filled` method is expecting `_filled` to be `False`, as indicated in the failing test.
4. The bug is caused by the `_recache` method setting `_filled` to `True` unconditionally.
5. To fix the bug, we need to update the `_recache` method to take into account the `fillstyle` parameter and set `_filled` accordingly.

### Bug Fix
```python
class MarkerStyle():
    def _recache(self):
        if self._marker_function is None:
            return

        if self._fillstyle == 'none':
            self._filled = False
        else:
            self._filled = True

        self._path = _empty_path
        self._transform = IdentityTransform()
        self._alt_path = None
        self._alt_transform = None
        self._snap_threshold = None
        self._joinstyle = 'round'
        self._capstyle = 'butt'
        self._marker_function()
``` 

By updating the `_recache` method to set `_filled` based on the `fillstyle` parameter, we ensure that the `is_filled` method behaves correctly according to the expectations of the tests.
