### Analysis:

1. The buggy function `_recache` is responsible for setting various attributes of a marker in matplotlib.
2. The GitHub issue mentions a problem where setting `fillstyle='none'` does not make the marker hollow as expected.
3. The cause of the bug could be that the `_filled` attribute is set to `True` by default in the `_recache` function, which overrides the `fillstyle='none'` setting when creating a custom marker style.
4. To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the `_filled` attribute corresponds to the `fillstyle` setting in the MarkerStyle.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
Since the issue is related to markers not being hollow when setting `fillstyle='none'`, we need to make sure that the `_filled` attribute reflects the `fillstyle` setting in the MarkerStyle. If `fillstyle` is set to `'none'`, `_filled` should be set to `False`.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    
    if self._fillstyle == 'none':
        self._filled = False
    else:
        self._filled = True
        
    self._marker_function()
```

By checking the `fillstyle` setting and adjusting the `_filled` attribute accordingly, the corrected version should now honor the desired behavior of making markers hollow when `fillstyle='none'`.
