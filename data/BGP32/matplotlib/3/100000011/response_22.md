### Analysis:
The `_recache` function sets various attributes to default values and calls the `_marker_function`. However, in the GitHub issue provided, the user wants to create hollow markers by setting the `fillstyle` parameter of the `MarkerStyle` object to `'none'`, but the markers are not being rendered as hollow. This indicates a potential issue within the `_recache` function that may be causing the markers to be filled instead of hollow.

### Potential Error Locations:
The issue could potentially be related to the `_filled` attribute being set to `True` in the `_recache` function. This may be overriding the fillstyle set by the user.

### Cause of the Bug:
The bug is likely caused by the default value of `_filled` being set to `True` in the `_recache` function, which results in the markers being filled even when the user sets the `fillstyle` to `'none'`.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the `_filled` attribute is set based on the `fillstyle` parameter provided by the user in the `MarkerStyle` object.

### Corrected Version:
Here is the corrected version of the `_recache` function that takes into account the user-defined `fillstyle` parameter:

```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    self._filled = (self._fillstyle != 'none')  # Set filled based on fillstyle
    self._marker_function()
```

With this correction, the `MarkerStyle` object will properly render hollow markers when the `fillstyle` is set to `'none'`.
