### Analysis:
The buggy function `_recache` is responsible for setting up the marker properties in matplotlib. Based on the GitHub issue, the problem arises when trying to create hollow markers by setting the `fillstyle` to `'none'` using a custom `MarkerStyle`. This indicates that the bug might be related to how the `fillstyle` is handled within the `_recache` function.

### Error Location:
The issue likely stems from the `_filled` attribute being set to `True` in the `_recache` function, which might be overriding the attempt to create hollow markers.

### Bug Cause:
The bug occurs because the `_recache` function always sets `_filled` to `True`, which conflicts with the intention of creating hollow markers by setting `fillstyle='none'`.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the `_filled` attribute of the marker is set correctly according to the `fillstyle` parameter in the marker style. If `fillstyle` is set to `'none'`, then `_filled` should be set to `False` to create hollow markers.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    self._filled = self.get_fillstyle() != 'none'  # Update _filled based on fillstyle
    self._marker_function()
```

By modifying the `_recache` function to check the `fillstyle` and set `_filled` accordingly, the bug should be resolved, and the markers should display as hollow when using `fillstyle='none'`.
