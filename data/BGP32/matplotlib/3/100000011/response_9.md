### Analysis:
The buggy function `_recache` is responsible for reinitializing the marker properties whenever needed. In this case, the `_marker_function` is called, which should update the marker properties accordingly. The issue reported on GitHub indicates that setting the `fillstyle='none'` does not result in hollow markers as expected.

### Identified Error:
The issue likely stems from the `_recache` function not handling the `fillstyle='none'` properly, resulting in the markers not being hollow. This could be due to the function not correctly applying the desired fillstyle.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is likely caused by not properly updating the marker properties based on the specified `fillstyle`.

### Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the `_recache` function properly handles the `fillstyle` parameter and updates the properties accordingly to create hollow markers.

### Corrected Version:

```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    if self.get_fillstyle() == 'none': # Check if fillstyle is set to 'none'
        self._filled = False  # Set filled to False for hollow markers
    else:
        self._filled = True
    self._marker_function()
```

In the corrected version, we added a check to see if the `fillstyle` is set to `'none'`. If it is, we set `_filled` to `False` to create hollow markers. Otherwise, it remains `True`. This change should address the issue reported on GitHub where the markers were not hollow when `fillstyle='none'` was used.
