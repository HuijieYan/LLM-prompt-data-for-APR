### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_recache` is responsible for reinitializing the marker properties in the `markers.py` file of the `matplotlib` library.
2. The issue reported on GitHub suggests that setting the `fillstyle='none'` for markers does not make them hollow as expected.
3. The bug occurs because the `_filled` attribute in the `_recache` function is set to `True` by default, which overrides the `fillstyle='none'` setting.
4. To fix the bug, the `_filled` attribute needs to be controlled by the `fillstyle` parameter.
5. A corrected version of the function should check the `fillstyle` parameter, and set `_filled` accordingly.


### Fixing the Bug:

```python
# The corrected version of the function
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt
    # Check if fillstyle is set to 'none' to make markers hollow
    if self._fillstyle == 'none':  
        self._filled = False
    else:
        self._filled = True
    self._marker_function()
```

By updating the `_recache` function to check the `fillstyle` attribute and set `_filled` accordingly, the bug related to markers not being hollow when using `fillstyle='none'` should be resolved.
