### Analysis:
The buggy function `_recache` is responsible for resetting the marker properties, including the `_filled` attribute, which controls whether the marker is filled or hollow. The GitHub issue complains about markers not being hollow even when setting the `fillstyle` parameter to `'none'`.

### Error Location:
The issue might arise from the `_filled` attribute being set to `True` unconditionally in the `_recache` function. This could override the desired behavior of having hollow markers.

### Cause of the Bug:
The bug is caused by the `_filled` attribute being set to `True` in the `_recache` function of the `markers.py` file. This default setting conflicts with the intention of creating hollow markers when the `fillstyle` parameter is set to `'none'`.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to update the `_recache` function to respect the `fillstyle` parameter. If the `fillstyle` is set to `'none'`, we should adjust the `_filled` attribute accordingly to make the markers hollow.

### Corrected Version:
```python
# The corrected version of the buggy function
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    self._filled = 'face' not in self.get_fillstyle()
    self._marker_function()
```

In the corrected version, the `_filled` attribute is updated based on the presence of `'face'` in the `fillstyle`. This change ensures that markers will be hollow when the `fillstyle` is set to `'none'`.

By making this adjustment, the issue reported on GitHub where markers are not hollow when setting `fillstyle` to `'none'` should be resolved.
