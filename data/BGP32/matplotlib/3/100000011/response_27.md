### Analysis:
The buggy function `_recache` is responsible for resetting marker properties. The issue reported on GitHub indicates that setting `fillstyle='none'` does not result in hollow markers as expected.

### Potential Error Locations:
The bug could be related to how the `_filled` property is being set in the `_recache` function. Since it is always set to `True` regardless of the `fillstyle` parameter, this could be the cause of the issue.

### Cause of the Bug:
The `_filled` property is always being set to `True` in the `_recache` function, which overrides the intended behavior when setting `fillstyle='none'`.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, the `_filled` property should be updated based on the `fillstyle` parameter passed to the `MarkerStyle`.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    self._filled = self.get_fillstyle() != 'none'
    self._marker_function()
```

In the corrected version, the `_filled` property is set based on the `fillstyle` parameter of the `MarkerStyle` object. This change ensures that markers will be hollow when `fillstyle='none'` is used.
