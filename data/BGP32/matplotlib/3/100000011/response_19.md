### Analysis:
The buggy function `_recache` is responsible for resetting various properties of markers in matplotlib. The GitHub issue complains that when setting `fillstyle='none'` using a custom `markers.MarkerStyle`, the markers are not hollow as expected.

### Error locations:
1. The `_filled` property in the `_recache` function is initially set to True, causing the markers to be filled even when `fillstyle='none'` is specified.

### Bug cause:
The bug is caused by the `_filled` property being set to True by default in the `_recache` function, which overrides the desired effect of making the markers hollow when `fillstyle='none'` is used in the custom `markers.MarkerStyle`.

### Strategy for fixing the bug:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the `_filled` property is set to `False` when `fillstyle='none'` is specified in the custom `markers.MarkerStyle`.

### Corrected version of the function:
```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    self._filled = (self._filled and self.get_fillstyle() != 'none')  # Check fillstyle before setting _filled
    self._marker_function()
``` 

In the corrected version, we update the `_filled` property based on the `fillstyle` specified in the custom `markers.MarkerStyle`. This change ensures that the markers are correctly displayed as hollow when `fillstyle='none'` is used.
