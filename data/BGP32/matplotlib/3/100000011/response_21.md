1. Analyzing the buggy function and its relationship with the GitHub issue:
   - The buggy function `_recache` is responsible for re-initializing marker attributes in matplotlib markers. In the context of the GitHub issue, the user is trying to create a hollow marker by setting `fillstyle='none'`, but the hollow effect is not being achieved.
   
2. Potential error locations within the buggy function:
   - The issue might be related to the setting of the `_filled` attribute to `True` by default in the `_recache` function.

3. Cause of the bug:
   - The bug could be caused by the `_filled` attribute being set to `True` in the `_recache` function, as it overrides the `fillstyle='none'` setting made by the user, resulting in filled markers instead of hollow ones.

4. Strategy for fixing the bug:
   - Update the `_recache` function to consider the `fillstyle` setting provided by the user, so that it reflects accurately in the marker appearance.
   
5. Corrected version of the function:
```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    self._filled = 'none' if self.get_fillstyle() == 'none' else True
    self._marker_function()
```

By updating the `_recache` function to consider the `fillstyle` setting provided by the user, we check if `fillstyle` is set to `'none'` and update the `_filled` attribute accordingly. This change should address the issue reported by the user on GitHub about markers not being hollow when `fillstyle='none'` is used.
