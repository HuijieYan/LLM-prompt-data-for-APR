### Analysis:
The issue reported on GitHub indicates that the markers are not hollow when the user sets `fillstyle='none'` for a customized MarkerStyle while using `ax.scatter()` in matplotlib. This behavior suggests a bug in the `_recache()` function of the `markers.py` file, which may be preventing the correct rendering of hollow markers.

### Error Locations:
1. The `_filled` attribute is explicitly set to `True` in the `_recache()` function, which contradicts the intention of making markers hollow.
2. The `_marker_function()` is called at the end of the function, which may be responsible for setting the markers as filled.

### Cause of the Bug:
The bug in the `_recache()` function is causing the markers to be filled even when `fillstyle='none'` is used. By setting `_filled` to `True` and calling `_marker_function()`, the markers end up being filled regardless of the specified styling.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
1. Update the `_recache()` function to consider the `fillstyle` attribute of the MarkerStyle object.
2. Ensure that markers are rendered correctly based on the fillstyle specified by the user.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    self._filled = self.get_fillstyle() != 'none'
    self._marker_function()
```

In the corrected version, the `_filled` attribute is updated based on the fillstyle provided in the MarkerStyle object. This modification ensures that the markers are rendered correctly as hollow when `fillstyle='none'` is specified by the user.
