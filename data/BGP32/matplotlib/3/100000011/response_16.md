## Analysis:
The buggy function `_recache` in the `markers.py` file of `lib/matplotlib` is responsible for reinitializing certain attributes related to markers in a plot. The issue reported on GitHub mentions that when trying to set markers as hollow by using `fillstyle='none'`, the desired outcome is not achieved. This indicates that there might be an issue with how the `_recache` function handles the `fillstyle` parameter.

## Error Location:
The bug seems to be related to the `_filled` attribute not being properly updated based on the `fillstyle` parameter when re-caching the marker properties in the `_recache` function.

## Bug Cause:
The `_recache` function in the buggy code snippet does not update the `_filled` attribute based on the `fillstyle` parameter, leading to markers not becoming hollow as expected.

## Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to modify the `_recache` function to properly update the `_filled` attribute based on the `fillstyle` parameter provided in the marker style.

## Corrected Version:
```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    self._filled = self.get_fillstyle() != 'none'  # Update _filled based on fillstyle
    self._marker_function()
```

By updating the `_filled` attribute based on the `fillstyle` parameter, the corrected version of the `_recache` function should properly handle setting markers as hollow when using markers with `fillstyle='none'`. This fix should address the issue reported on GitHub.
