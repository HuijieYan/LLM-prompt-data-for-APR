### Analysis:
The GitHub issue describes that when using `ax.scatter()` and setting `markers.MarkerStyle()`'s `fillstyle` to `'none'`, the markers are not hollow as expected. The buggy function `_recache()` in `markers.py` is responsible for updating marker properties, including the fill style. However, the fill style is not being handled correctly in the current implementation.

### Potential Error Locations:
The issue could be related to the incorrect handling of the filled property within the `_recache()` function. Specifically, setting `_filled = True` may be causing the markers to be filled even when `fillstyle='none'` is specified.

### Cause of the Bug:
The bug is caused by the hardcoded `_filled = True` assignment in the `_recache()` function. This setting overrides any attempt to set the fill style to `'none'`, resulting in the markers being filled instead of hollow.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the fill style specified in `markers.MarkerStyle()` is correctly respected when updating the marker properties in the `_recache()` function. Specifically, we should modify the `_filled` property based on the `fillstyle` parameter provided in the `MarkerStyle`.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    
    # Update filled property based on fillstyle
    if self.get_fillstyle() == 'none':
        self._filled = False
    else:
        self._filled = True
    
    self._marker_function()
```

By updating the `_recache()` function to set `_filled` based on the `fillstyle` specified in `markers.MarkerStyle()`, we can ensure that the markers will be hollow when `fillstyle='none'` is used as intended.
