### Analysis:
The provided buggy function `_recache` is responsible for reinitializing certain attributes when called. The issue reported on GitHub indicates that when using `ax.scatter()` with a custom MarkerStyle and setting `fillstyle='none'`, the markers are not hollow as expected. 

### Potential Error Locations:
The issue reported on GitHub suggests that the markers are not hollow when the `fillstyle` parameter is set to `'none'`. The `fillstyle` parameter is related to the `_filled` attribute in the buggy function. There might be an issue with how the `_filled` attribute is handled within the `_recache` function.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is likely caused by the assignment of `self._filled = True` in the `_recache` function. This initialization causes the markers to be filled even when `fillstyle='none'` is set in the custom MarkerStyle.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, the initialization of `self._filled` should be modified based on the `fillstyle` value in the custom MarkerStyle provided during the call to `ax.scatter()`.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    self._filled = self._fillstyle != 'none'  # Check if fillstyle is 'none'
    self._marker_function()
```

By making the change above, the corrected version of the `_recache` function will correctly set the `_filled` attribute based on the `fillstyle` provided, ensuring that markers can be hollow when desired.
