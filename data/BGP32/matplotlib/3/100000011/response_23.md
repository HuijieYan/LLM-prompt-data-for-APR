**Analysis:**

The buggy function `_recache` is responsible for resetting marker properties, including filling the marker shape with color. The GitHub issue mentions that setting `fillstyle='none'` does not make the markers hollow as intended. This implies that the `_recache` function might be overriding the `fillstyle` property set by the user.

**Potential error location:**

The issue might be with the `_filled` property being set to `True` unconditionally in the `_recache` function. This could be preventing the markers from appearing hollow when `fillstyle='none'`.

**Cause of the bug:**

The `_filled` property being set to `True` by default in the `_recache` function overrides the `fillstyle` property set by the user, resulting in filled markers instead of hollow ones.

**Strategy for fixing the bug:**

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the `fillstyle` set by the user is respected. This can be achieved by updating the `_filled` property based on the `fillstyle` value provided by the user.

**Corrected version:**

Here is the corrected version of the `_recache` function with the bug fixed:

```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    self._filled = self._fillstyle != 'none'  # Update _filled based on fillstyle
    self._marker_function()
```

By updating the `_filled` property based on the `fillstyle` value provided by the user, the markers will now appear hollow when `fillstyle='none'`.
