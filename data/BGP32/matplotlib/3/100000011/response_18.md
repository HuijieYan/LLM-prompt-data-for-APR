### Analysis:
The issue reported on GitHub indicates that the markers are not displayed as hollow when setting `fillstyle='none'` in a custom `markers.MarkerStyle`. This behavior is contrary to the expected outcome, which should result in hollow markers. The provided buggy function `_recache` is related to marker caching and transformation, which might be affecting how the markers are rendered.

### Potential Error Locations:
1. The `_filled` attribute is set to `True` in the `_recache` function, which might be causing the markers to be filled instead of hollow.
2. The `_marker_function` is called, but it's not clear what it does or how it might affect marker appearance.

### Cause of the Bug:
The bug seems to be caused by the `_filled` attribute being set to `True`, which results in the markers being filled despite setting `fillstyle='none'`. This inconsistency likely leads to the markers not appearing as hollow as intended by the user.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, the `_filled` attribute needs to be set to `False` when the `fillstyle` is set to `'none'`. Additionally, any further processing in `_marker_function` should consider the `fillstyle` parameter to correctly render the markers.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    self._filled = self._fillstyle != 'none'
    self._marker_function()
```

By setting `_filled` based on the `fillstyle` parameter, the corrected version ensures that the markers will be rendered as hollow when `fillstyle='none'` is specified, addressing the issue reported on GitHub related to the markers not appearing as expected.
