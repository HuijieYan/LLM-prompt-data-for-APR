### Analysis:
The buggy function `_recache` in `lib/matplotlib/markers.py` is responsible for initializing marker properties. The GitHub issue reports that setting `fillstyle='none'` in a custom `MarkerStyle` object does not result in hollow markers as expected.

### Potential error locations:
The issue may be related to the `_filled` property being set to `True` unconditionally in the `_recache` function. This is likely causing the markers to be filled regardless of the `fillstyle` parameter.

### Cause of the bug:
The bug occurs because the `_filled` property is always set to `True` in the `_recache` function, overriding the `fillstyle='none'` setting.

### Strategy for fixing the bug:
To fix the bug, we need to update the `_filled` property based on the `fillstyle` parameter provided in the `MarkerStyle` object.

### Corrected version:

```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    
    # Check fillstyle to determine if marker should be filled
    if self.get_fillstyle() == 'none':
        self._filled = False
    else:
        self._filled = True
    
    self._marker_function()
```

In the corrected version, we added a condition to check the `fillstyle` of the `MarkerStyle` object. If `fillstyle` is set to `'none'`, we set `_filled` to `False` to make the marker hollow. Otherwise, `_filled` remains `True` for filled markers. This change should resolve the issue reported on GitHub related to hollow markers not being displayed when using `fillstyle='none'`.
