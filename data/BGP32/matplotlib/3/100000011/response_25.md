## Analysis:
The buggy function `_recache` in the `markers.py` file is responsible for re-initializing the attributes of a MarkerStyle object. However, the issue reported on GitHub indicates that setting the `fillstyle` parameter to 'none' when creating a custom MarkerStyle is not resulting in hollow markers as expected. This implies that the `_recache` function may not correctly handle the 'fillstyle' parameter.

## Potential Error Location:
The bug might be related to how the `_recache` function sets the `filled` attribute of the MarkerStyle object to `True` unconditionally.

## Cause of the Bug:
The bug is likely caused by the `_recache` function resetting the `filled` attribute to `True` regardless of the value of the `fillstyle` parameter specified when creating the MarkerStyle object. This leads to the markers not appearing hollow even when 'fillstyle' is set to 'none'.

## Suggested Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to modify the `_recache` function to ensure that the `filled` attribute is set based on the `fillstyle` parameter provided during the MarkerStyle object creation. If the `fillstyle` is 'none', then the `filled` attribute should be set to `False` to create hollow markers.

## Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    self._filled = self.get_fillstyle() != 'none'
    self._marker_function()
```

In the corrected version of the function, we check the `fillstyle` parameter of the MarkerStyle object and set the `filled` attribute accordingly. If the `fillstyle` is 'none', then `filled` is set to `False` to produce hollow markers.

By making this change, the issue reported on GitHub should be resolved, and the markers created with a custom MarkerStyle having 'fillstyle' set to 'none' should appear hollow when used with `ax.scatter()`.
