### Analysis:
From the provided buggy function and GitHub issue, it seems that the issue is related to setting markers to be hollow by using `fillstyle='none'` in a customized `MarkerStyle` object. The bug may be occurring due to the `_filled` attribute being set to `True` in the `_recache` function of the `MarkerStyle` class.

### Error Location:
The error is likely caused by the line `self._filled = True` in the `_recache` function of the `MarkerStyle` class. Setting `_filled` to `True` would contradict the intention of making the markers hollow using `fillstyle='none'`.

### Bug Cause:
The bug causes the markers to appear filled even when the `fillstyle='none'` parameter is used in the `MarkerStyle`, as the `_filled` attribute is set to `True` by default.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to update the `_recache` function in the `MarkerStyle` class to correctly handle the `fillstyle='none'` parameter by setting the `_filled` attribute to `False` when `fillstyle` is `'none'`.

### Corrected Version:
```python
# The corrected version of the _recache function
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    self._filled = False if self._fillstyle == 'none' else True
    self._marker_function()
```

By updating the `_recache` function as shown above, the issue with markers not appearing hollow when using `fillstyle='none'` should be resolved.
