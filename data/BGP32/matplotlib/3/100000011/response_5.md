### Analysis:
The GitHub issue reports a problem when trying to set markers to be hollow using `markers.MarkerStyle` with the `fillstyle='none'` parameter. The buggy function `_recache` is related to the creation and initialization of markers in Matplotlib. The incorrect behavior could be due to not properly setting the fillstyle to 'none' in the `MarkerStyle`.

### Identified Potential Error:
The bug may be related to the `_filled` attribute being set to `True` in the `_recache` function, which could conflict with the attempt to create hollow markers by setting `fillstyle='none'`.

### Cause of the Bug:
The `_filled` attribute is set to `True` by default in the `_recache` function. This conflicts with the intention of creating hollow markers when using `fillstyle='none'` in the `MarkerStyle`, leading to the markers not being hollow as expected.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the `_filled` attribute is set to `False` when the `fillstyle` parameter in `MarkerStyle` is set to 'none'. This will allow the markers to be hollowed out as intended.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: lib/matplotlib/markers.py

def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    if self._fillstyle == 'none':
        self._filled = False
    else:
        self._filled = True
    self._marker_function()
```

This corrected version of the `_recache` function checks if the `fillstyle` parameter is set to 'none' in the `MarkerStyle` and sets the `_filled` attribute accordingly. This change should ensure that markers are hollow when `fillstyle` is set to 'none'.
