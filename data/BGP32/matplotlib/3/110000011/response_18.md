### Analysis:
- The `MarkerStyle` class in `lib/matplotlib/markers.py` contains a `_recache` method that is supposed to recache marker properties. However, based on the GitHub issue, there seems to be an issue where setting the `fillstyle` to 'none' doesn't result in hollow markers as expected.
- The `_recache` method initializes marker properties and calls the `_marker_function`, but it seems that the actual implementation of the `_marker_function` may not correctly handle the case when `fillstyle='none'`.

### Error Cause:
- The error seems to be related to how the `_marker_function` is handling the `fillstyle='none'` case. It is likely that the current implementation does not properly consider this scenario, leading to filled markers instead of hollow ones.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
- To fix the bug, we need to modify the implementation of the `_marker_function` to properly handle the case when `fillstyle='none'`. We should ensure that when `fillstyle='none'`, the markers are drawn as hollow shapes.

### Corrected Version:
```python
class MarkerStyle():

    def _recache(self):
        if self._marker_function is None:
            return
        self._path = _empty_path
        self._transform = IdentityTransform()
        self._alt_path = None
        self._alt_transform = None
        self._snap_threshold = None
        self._joinstyle = 'round'
        self._capstyle = 'butt'
        
        if self._fillstyle == 'none':
            self._filled = False
        else:
            self._filled = True

        self._marker_function()
```

In the corrected version, I added a check to set `_filled` to `False` when `fillstyle='none'`, indicating that the markers should be hollow. This modification ensures that the markers are drawn as hollow shapes when `fillstyle='none'`.
