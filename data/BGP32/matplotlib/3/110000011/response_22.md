## Analysis:
The issue reported on GitHub indicates that when setting the `fillstyle` parameter of the `MarkerStyle` to 'none', the markers are not hollow as expected. This suggests that there might be a bug in the `_recache` method of the `MarkerStyle` class, specifically in how it handles the `fillstyle` parameter.

## Error Location:
The bug is likely in the `_recache` method where it initializes the attributes of the `MarkerStyle` class. The issue could be related to how the `_filled` attribute is set to `True` regardless of the `fillstyle` parameter.

## Bug Cause:
The bug is caused by not properly handling the `fillstyle` parameter in the `_recache` method. The `_filled` attribute is always set to `True` which overrides the intention of making the markers hollow by setting `fillstyle='none'`.

## Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, the `_filled` attribute should be set based on the `fillstyle` parameter. If `fillstyle` is 'none', then `_filled` should be set to `False`. This change will ensure that when `fillstyle` is 'none', the marker is drawn as hollow.

## Corrected Version:
```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: lib/matplotlib/markers.py

# The updated class after fixing the bug
class MarkerStyle():
    
    # The corrected _recache function
    def _recache(self):
        if self._marker_function is None:
            return
        self._path = _empty_path
        self._transform = IdentityTransform()
        self._alt_path = None
        self._alt_transform = None
        self._snap_threshold = None
        self._joinstyle = 'round'
        self._capstyle = 'butt'
        self._filled = self._fillstyle != 'none'  # Set filled based on fillstyle
        self._marker_function()
```

By updating the `_filled` attribute based on the `fillstyle` parameter, the corrected version of the `_recache` function will ensure that markers are drawn as hollow when `fillstyle='none'` is specified.
