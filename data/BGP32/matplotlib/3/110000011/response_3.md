## Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_recache` in the `MarkerStyle` class is not correctly handling the case where `_marker_function` is `None`.
2. The issue reported on GitHub suggests that setting `fillstyle='none'` for markers is not resulting in hollow markers as expected, indicating a potential problem with marker styling.

## Potential Error Locations:
1. The check for `_marker_function` being `None` before calling it.
2. Setting `self._filled = True` might be conflicting with the intention of `fillstyle='none'`.

## Cause of the Bug:
The bug is caused by the `_recache` function not handling the case where there is no `_marker_function` specified, leading to unexpected marker behavior when `fillstyle='none'` is used.

## Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
1. Check if `_marker_function` is `None` before calling it.
2. Adjust the value of `self._filled` based on the user-provided `fillstyle` to support hollow markers.

## Corrected Version:
```python
class MarkerStyle():

    def _recache(self):
        if self._marker_function is None:
            return

        self._path = _empty_path
        self._transform = Affine2D()
        self._alt_path = None
        self._alt_transform = None
        self._snap_threshold = None
        self._joinstyle = 'round'
        self._capstyle = 'butt'
        
        if self._fillstyle == 'none':
            self._filled = False
        else:
            self._filled = True
        
        self._marker_function()
```

In the corrected version, the function first checks if `_marker_function` is `None` before proceeding with marker styling. Additionally, the `self._filled` attribute is modified based on the provided `fillstyle` to support creating hollow markers when needed.
