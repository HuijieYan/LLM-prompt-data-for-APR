### Analysis:
The buggy function `_recache` within the `MarkerStyle` class is expected to update various attributes related to the marker style. However, the bug is occurring when attempting to update the `_filled` attribute based on the provided `fillstyle`.

### Identified Error Location:
The buggy line causing the issue is:
```python
self._filled = True
```

### Cause of the Bug:
The bug is caused by setting the `_filled` attribute to `True` unconditionally in the `_recache` function, which contradicts the user's intention of using a hollow marker with `fillstyle='none'`.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
Update the `_filled` attribute based on the `fillstyle` parameter provided when creating the `MarkerStyle` instance. If the `fillstyle` is `'none'`, then `_filled` should be set to `False`.

### Corrected Version:
Here is the corrected version of the `_recache` function within the `MarkerStyle` class:

```python
class MarkerStyle():
    def _recache(self):
        if self._marker_function is None:
            return
        
        self._path = _empty_path
        self._transform = IdentityTransform()
        self._alt_path = None
        self._alt_transform = None
        self._snap_threshold = None
        self._joinstyle = 'round'
        self._capstyle = 'butt'
        self._filled = self.get_fillstyle() != 'none'
        self._marker_function()
        
    def get_fillstyle(self):
        return self._fillstyle
```

By introducing a method `get_fillstyle` to retrieve the `fillstyle` attribute and update `_filled` based on this attribute, we ensure that the correct filling behavior is applied to the marker as intended by the user.
