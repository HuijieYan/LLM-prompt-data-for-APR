### Analysis:
The bug in the `_recache` function of the `MarkerStyle` class prevents the markers from appearing as hollow when the `fillstyle` is set to 'none'. This is due to the initialization of `_filled` to `True` unconditionally within the function, which overrides the intention of setting the markers as hollow.

### Potential Error Locations:
The bug lies in the assignment of `_filled` to `True` at the end of the function, which contradicts the intended behavior of hollow markers.

### Cause of the Bug:
The bug occurs because the `_filled` attribute is set to `True` by default, even when the fillstyle is set to 'none'. This leads to the markers being filled instead of appearing as hollow as expected.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix this bug, the `_filled` attribute should be set based on the `fillstyle` parameter to reflect the desired appearance of the markers.

### Corrected Version:
```python
# The fixed version of the _recache function
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    if self._fillstyle == 'none':
        self._filled = False
    else:
        self._filled = True
    self._marker_function()
```

In this corrected version, the `_filled` attribute is set based on the `fillstyle` parameter. If the `fillstyle` is set to `'none'`, then `_filled` is set to `False` to achieve the desired hollow marker appearance.
