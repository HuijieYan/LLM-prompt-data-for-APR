### Analysis:
The buggy function `_recache` in the `MarkerStyle` class is the function responsible for updating the marker style attributes whenever needed. In the provided code snippet, there is a condition to check if the `_marker_function` is `None`. If it is `None`, the function simply returns without updating any attributes. This can be a potential issue if the `_marker_function` needs to be called to properly update the marker style.

### Identified Issue:
The issue arises from the fact that if `_marker_function` is defined but not called when it should be, the marker attributes won't be updated correctly. This leads to unexpected behavior when trying to set markers as hollow.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, the `_marker_function` should be called unconditionally to ensure that the necessary marker attributes are properly updated. This will address the issue where markers are not hollow even when `fillstyle='none'` is set.

### Corrected Version:
Below is the corrected version of the `_recache` function within the `MarkerStyle` class:

```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: lib/matplotlib/markers.py

# The declaration of the class containing the buggy function
class MarkerStyle():
    def _recache(self):
        if self._marker_function is not None:
            self._path = _empty_path
            self._transform = IdentityTransform()
            self._alt_path = None
            self._alt_transform = None
            self._snap_threshold = None
            self._joinstyle = 'round'
            self._capstyle = 'butt'
            self._filled = True
            self._marker_function()
```

By modifying the condition to `if self._marker_function is not None:`, we ensure that the `_marker_function` is always called to update the marker attributes regardless of its initial value. This fix should resolve the issue where markers are not displayed as hollow when setting `fillstyle='none'`.
