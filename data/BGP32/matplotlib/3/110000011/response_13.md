## Analysis:
The buggy function `_recache` is part of the `MarkerStyle` class in the `markers.py` file of the `matplotlib` library. The issue reported on GitHub indicates that the markers are not hollow when the `fillstyle` parameter is set to 'none'. This suggests that there might be a problem with the handling of the `fillstyle` parameter within the `_recache` function.

## Identified Error Location:
The potential error location within the buggy function is the assignment of the `_filled` attribute. The value of `_filled` is being set to `True` unconditionally, which contradicts the intention of setting markers to hollow when `fillstyle='none'`.

## Cause of the Bug:
The bug occurs because the `_filled` attribute is set to `True` regardless of the `fillstyle` value. This causes the markers to be filled even when `fillstyle='none'`.

## Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to update the `_filled` attribute based on the `fillstyle` parameter. If the `fillstyle` is 'none', we should set `_filled` to `False` to ensure that the markers are hollow.

## Corrected Version:
```python
class MarkerStyle():
    def _recache(self):
        if self._marker_function is None:
            return
        self._path = _empty_path
        self._transform = IdentityTransform()
        self._alt_path = None
        self._alt_transform = None
        self._snap_threshold = None
        self._joinstyle = 'round'
        self._capstyle = 'butt'
        self._filled = self.get_fillstyle() != 'none'
        self._marker_function()
```

In the corrected version:
1. We added a method `get_fillstyle()` to retrieve the value of the `fillstyle` parameter.
2. Based on the value of `fillstyle`, we set the `_filled` attribute. If `fillstyle='none'`, then `_filled` is set to `False`, making the markers hollow.

By making this change, the bug related to markers not being hollow when `fillstyle='none'` should be resolved.
