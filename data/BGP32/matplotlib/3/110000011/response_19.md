# The buggy function `_recache` is supposed to update the properties of MarkerStyle based on certain conditions. However, the issue reported on GitHub suggests that setting `fillstyle='none'` does not result in hollow markers as expected.

# Potential error location:
1. The `_marker_function()` call after setting default properties might be overriding the desired behavior set by the user.

# Cause of the bug:
The bug is likely caused by the `_marker_function()` call at the end of the `_recache` function. This call might be resetting the properties back to the default settings, ignoring the custom settings provided by the user.

# Strategy for fixing the bug:
To fix the bug, we should ensure that the `_marker_function()` doesn't interfere with the user-provided settings. One approach could be to move the `_marker_function()` call before the default property assignments, so that the user-provided settings are preserved.

# Corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: lib/matplotlib/markers.py

# The declaration of the class containing the corrected function
class MarkerStyle():


    # The corrected _recache function
    def _recache(self):
        if self._marker_function is None:
            return
        self._marker_function()

        self._transform = IdentityTransform()
