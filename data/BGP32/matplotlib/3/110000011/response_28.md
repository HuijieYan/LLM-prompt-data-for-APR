## Analysis:
The buggy function `_recache` within the `MarkerStyle` class is not correctly handling the case when `self._marker_function` is `None`. This leads to unexpected behavior when trying to customize the marker style.

## Error Location:
The issue lies in the conditional check for `self._marker_function` and the subsequent call to `self._marker_function()`.

## Cause of the Bug:
The bug arises from the fact that when `self._marker_function` is `None`, the function skips the reassignment of attributes such as `_path`, `_transform`, `_alt_path`, etc. This prevents the correct marker style customization specified in the GitHub issue.

## Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to modify the `_recache` function to properly handle the case when `self._marker_function` is `None`. Instead of returning immediately, we should set default values for marker attributes to ensure consistent behavior.

## Corrected Version:
```python
class MarkerStyle():
    def _recache(self):
        if self._marker_function is None:
            self._path = _empty_path
            self._transform = IdentityTransform()
            self._alt_path = None
            self._alt_transform = None
            self._snap_threshold = None
            self._joinstyle = 'round'
            self._capstyle = 'butt'
            self._filled = True
        else:
            self._path = _empty_path
            self._transform = IdentityTransform()
            self._alt_path = None
            self._alt_transform = None
            self._snap_threshold = None
            self._joinstyle = 'round'
            self._capstyle = 'butt'
            self._filled = True
            self._marker_function()
```

By making the changes as described in the corrected version of the function, we ensure that even when `self._marker_function` is `None`, the necessary attributes are correctly set to default values. This will address the issue reported in the GitHub bug by providing consistent behavior even when no custom marker function is specified.
