## Analysis:
The buggy function `_recache` in the `MarkerStyle` class is responsible for resetting certain attributes when called. The issue reported on GitHub indicates that when setting `fillstyle='none'` in a custom `MarkerStyle` object and using it with `ax.scatter()`, the markers are not hollow as expected.

## Potential Error Location:
The issue reported indicates that setting `fillstyle` to `'none'` is not working as expected. This points to a potential issue where the `_filled` attribute may not be correctly updated when `fillstyle='none'`.

## Cause of the Bug:
The bug is likely caused by the `_filled` attribute always being set to `True` in the `_recache` function, which conflicts with the intention of making the markers hollow with `fillstyle='none'`.

## Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the `_filled` attribute is correctly updated based on the `fillstyle` parameter. A possible solution would be to check the `fillstyle` parameter value and set the `_filled` attribute accordingly.

## Corrected Version:
```python
class MarkerStyle():
    def _recache(self):
        if self._marker_function is None:
            return
        self._path = _empty_path
        self._transform = IdentityTransform()
        self._alt_path = None
        self._alt_transform = None
        self._snap_threshold = None
        self._joinstyle = 'round'
        self._capstyle = 'butt'
        self._filled = self.get_fillstyle() != 'none'  # Update _filled attribute based on fillstyle
        self._marker_function()
        
    def get_fillstyle(self):
        return self._fillstyle
```

In the corrected version, the `_filled` attribute is updated based on the `fillstyle` value. A helper method `get_fillstyle` is added to retrieve the `fillstyle` value, which is then used to determine whether `_filled` should be set to `True` or `False` accordingly. This fix should address the issue reported on GitHub where markers were not hollow when `fillstyle='none'` was set.
