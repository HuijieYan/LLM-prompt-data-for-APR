### Analysis:
The buggy function `_recache()` in the `MarkerStyle` class is responsible for re-initializing certain attributes of the class. The issue reported on GitHub suggests that setting `fillstyle='none'` for markers is not producing the desired hollow markers when using `ax.scatter()`.

### Potential error locations:
- The `_marker_function` being called might not be handling the `fillstyle='none'` correctly.
- The initialization of `_filled` to `True` might be conflicting with the intention of making markers hollow.

### Cause of the bug:
The bug is likely caused by the interaction between the `fillstyle='none'` parameter and the `_filled` attribute being set to `True`. When `_filled` is set to `True`, it overrides the intention of making markers hollow even when `fillstyle='none'` is specified.

### Strategy for fixing the bug:
To fix the bug, we need to adjust the logic in the `_recache()` function to properly handle the `fillstyle='none'` parameter. This involves setting `_filled` based on the `fillstyle` parameter and ensuring that the opacity of the markers is appropriately handled when rendering them.

### Corrected version:
```python
# The corrected version of the buggy function

class MarkerStyle():
    def _recache(self):
        if self._marker_function is None:
            return
        self._path = _empty_path
        self._transform = IdentityTransform()
        self._alt_path = None
        self._alt_transform = None
        self._snap_threshold = None
        self._joinstyle = 'round'
        self._capstyle = 'butt'
        
        # Adjust the filled attribute based on fillstyle
        if self._fillstyle == 'none':
            self._filled = False
        else:
            self._filled = True
        
        self._marker_function()
```

In the corrected version, we added logic to properly handle the `fillstyle='none'` parameter by setting the `_filled` attribute to `False` when `fillstyle` is specified as `'none'`. This change should address the issue reported on GitHub and produce hollow markers when desired.
