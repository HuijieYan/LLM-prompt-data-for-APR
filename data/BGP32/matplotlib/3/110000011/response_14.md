### Analysis:
- The buggy function `_recache` in the `MarkerStyle` class is responsible for resetting various attributes to default values.
- The GitHub issue indicates that when setting `fillstyle='none'`, the markers are not hollow as expected when using `ax.scatter()`.
- The buggy function sets `_filled` to `True` unconditionally, which contradicts the intended behavior requested by the user in the GitHub issue.

### Bug Cause:
- The bug in the `_recache` function is caused by unconditionally setting `_filled` to `True`.
- This results in markers being filled even when the user specifies `fillstyle='none'`.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
- Modify the `_recache` function to check if `fillstyle` is set to `'none'`, and update the `_filled` attribute accordingly to respect the user's customization.

### Corrected Version:
```python
class MarkerStyle():
    def _recache(self):
        if self._marker_function is None:
            return
        self._path = _empty_path
        self._transform = IdentityTransform()
        self._alt_path = None
        self._alt_transform = None
        self._snap_threshold = None
        self._joinstyle = 'round'
        self._capstyle = 'butt'
        self._filled = True if self._fillstyle != 'none' else False
        self._marker_function()
```

In the corrected version, `_filled` is conditionally set to `True` or `False` based on the value of `_fillstyle`. This change ensures that markers are either filled or hollow based on the user's input.
