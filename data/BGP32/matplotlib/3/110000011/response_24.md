### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_recache` is a method within the `MarkerStyle` class.
2. The `_recache` function is responsible for resetting various attributes when called.
3. The GitHub issue highlights that the markers are not appearing as hollow when using `ax.scatter()` and setting `MarkerStyle`'s `fillstyle` to 'none'.
4. The issue may occur due to setting `fillstyle='none'` not being handled correctly within the `_recache` function.

### Bug Cause:
The bug occurs because the `_recache` method in the `MarkerStyle` class is not properly handling the `fillstyle` attribute. This leads to the markers not appearing as hollow when `fillstyle='none'` is set in the `MarkerStyle`.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the `fillstyle` attribute is properly handled in the `_recache` method. This involves checking the value of `fillstyle` and adjusting the `_filled` attribute accordingly to control whether the markers are filled or not.

### Corrected Version:
```python
class MarkerStyle():
    def _recache(self):
        if self._marker_function is None:
            return
        self._path = _empty_path
        self._transform = IdentityTransform()
        self._alt_path = None
        self._alt_transform = None
        self._snap_threshold = None
        self._joinstyle = 'round'
        self._capstyle = 'butt'
        if self.get_fillstyle() == 'none':
            self._filled = False
        else:
            self._filled = True
        self._marker_function()
```

In the corrected version, we added a condition to check if the `fillstyle` is set to `'none'`. If so, we set the `_filled` attribute to `False`, making the markers appear hollow. This change should address the issue described in the GitHub bug report.
