### Analysis:
The issue reported on GitHub indicates that the markers are not appearing hollow even when the fillstyle is set to 'none' using the `MarkerStyle`. This suggests that the `_recache` function within the `MarkerStyle` class is not correctly handling the fillstyle parameter.

### Potential Error Location:
The bug could be related to how the `_filled` attribute is being handled in the `_recache` function. The incorrect setting of `_filled` to `True` may be causing the markers to appear filled even when `fillstyle='none'` is specified.

### Cause of the Bug:
The bug is likely occurring due to the `_filled` attribute being set to `True` unconditionally in the `_recache` function. This causes the markers to always appear filled regardless of the specified `fillstyle`.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to update the `_recache` function to correctly handle the `fillstyle` parameter. Specifically, we should set the `_filled` attribute based on the value of `fillstyle`. If `fillstyle='none'`, then `_filled` should be set to `False` to make the markers hollow.

### Corrected Version:
```python
class MarkerStyle():
    def _recache(self):
        if self._marker_function is None:
            return
        self._path = _empty_path
        self._transform = IdentityTransform()
        self._alt_path = None
        self._alt_transform = None
        self._snap_threshold = None
        self._joinstyle = 'round'
        self._capstyle = 'butt'
        self._filled = self._fillstyle != 'none'  # Adjust _filled based on fillstyle
        self._marker_function()
```

In the corrected version, the `_filled` attribute is set based on the `fillstyle` parameter. If `fillstyle='none'`, then `_filled` is set to `False` to ensure that the markers appear hollow as intended.
