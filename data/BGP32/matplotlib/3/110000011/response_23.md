## Analysis:
The bug is related to markers not appearing as hollow when using `markers.MarkerStyle` with `fillstyle='none'` in the `ax.scatter()` function. The issue arises from setting the `_filled` attribute to `True` by default, causing the markers to be filled despite specifying `fillstyle='none'`.

## Bug Location:
The bug is located in the `_recache` method of the `MarkerStyle` class where the `_filled` attribute is set to `True` unconditionally.

## Cause of the Bug:
The bug occurs because the default value of `_filled` is set to `True`, which overrides the desired behavior of hollow markers specified by `fillstyle='none'`.

## Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to modify the `_recache` method to correctly handle the `fillstyle` parameter and set `_filled` based on whether the marker should be filled or not.

## Corrected Version:
```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: lib/matplotlib/markers.py

# The declaration of the class containing the corrected function
class MarkerStyle():
    # Corrected _recache method
    def _recache(self):
        if self._marker_function is None:
            return
        self._path = _empty_path
        self._transform = IdentityTransform()
        self._alt_path = None
        self._alt_transform = None
        self._snap_threshold = None
        self._joinstyle = 'round'
        self._capstyle = 'butt'
        self._filled = bool(self._fillstyle)  # Set _filled based on fillstyle
        self._marker_function()
```

With this correction, the `_filled` attribute will be set based on the `fillstyle` parameter, allowing markers to appear as hollow when `fillstyle='none'` is specified.
