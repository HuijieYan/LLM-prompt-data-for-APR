## Analysis:
The buggy function `_recache` within the `MarkerStyle` class is responsible for setting default values to various attributes of the class. In the buggy implementation, it attempts to call the `_marker_function` attribute without checking if it is initialized, which leads to potential issues.

## Identified Bug:
The bug arises from assuming that `_marker_function` is always initialized, leading to potential errors when it is not. This can result in unexpected behavior when trying to execute the function.

## Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that `_marker_function` is not `None` before attempting to call it. This will prevent any unintended executions and potential errors.

## The Corrected Version:
```python
# The corrected version of the buggy function within the class MarkerStyle
class MarkerStyle():
    def _recache(self):
        if self._marker_function is None:
            return
        
        self._path = _empty_path
        self._transform = IdentityTransform()
        self._alt_path = None
        self._alt_transform = None
        self._snap_threshold = None
        self._joinstyle = 'round'
        self._capstyle = 'butt'
        self._filled = True
        
        if callable(self._marker_function):
            self._marker_function()
``` 

In this corrected version, we first check if `_marker_function` is callable using the `callable()` function before attempting to call it. This ensures that the function is only executed if it is correctly initialized, preventing any potential issues.
