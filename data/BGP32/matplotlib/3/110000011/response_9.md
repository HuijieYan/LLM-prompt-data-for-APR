## Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_recache` is part of the `MarkerStyle` class in the `markers.py` file of the `matplotlib` library.
2. The issue reported on GitHub mentions that setting `fillstyle='none'` does not make markers hollow as expected.

## Identified bug:
The bug in the `_recache` function is that it sets `self._filled` to `True` unconditionally, which may override the desired behavior when trying to make the marker hollow by setting `fillstyle='none'`.

## Cause of the bug:
The bug is caused by the `_recache` function unconditionally setting `_filled = True`, leading to the markers not being hollow even when `fillstyle='none'` is specified.

## Fix strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to update the `_recache` function to consider the `fillstyle` parameter and adjust the `_filled` attribute accordingly.

## Corrected version of the `_recache` function:
```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    self._filled = self.get_fillstyle() != 'none'
    self._marker_function()
```

After making this correction, the `_filled` attribute will be set based on the `fillstyle` parameter, ensuring that markers can be made hollow by setting `fillstyle='none'`.
