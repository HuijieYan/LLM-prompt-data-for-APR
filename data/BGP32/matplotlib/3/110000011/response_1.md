### Analysis:
- The buggy function `_recache` in the `MarkerStyle` class is responsible for initializing various attributes when called.
- The issue described using `ax.scatter()` indicates that setting `fillstyle='none'` on a custom `MarkerStyle` object does not produce the expected result of hollow markers.

### Potential Error Locations:
1. The condition `if self._marker_function is None` before executing `_marker_function()` might lead to skipping setting essential attributes.
2. The default value for `_filled` being set to `True` might be contradicting the intention of producing hollow markers.

### Cause of the Bug:
The bug appears to be caused by the incorrect handling of marker style attributes within the `_recache` function. The setting of `_filled = True` along with possibly skipping the `_marker_function()` call based on a condition could result in markers appearing filled despite setting `fillstyle='none'`.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
1. Ensure that all necessary attributes for marker style are properly initialized within the `_recache` function.
2. Correctly handle the `fillstyle` parameter to achieve the desired hollow marker effect.

### Corrected Version:
```python
class MarkerStyle():
    def _recache(self):
        self._path = _empty_path
        self._transform = IdentityTransform()
        self._alt_path = None
        self._alt_transform = None
        self._snap_threshold = None
        self._joinstyle = 'round'
        self._capstyle = 'butt'
        self._filled = False  # Corrected to default as False for hollow markers
        if self._marker_function is not None:
            self._marker_function()
```

By making these corrections, the `_recache` function will ensure that the necessary attributes are correctly initialized, and the `filled` attribute is aligned with the intention of creating hollow markers when `fillstyle='none'` is set.
