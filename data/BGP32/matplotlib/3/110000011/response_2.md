### Analysis:
The buggy function `_recache` in the `MarkerStyle` class is responsible for setting initial values to different attributes of that class. The issue reported on GitHub indicates that when the `fillstyle` attribute is set to `'none'`, the markers are not hollow as expected.

### Identified Error Location:
The issue might be related to how the `_filled` attribute is being set to `True` unconditionally in the `_recache` function. This could be conflicting with the intention of making the markers hollow when `fillstyle` is set to `'none'`.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is likely caused by not handling the case when `fillstyle` is set to `'none'` properly. By setting `_filled = True` unconditionally, the markers may always be filled, regardless of the `fillstyle` attribute.

### Strategy for Fix:
To fix the bug, we should check the value of `fillstyle` and update the `_filled` attribute accordingly. If `fillstyle` is `'none'`, then `_filled` should be set to `False` to make the markers hollow.

### Corrected Version:
Here is the corrected version of the `_recache` function in the `MarkerStyle` class:

```python
class MarkerStyle():
    def _recache(self):
        if self._marker_function is None:
            return
        
        self._path = _empty_path
        self._transform = IdentityTransform()
        self._alt_path = None
        self._alt_transform = None
        self._snap_threshold = None
        self._joinstyle = 'round'
        self._capstyle = 'butt'
        
        if self.get_fillstyle() == 'none':
            self._filled = False
        else:
            self._filled = True
        
        self._marker_function()
```

By adding the condition to set `_filled` based on the `fillstyle` attribute value, we ensure that the markers will be hollow when `fillstyle` is set to `'none'`. This should resolve the issue reported on GitHub.
