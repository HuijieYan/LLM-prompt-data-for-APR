### Analysis:
The bug is occurring in the `_recache` method of the `MarkerStyle` class. The issue reported on GitHub indicates that setting `fillstyle='none'` does not result in hollow markers as expected. This bug is likely due to the incorrect handling of the `fillstyle` parameter within the `_recache` method.

### Error Location:
The bug is likely in the assignment of `_filled` in the `_recache` method. When setting `fillstyle='none'`, the `_filled` attribute should be False to indicate that the marker should be hollow.

### Cause of the Bug:
The bug is caused by not syncing the `filled` attribute with the `fillstyle` parameter. The implementation in the `_recache` method does not handle the case where `fillstyle='none'` correctly.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to update the `_recache` method to correctly set the `_filled` attribute based on the `fillstyle` parameter. If `fillstyle` is set to `'none'`, then `_filled` should be set to `False`.

### Corrected Version:
```python
class MarkerStyle():
    def _recache(self):
        if self._marker_function is None:
            return
        self._path = _empty_path
        self._transform = IdentityTransform()
        self._alt_path = None
        self._alt_transform = None
        self._snap_threshold = None
        self._joinstyle = 'round'
        self._capstyle = 'butt'
        # Update _filled based on fillstyle
        if self.get_fillstyle() == 'full':
            self._filled = True
        else:
            self._filled = False
        self._marker_function()
```

In the corrected version, we added a condition to correctly set the `_filled` attribute based on the `fillstyle` parameter. This change ensures that setting `fillstyle='none'` will result in hollow markers as intended.
