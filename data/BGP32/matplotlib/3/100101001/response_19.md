### Analysis
The buggy function `_recache` is supposed to reset certain attributes of a marker style object to their default values and then call a marker function. However, there seems to be an issue with resetting the `_filled` attribute to `True` unconditionally. This may prevent the `is_filled()` method from returning the correct value in certain cases.

### Bug Cause
The bug lies in the unconditional assignment of `self._filled = True` in the `_recache` function. This may interfere with the expected behavior of the `is_filled()` method in certain scenarios where the `_filled` attribute should be set to `False`.

### Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we should only set `self._filled = True` if the marker function being called requires the marker to be filled. Otherwise, it should be set to `False`. This approach will ensure that the `is_filled()` method returns the correct value based on the specific marker style.

### Corrected Function
```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    self._filled = self._marker_function.needs_filling()  # Set _filled based on marker function requirement
    self._marker_function()
``` 

By modifying the assignment of `self._filled`, the corrected function will now set the `_filled` attribute based on the requirement of the marker function being called, ensuring consistency with the expected behavior.
