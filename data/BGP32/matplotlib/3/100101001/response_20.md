### Cause of the bug:
The bug seems to be caused by the `_marker_function` not being called correctly or not updating the necessary attributes within the `_recache` function. This leads to the test failing as the `get_fillstyle()` method relies on correct values of `_filled` to determine the fill style of the marker.

### Bug fix strategy:
1. Ensure that the `_marker_function` is being called properly within the `_recache` function.
2. Make sure that the necessary attributes (`_filled` in this case) are being updated correctly based on the marker styles.

### Corrected version of the function:
```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    self._filled = True
    self._marker_function()

```
