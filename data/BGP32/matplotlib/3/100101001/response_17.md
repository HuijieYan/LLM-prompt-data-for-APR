The bug in the `_recache` function lies in the assignment of `self._path` to `_empty_path` instead of a valid Path object. As seen in the runtime values and types, `self._path` is set to `_empty_path`, which is incorrect and causes the test to fail.

To fix this bug, we need to ensure that `self._path` is assigned a valid Path object. We can update the `self._path` assignment to use a valid Path object instead of `_empty_path`.

Here is the corrected version of the `_recache` function:

```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = Path()  # Assign a new Path object here
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    self._filled = True
    self._marker_function()
```

With this correction, the test should now pass as `self._path` is correctly assigned a valid Path object.
