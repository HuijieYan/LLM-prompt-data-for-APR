### Analysis
The `_recache` function is supposed to reset certain attributes of the MarkerStyle object. However, based on the provided runtime values, it seems that some variables are not being properly reset or initialized, leading to incorrect behavior.

#### Identified Issues:
1. `_path` is not correctly reset to `_empty_path`.
2. `_snap_threshold` is not reset to `None`.
3. `_filled` is not reset to `False`.

### Bug Cause:
The buggy function is not correctly resetting all the necessary attributes, leading to incorrect behavior in the MarkerStyle object.

### Fix Strategy:
1. Reset `_path` to `_empty_path`.
2. Set `_snap_threshold` to `None`.
3. Set `_filled` to `False`.

### Corrected Version
```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None  # Reset snap_threshold to None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    self._filled = False  # Reset filled to False
    self._marker_function()
```
