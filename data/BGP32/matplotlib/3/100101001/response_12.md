### Analysis
The `_recache` function initializes several variables to default values when `self._marker_function` is not None. However, it seems that the `_marker_function` is not being called to update the necessary variables correctly, leading to the failing test due to incorrect values being returned.

### Bug Explanation
In this case, the `_marker_function` is not being called after resetting the variables to default values. This results in the variables not being updated correctly based on the actual marker function, leading to incorrect return values.

### Fix
To fix this issue, we need to ensure that the `_marker_function` is called after resetting the variables to default values. This way, the variables will be correctly updated based on the marker function provided. 

### Corrected Version
```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    self._filled = True
    self._marker_function()
``` 

By ensuring that `_marker_function` is called at the end of the `_recache` function, the variables will be updated correctly based on the required marker function, resolving the bug.
