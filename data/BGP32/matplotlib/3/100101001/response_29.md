### Bug Explanation
The bug in the `_recache` function arises from the fact that it fails to properly set the value of `self._marker_function()` when `self._marker_function` is not `None`. This means that the function does not actually execute the marker function as intended, causing issues with the markers' appearance and properties.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the `_recache` function correctly calls `self._marker_function()` when it is not `None`. This will ensure that the marker properties are properly updated and applied.

### Corrected Version of the Function
```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is not None:
        self._path = _empty_path
        self._transform = IdentityTransform()
        self._alt_path = None
        self._alt_transform = None
        self._snap_threshold = None
        self._joinstyle = 'round'
        self._capstyle = 'butt'
        self._filled = True
        self._marker_function()
``` 

By making this change, the `_recache` function will now call the `_marker_function()` properly when it is not `None`, resolving the bug and ensuring that markers are displayed correctly.
