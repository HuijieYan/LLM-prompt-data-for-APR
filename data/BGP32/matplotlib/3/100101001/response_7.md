### Analysis:
The `_recache` function is resetting several attributes to default values and then calling the `_marker_function`, which is likely responsible for setting up the actual marker properties. However, in the provided buggy code, the `_marker_function` is called regardless of whether it is `None` or not, leading to unexpected behavior.

### Bug Cause:
The bug arises from the unconditional execution of `_marker_function`, which may result in errors if `_marker_function` is `None`.

### Fix Strategy:
Check if `_marker_function` is not `None` before calling it in the `_recache` function to avoid errors when it is not properly set.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is not None:
        self._path = _empty_path
        self._transform = IdentityTransform()
        self._alt_path = None
        self._alt_transform = None
        self._snap_threshold = None
        self._joinstyle = 'round'
        self._capstyle = 'butt'
        self._filled = True
        self._marker_function()
``` 

By adding the check `if self._marker_function is not None:`, we ensure that the `_marker_function` is only called if it exists, preventing errors when it is `None`.
