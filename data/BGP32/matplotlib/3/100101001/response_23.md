The bug in the `_recache` function is that it doesn't set the `_marker_function` attribute correctly before calling it. This results in a `NoneType` object being called as a function, leading to a `TypeError`.

To fix this bug, we need to ensure that `_marker_function` is properly set before calling it. We can validate if the function exists before executing it.

Here is the corrected version of the `_recache` function:

```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is not None:
        self._path = _empty_path
        self._transform = IdentityTransform()
        self._alt_path = None
        self._alt_transform = None
        self._snap_threshold = None
        self._joinstyle = 'round'
        self._capstyle = 'butt'
        self._filled = True
        self._marker_function()
```

By checking if `_marker_function` is not `None` before executing it, we ensure that the function is valid and avoid the `TypeError`. This correction should make the failing test `test_marker_fillstyle` pass successfully.
