### Bug Analysis
The bug in the `_recache` function lies in the fact that it is trying to invoke `self._marker_function()` without checking if `self._marker_function` is actually defined. This leads to an AttributeError when `self._marker_function` is `None`.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to add a check to ensure that `self._marker_function` is not `None` before trying to invoke it.

### Corrected Version of the Function
```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is not None:
        self._path = _empty_path
        self._transform = IdentityTransform()
        self._alt_path = None
        self._alt_transform = None
        self._snap_threshold = None
        self._joinstyle = 'round'
        self._capstyle = 'butt'
        self._filled = True
        self._marker_function()
``` 

By adding the check `if self._marker_function is not None:`, we ensure that the function will only attempt to call `self._marker_function()` if it actually exists, preventing the AttributeError and fixing the bug.
