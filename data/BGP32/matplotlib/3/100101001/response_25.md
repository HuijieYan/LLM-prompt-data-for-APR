### Explanation:
The buggy function `_recache` is supposed to reset certain attributes of the MarkerStyle object to their initial values and then call the `_marker_function`. However, the problem lies in the fact that it is not properly resetting `self._filled` to `False` as expected by the failing test `test_marker_fillstyle`.

### Strategy for fixing the bug:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that `self._filled` is set to `False` instead of `True` during the reset process in the `_recache` function.

### Corrected version of the function:
```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    self._filled = False  # Update to set filled to False
    self._marker_function()
``` 

By updating the `_filled` attribute to `False`, the corrected function now properly resets the `filled` status to match the expectations of the failing test, `test_marker_fillstyle`.
