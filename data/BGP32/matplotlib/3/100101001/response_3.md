### Analysis
The `_recache` function sets some attributes to default values and then calls a marker function which is expected to update these attributes based on the specific marker style being used. In the failing test case provided, the marker style is set to 'o' (circle) with fillstyle 'none', meaning the marker should not be filled.

### Bug Cause
The bug is likely in the marker function that is being called at the end of `_recache`, as it is not correctly updating the `_filled` attribute based on the fillstyle parameter.

### Fix Strategy
To fix this bug, the marker function needs to correctly update the `_filled` attribute based on the fillstyle specified in the marker style. If the fillstyle is 'none', then `_filled` should be set to `False`.

### Corrected Function
```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    self._filled = True
    if self._marker_function.__name__ == '_set_marker':
        if self.get_fillstyle() == 'none':
            self._filled = False
    else:
        self._marker_function()
```

With this correction, the `_filled` attribute will be updated correctly based on the fillstyle specified in the marker style, allowing the failing test to pass.
