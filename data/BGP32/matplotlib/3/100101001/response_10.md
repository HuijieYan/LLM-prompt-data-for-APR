### Analyzing the buggy function and failing test
The `_recache` function in the `markers.py` file is intended to reset various properties such as `_path`, `_transform`, and others when a marker function is available. However, based on the failing test `test_marker_fillstyle` in the `test_marker.py` file, it seems that the `MarkerStyle` instance is not correctly handling the `fillstyle='none'` parameter, which indicates a potential issue with the `_recache` function.

### Bug identification
From the runtime values provided in Case 1, we can see that the `_filled` variable is set to `True`, which contradicts the expected behavior when the `fillstyle='none'` parameter is used in the test. This discrepancy points to a bug in the `_recache` function where it is not correctly handling the `fillstyle` parameter.

### Bug cause
The bug occurs because the `_recache` function is not considering the `fillstyle` property when initializing the `_filled` variable. This leads to the incorrect behavior observed in the failing test.

### Fix strategy
To fix this bug, we need to modify the `_recache` function to take into account the `fillstyle` property passed to the `MarkerStyle` instance and correctly update the `_filled` variable based on this information.

### Corrected version of the function
```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    self._filled = self.get_fillstyle() != 'none'
    self._marker_function()
``` 

By updating the `_filled` variable based on the `fillstyle` property, the corrected `_recache` function should now handle the `fillstyle='none'` parameter correctly and pass the failing test.
