### Bug Explanation
The bug in the `_recache` function lies in the line where `_marker_function` is called without checking if it is a callable object. This can lead to an error if `_marker_function` is not defined or not a callable object.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix this bug, we need to check if `_marker_function` is callable before invoking it. If it is not callable, we can handle this situation gracefully by doing nothing or raising an exception.

### Corrected Version of the Function
```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is not None and callable(self._marker_function):
        self._path = _empty_path
        self._transform = IdentityTransform()
        self._alt_path = None
        self._alt_transform = None
        self._snap_threshold = None
        self._joinstyle = 'round'
        self._capstyle = 'butt'
        self._filled = True
        self._marker_function()
``` 

By adding the `if self._marker_function is not None and callable(self._marker_function):` condition, we ensure that `_marker_function` is only called if it is not `None` and callable, thus preventing any potential errors.
