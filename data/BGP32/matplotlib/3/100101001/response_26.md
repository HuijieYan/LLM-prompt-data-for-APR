The bug in the `_recache` function is that it tries to call `self._marker_function` without checking if it is defined or not. This results in a `NoneType` object not callable error when the function tries to execute it.

To fix this issue, we need to add a check to ensure that `self._marker_function` is not None before trying to call it.

Here is the corrected version of the `_recache` function:

```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: lib/matplotlib/markers.py

# This is the corrected version of the buggy function
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is not None:
        self._path = _empty_path
        self._transform = IdentityTransform()
        self._alt_path = None
        self._alt_transform = None
        self._snap_threshold = None
        self._joinstyle = 'round'
        self._capstyle = 'butt'
        self._filled = True
        self._marker_function()
```

With this fix, the `_recache` function will only call `_marker_function` if it is defined, preventing the `NoneType` error and allowing the function to run correctly as intended.
