### Bug Analysis:
The `_recache` function in the `markers.py` file is supposed to reset certain attributes to default values if `self._marker_function` is None. However, in the provided implementation, it seems that the function always calls `self._marker_function()` even if it's not supposed to.

### Bug Explanation:
In the failing test case `test_marker_fillstyle`, the test expects the marker's fillstyle to be `'none'` and that it is not filled. If the `_marker_function` is not None and is actually a function that sets the fillstyle to something other than `'none'`, the test will fail.

### Bug Fix:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the `_marker_function` is only called if it's not None. We can do this by adding a simple condition to check if `self._marker_function` is not None before calling it.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is not None:
        self._path = _empty_path
        self._transform = IdentityTransform()
        self._alt_path = None
        self._alt_transform = None
        self._snap_threshold = None
        self._joinstyle = 'round'
        self._capstyle = 'butt'
        self._filled = True
        self._marker_function()
``` 

By making this change, the `_marker_function` will only be called when it is not None, which should address the bug and make the failing test pass.
