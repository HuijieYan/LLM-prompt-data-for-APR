The bug in the `_recache` function lies in the assumption that `self._marker_function` is always defined. When it's not, the function encounters an error. In the scenario outlined in Case 1, the `self._marker_function` is not defined, causing the function to fail.

To fix this bug, we should add a check to ensure that `self._marker_function` is not `None` before trying to call it.

Here is the corrected version of the `_recache` function:

```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function:
        self._path = _empty_path
        self._transform = IdentityTransform()
        self._alt_path = None
        self._alt_transform = None
        self._snap_threshold = None
        self._joinstyle = 'round'
        self._capstyle = 'butt'
        self._filled = True
        self._marker_function()
``` 

With this fix, the function will only attempt to call `self._marker_function` if it's not `None`, resolving the bug identified in the failing test case.
