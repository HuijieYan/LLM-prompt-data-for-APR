The issue in the `_recache` function is that it is setting `self._path` to `_empty_path` regardless of its current state. This leads to losing the actual path data, causing the failure of the test case `test_marker_fillstyle`.

### Bug Cause
The bug causes the `_path` variable to be replaced with an empty path, resulting in the loss of the marker shape data. This issue affects the `is_filled` check in the test case, as the marker's fillstyle is determined by the shape path.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug
To fix this bug, we need to check if the `_path` attribute is empty before assigning `_empty_path` to it. If `_path` is not empty, it should remain unchanged.

### Corrected Version of the Function
```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return

    if self._path is _empty_path:
        self._path = Path()
    else:
        self._path = _empty_path

    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    self._filled = True
    self._marker_function()
``` 

By making this change, the function will preserve the existing path data if it is not already empty, fixing the bug. This corrected version should pass the failing test `test_marker_fillstyle`.
