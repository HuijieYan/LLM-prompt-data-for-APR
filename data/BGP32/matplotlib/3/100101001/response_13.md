### Analysis
The `_recache` function initializes certain attributes and then calls the `_marker_function` method. However, the `_marker_function` method is not defined within the provided code snippet, which indicates that there may be an issue with the missing implementation of this method.

### Bug Cause
The bug is likely caused by the missing implementation of the `_marker_function` method that is being called at the end of the `_recache` function. Since the `_marker_function` method is not defined, calling it leads to a failure in the test due to an AttributeError.

### Proposed Fix
To fix the bug, the `_marker_function` method should be implemented or removed if unnecessary. If the `MarkerStyle` class has a method named `_marker_function`, it should be defined with the necessary logic. If it is not needed, the call to `_marker_function` should be removed.

### Corrected Version
```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is not None:  # Check if _marker_function is defined
        self._path = _empty_path
        self._transform = IdentityTransform()
        self._alt_path = None
        self._alt_transform = None
        self._snap_threshold = None
        self._joinstyle = 'round'
        self._capstyle = 'butt'
        self._filled = True
        self._marker_function()   # Call _marker_function if it is defined
``` 

By either implementing the `_marker_function` method or removing the unnecessary call to it, the corrected version will prevent the AttributeError and pass the failing test.
