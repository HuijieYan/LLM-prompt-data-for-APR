The issue in the `_recache` function is that it calls `self._marker_function()` unconditionally without considering whether `_marker_function` is None or not. This results in an error when `self._marker_function` is None.

### Cause of the bug:
In the failing test `test_marker_fillstyle`, the `MarkerStyle` object is created with `fillstyle='none'`, which should result in `marker.is_filled()` being False. However, due to the unconditional call to `self._marker_function()` in the buggy `_recache` function, it overrides the expected behavior.

### Strategy for fixing the bug:
To fix the bug, we need to make sure that `_marker_function` is only called when it is not None. We can achieve this by adding a conditional check before calling `_marker_function`.

### Corrected version of the function:
```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is not None:
        self._path = _empty_path
        self._transform = IdentityTransform()
        self._alt_path = None
        self._alt_transform = None
        self._snap_threshold = None
        self._joinstyle = 'round'
        self._capstyle = 'butt'
        self._filled = True
        self._marker_function()
``` 

By adding the `if self._marker_function is not None:` check before calling `_marker_function()`, the function will only execute when `_marker_function` is defined, and the failing test should now pass.
