### Analysis
The `_recache` function initializes several attributes of the `MarkerStyle` class with default values and then calls the `_marker_function` method. However, the bug seems to be that the `_marker_function` is not set properly, leading it to not be called when expected. This causes the `MarkerStyle` object to not be correctly updated with the desired attributes.

### Bug Cause
The bug is caused by the `_marker_function` not being assigned a proper function, so it's not executed as intended.

### Fix Strategy
To fix this bug, we need to ensure that `_marker_function` is assigned with the correct function that updates the `MarkerStyle` object as expected.

### Corrected Version
```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    self._filled = True
    self._marker_function()
```

With this correction, the `_recache` function should now correctly call the `_marker_function`, updating the `MarkerStyle` object as intended.
