## Analysis
The buggy function `_recache` is a method of the `MarkerStyle` class. It initializes several attributes of the `MarkerStyle` instance when called. However, the issue arises when the `_marker_function` attribute is called without performing the necessary updates on the instance attributes. This can result in unexpected behavior, such as markers not being hollow when the fillstyle is set to 'none'.

### Error Location
The main error in the `_recache` function is that it calls `self._marker_function()` before updating the necessary attributes that are relevant to marker rendering. This can lead to incorrect marker styles being used.

### Bug Cause
In the provided case, the `filled` attribute is set to `True` by default, which is not suitable for creating a hollow marker. When `self._marker_function()` is called afterwards, it may ignore the `fillstyle='none'` setting specified in the constructor.

### Fix Strategy
To address this issue, we need to update the relevant attributes, such as `filled`, `joinstyle`, and `capstyle`, before calling `self._marker_function()` to ensure that the specified marker style, including hollow markers, is properly applied.

### Solution
Here is the corrected version of the `_recache` function within the `MarkerStyle` class:

```python
class MarkerStyle:
    def _recache(self):
        if self._marker_function is None:
            return
        self._path = _empty_path
        self._transform = IdentityTransform()
        self._alt_path = None
        self._alt_transform = None
        self._snap_threshold = None
        self._joinstyle = 'round'
        self._capstyle = 'butt'
        
        # Update filled attribute based on fillstyle
        self._filled = self.get_fillstyle() != 'none'
        
        self._marker_function()
        
    def get_fillstyle(self):
        # Extract the fillstyle from current marker style
        return getattr(self, 'fillstyle', 'full')
```

By updating the `filled` attribute based on the specified `fillstyle`, we ensure that the markers are rendered correctly, including the desired hollow appearance when appropriate.

This fix should address the issue reported on GitHub regarding markers not being hollow when `fillstyle='none'`.
