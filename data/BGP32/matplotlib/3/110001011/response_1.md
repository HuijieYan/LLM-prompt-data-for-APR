### Analysis
The buggy function `_recache()` inside the `MarkerStyle` class initializes various attributes related to the marker style. The issue reported on GitHub indicates that when setting `fillstyle='none'`, the markers are not hollow as expected when using `ax.scatter()`. This suggests that the `_marker_function()` call inside `_recache()` might not be handling the `fillstyle='none'` correctly.

### Error Location
The potential error location is likely within the `_marker_function()` that is called at the end of `_recache()`. The `_marker_function()` is responsible for defining the shape of the marker based on the current marker style attributes, including whether it should be hollow or not.

### Bug Cause
The bug is likely caused by the incorrect implementation of `_marker_function()` or the missing logic to handle `fillstyle='none'`. This leads to the markers not being rendered as hollow despite setting `fillstyle='none'`. The existing implementation does not properly handle the case where `fillstyle` should result in a hollow marker shape.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the `_marker_function()` correctly interprets the `fillstyle` attribute and generates a hollow marker shape when `fillstyle='none'`. This logic needs to be implemented within `_marker_function()` based on the given marker style attributes.

### Corrected Version
```python
class MarkerStyle():
    def _recache(self):
        if self._marker_function is None:
            return
        self._path = _empty_path
        self._transform = IdentityTransform()
        self._alt_path = None
        self._alt_transform = None
        self._snap_threshold = None
        self._joinstyle = 'round'
        self._capstyle = 'butt'
        self._filled = True
        if self._fillstyle == 'none':
            self._filled = False
        self._marker_function()
```

In the corrected version, the `_recache()` function now checks if `fillstyle` is set to `'none'` and updates the `_filled` attribute accordingly to ensure that the marker is drawn as hollow when needed. This modification should address the issue reported on GitHub where the markers were not rendered hollow when using `ax.scatter()` and setting `fillstyle='none'`.
