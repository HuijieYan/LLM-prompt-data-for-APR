## Analysis
1. The buggy function `_recache` is related to the `MarkerStyle` class in the `markers.py` file in the `lib/matplotlib` directory.
2. The function initializes several attributes of the `MarkerStyle` class but fails to properly recache the marker properties.
3. The bug seems to be related to the failure to update the `_path` attribute based on the `_marker_function`.
4. To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the `_marker_function` correctly updates the `_path` attribute.
   
## Bug Cause
The bug causes the `_path` attribute to remain as `_empty_path` instead of being updated by the `_marker_function`. This issue leads to incorrect marker display when trying to set markers as hollow.

## Bug Fix
To fix the bug, we need to modify the `_recache` function to correctly update the `_path` attribute based on the `_marker_function`. Below is the corrected version of the function:

```python
class MarkerStyle():
    def _recache(self):
        if self._marker_function is None:
            return
        self._path = _empty_path
        self._transform = IdentityTransform()
        self._alt_path = None
        self._alt_transform = None
        self._snap_threshold = None
        self._joinstyle = 'round'
        self._capstyle = 'butt'
        self._filled = True
        self._marker_function()
        self._path, self._transform = self._marker_function()  # Update _path and _transform based on _marker_function
```

By updating the `_path` and `_transform` attributes using the output of the `_marker_function`, we ensure that the marker properties are correctly recached and the markers are displayed as hollow when setting `fillstyle='none'` as mentioned in the GitHub issue.
