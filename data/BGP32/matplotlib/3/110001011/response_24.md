### Analysis:
1. The `_recache` function in the `MarkerStyle` class is responsible for resetting various attributes related to the marker style.
2. The issue reported on GitHub suggests that setting `fillstyle='none'` does not result in hollow markers as expected.
3. In the provided scenario, the `_filled` attribute is set to `True` by default in the `_recache` function, which overrides the intended behavior of having hollow markers.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is caused by the `_filled` attribute being set to `True` by default in the `_recache` function, even when `fillstyle='none'` is specified. This prevents the markers from being hollow as intended.

### Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to update the `_filled` attribute based on the provided `fillstyle` parameter. If the `fillstyle` is set to `'none'`, then `_filled` should be set to `False` to achieve hollow markers.

### Corrected Version:
Below is the corrected version of the `_recache` function in the `MarkerStyle` class:

```python
class MarkerStyle:
    def _recache(self):
        if self._marker_function is None:
            return
        self._path = _empty_path
        self._transform = IdentityTransform()
        self._alt_path = None
        self._alt_transform = None
        self._snap_threshold = None
        self._joinstyle = 'round'
        self._capstyle = 'butt'
        self._filled = False if self._fillstyle == 'none' else True  # Update _filled based on fillstyle
        self._marker_function()
```

By updating the `_filled` attribute based on the `fillstyle` parameter, the corrected version ensures that setting `fillstyle='none'` results in hollow markers as intended.
