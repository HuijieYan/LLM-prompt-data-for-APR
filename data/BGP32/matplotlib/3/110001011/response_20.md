### Analysis
- The `MarkerStyle` class contains a `_recache` function that is responsible for recalculating the marker style properties.
- The issue reported on GitHub indicates that setting the `fillstyle` parameter to `'none'` is not resulting in hollow markers as expected.
- The buggy function resets various properties of the marker style but does not handle the `fillstyle` issue appropriately, which leads to the markers not being hollow as desired.

### Bug Cause
- The `_recache` function is not handling the `fillstyle` property, which is crucial for determining whether the markers should be filled or hollow.

### Bug Fix Strategy
- Modify the `_recache` function to check the `fillstyle` property and adjust the `_filled` property accordingly to ensure that the markers are hollow when `fillstyle` is set to `'none'`.

### Corrected Version
```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: lib/matplotlib/markers.py

# The declaration of the class containing the corrected function
class MarkerStyle():

    def _recache(self):
        if self._marker_function is None:
            return
        self._path = _empty_path
        self._transform = IdentityTransform()
        self._alt_path = None
        self._alt_transform = None
        self._snap_threshold = None
        self._joinstyle = 'round'
        self._capstyle = 'butt'
        self._filled = True
        
        if self.get_fillstyle() == 'none':
            self._filled = False
        
        self._marker_function()
```

In the corrected version, an additional check is added to determine the `fillstyle`. If the `fillstyle` is set to `'none'`, the `_filled` property is set to `False` to ensure that the markers are hollow when rendered.
