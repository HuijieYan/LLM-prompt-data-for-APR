### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_recache` in the `MarkerStyle` class is supposed to reinitialize various attributes when called. However, there is a bug in how the `_marker_function` is being called, possibly leading to unexpected behavior.
2. The bug seems to be related to the incorrect handling or missing definition of `_marker_function`. This function should be defined within the class to properly update the marker properties.
3. The bug causes the markers to not behave as expected when the `fillstyle='none'` is set, as reported in the GitHub issue. The `_marker_function` should be correctly updating the marker properties based on the input parameters.
4. To fix the bug:
   - Define a proper `_marker_function` within the `MarkerStyle` class that updates the marker properties based on the input parameters like `fillstyle`.
   - Modify the `_recache` function to call the `_marker_function` with the appropriate logic.
   - Ensure that the `_path`, `_transform`, `_alt_path`, `_alt_transform`, `_snap_threshold`, `_joinstyle`, `_capstyle`, and `_filled` attributes are correctly initialized and updated by `_marker_function`.
5. Here is a corrected version of the `_recache` function within the `MarkerStyle` class:
```python
class MarkerStyle():
    def _recache(self):
        if self._marker_function is None:
            return
        self._path = _empty_path
        self._transform = IdentityTransform()
        self._alt_path = None
        self._alt_transform = None
        self._snap_threshold = None
        self._joinstyle = 'round'
        self._capstyle = 'butt'
        self._filled = True
        self._marker_function()
```

By implementing the correct logic within the `_marker_function` and ensuring it is properly called in `_recache`, the issue reported on GitHub should be resolved.
