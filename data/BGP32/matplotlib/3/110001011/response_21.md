### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_recache` is a method of the `MarkerStyle` class.
2. The function initializes various attributes of the `MarkerStyle` instance such as `_path`, `_transform`, `_alt_path`, `_alt_transform`, `_snap_threshold`, `_joinstyle`, `_capstyle`, `_filled`, and then calls the `_marker_function`.
3. The issue reported on GitHub indicates that setting the `fillstyle` parameter to `'none'` does not make the markers hollow as expected when using `ax.scatter()`.
4. The function sets `_filled` to `True` unconditionally, which causes the markers to always be filled despite setting `fillstyle='none'`.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is caused by the `_filled` attribute being set to `True` by default and not being affected by any parameter passed to `MarkerStyle`. This leads to markers being filled even when `fillstyle='none'` is specified.

### Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to update the `_filled` attribute based on the value of `fillstyle` passed to the `MarkerStyle` constructor. If `fillstyle` is `'none'`, we should set `_filled` to `False` to ensure that the markers are drawn as hollow.

### Corrected Version:
```python
class MarkerStyle():
    def _recache(self):
        if self._marker_function is None:
            return
        self._path = _empty_path
        self._transform = IdentityTransform()
        self._alt_path = None
        self._alt_transform = None
        self._snap_threshold = None
        self._joinstyle = 'round'
        self._capstyle = 'butt'
        self._filled = True
        
        if self.fillstyle == 'none':
            self._filled = False
            
        self._marker_function()
```

By checking the `fillstyle` attribute and updating the `_filled` attribute accordingly, the corrected version ensures that markers are drawn as hollow when `fillstyle='none'` is specified.
