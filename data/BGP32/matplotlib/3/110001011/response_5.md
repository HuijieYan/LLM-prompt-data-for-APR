### Analysis
1. The `MarkerStyle` class contains the `_recache` function that is intended to reset certain attributes such as `_path`, `_transform`, `_snap_threshold`, etc. However, after resetting these attributes, it calls the `_marker_function` which is not defined in the provided code snippet.
   
2. This bug is likely causing unexpected behavior in setting markers as hollow when using `ax.scatter()` and `MarkerStyle` with `fillstyle='none'`, as reported in the GitHub issue.

### Bug Cause
The bug is caused by the `_marker_function` call in the `_recache` function. Since `_marker_function` is not defined in the code snippet provided, it causes an error or unexpected behavior. This error prevents the intended behavior of setting markers as hollow.

### Bug Fix Strategy
1. Remove the call to `_marker_function` in the `_recache` function since it is not defined.
2. Ensure that the necessary attributes are properly reset according to the intended functionality.

### Corrected Version
```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: lib/matplotlib/markers.py

# The corrected class which includes the fixed function
class MarkerStyle():


    def _recache(self):
        self._path = _empty_path
        self._transform = IdentityTransform()
        self._alt_path = None
        self._alt_transform = None
        self._snap_threshold = None
        self._joinstyle = 'round'
        self._capstyle = 'butt'
        self._filled = True
```

By removing the call to the undefined `_marker_function` and ensuring that the attribute resets behave as intended, the corrected version of the function should now work without causing errors and fulfill the desired functionality as reported in the GitHub issue.
