### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_recache` is a method of the `MarkerStyle` class.
2. The function sets various attributes of the `MarkerStyle` instance to default values or `None`, and then calls the `_marker_function`, which is not defined in the provided code.
3. The issue reported on GitHub indicates that setting `fillstyle='none'` does not result in hollow markers as expected. This points to a potential problem in the handling of marker filling in the `_recache` function.
4. The `_filled` attribute is set to `True` unconditionally, which may be causing the markers to be filled despite specifying `fillstyle='none'`.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is likely caused by the `_filled` attribute being set to `True` unconditionally in the `_recache` function, overriding the desired behavior of hollow markers when `fillstyle='none'` is specified.

### Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, the `_filled` attribute should be set based on the value of `fillstyle`. If `fillstyle='none'`, then `_filled` should be set to `False` to render hollow markers.

### Corrected Version:
```python
# The corrected version of the buggy function

class MarkerStyle():

    def _recache(self):
        if self._marker_function is None:
            return
        self._path = _empty_path
        self._transform = IdentityTransform()
        self._alt_path = None
        self._alt_transform = None
        self._snap_threshold = None
        self._joinstyle = 'round'
        self._capstyle = 'butt'
        
        if self.get_fillstyle() == 'none':
            self._filled = False
        else:
            self._filled = True
        
        self._marker_function()
```

In the corrected version, the `_filled` attribute is set based on the value of `fillstyle`. If `fillstyle` is set to `'none'`, then `_filled` is set to `False` to ensure that markers are rendered as hollow when specified by the user.
