### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_recache` is supposed to reset certain attributes of the MarkerStyle object. However, it appears that the `_marker_function` is called at the end of the function without properly reinitializing the other attributes before that. This can lead to unexpected behavior, like markers not appearing as hollow when `fillstyle='none'` is set.
2. Based on the GitHub issue, the problem arises when trying to create hollow markers, which aligns with the improper behavior of the `_recache` function.
3. The `_recache` function fails to correctly reset the marker attributes, resulting in markers not being displayed as hollow as desired by the user.
4. To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the relevant attributes of the MarkerStyle object are properly reset before invoking the `_marker_function`.
5. Here is the corrected version of the `MarkerStyle` class with the fixed `_recache` function:

### Corrected Version:
```python
# The declaration of the class containing the buggy function
class MarkerStyle():

    # Corrected _recache function
    def _recache(self):
        if self._marker_function is None:
            return
        
        # Reset necessary attributes
        self._path = _empty_path
        self._transform = IdentityTransform()
        self._alt_path = None
        self._alt_transform = None
        
        # Ensure markers are displayed as hollow when fillstyle is set to 'none'
        if self.get_fillstyle() == 'none':
            self._filled = False
        else:
            self._filled = True
        
        # Reset other attributes
        self._snap_threshold = None
        self._joinstyle = 'round'
        self._capstyle = 'butt
        
        self._marker_function()
```

By properly resetting the attributes and handling the `fillstyle` appropriately within the `_recache` function, the markers should now display as hollow when `fillstyle='none'` is set, addressing the issue reported on GitHub.
