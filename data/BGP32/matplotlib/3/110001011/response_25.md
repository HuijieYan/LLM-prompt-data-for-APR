### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_recache` in the `MarkerStyle` class is not correctly updating the attributes when `_marker_function` is not `None`.
2. The function currently resets the attributes to default values without actually calling the `_marker_function`.
3. The issue on GitHub suggests that setting `fillstyle='none'` does not result in hollow markers as expected, indicating a problem with the function that handles marker styles.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is caused by the `_recache` function not correctly applying the marker function when it is not `None`, leading to incorrect marker styles in the plot.

### Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the `_marker_function` is called to correctly update the marker attributes based on its implementation.

### Corrected Version:
```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: lib/matplotlib/markers.py

# The declaration of the class containing the corrected function
class MarkerStyle():

    def _recache(self):
        if self._marker_function is not None:
            self._marker_function()
```

By modifying the `_recache` function to call `_marker_function` only when it is not `None`, the corrected version ensures that the marker attributes are updated appropriately based on the implementation of the marker function. This fix should address the issue reported on GitHub regarding hollow markers not being displayed correctly.
