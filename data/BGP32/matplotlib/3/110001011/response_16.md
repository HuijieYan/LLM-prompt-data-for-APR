## Analysis
The buggy function `_recache` in the `MarkerStyle` class is not correctly handling the case when the `_marker_function` is not `None`. It initializes certain attributes unconditionally without checking the state of `_marker_function`. This is a critical issue as it can lead to incorrect behavior when creating marker styles.

The GitHub issue is related to setting markers to be hollow by using `fillstyle='none'`, but the bug in `_recache` function might prevent this desired behavior from being achieved. The initialization of `_filled` to `True` inside `_recache` function might be causing the markers to be filled instead of hollow.

## Bug Cause
The bug is caused by the unconditional setting of `_filled` to `True` within the `_recache` function, regardless of the state of `_marker_function`. This causes markers to be filled even when `fillstyle='none'` is specified.

## Strategy for Fixing the Bug
To fix the bug, we need to update the `_recache` function to correctly handle the situation when `_marker_function` is not `None`. We should make sure that the `_filled` attribute is set according to the `fillstyle` specified in the marker style.

## Corrected Version
```python
class MarkerStyle():
    def _recache(self):
        if self._marker_function is None:
            return
        self._path = _empty_path
        self._transform = IdentityTransform()
        self._alt_path = None
        self._alt_transform = None
        self._snap_threshold = None
        self._joinstyle = 'round'
        self._capstyle = 'butt'
        
        if 'fillstyle' in self._marker_function.keywords:
            fillstyle = self._marker_function.keywords['fillstyle']
            self._filled = fillstyle != 'none'
        else:
            self._filled = True
        
        self._marker_function()
```

In the corrected version, we check if the `fillstyle` is specified in the `_marker_function` and set `_filled` accordingly. This change ensures that markers are filled or hollow based on the `fillstyle` attribute set in the marker style.
