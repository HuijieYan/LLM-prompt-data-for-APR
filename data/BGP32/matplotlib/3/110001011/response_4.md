### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_recache` is a method of the `MarkerStyle` class.
2. The function is supposed to reset certain attributes of the `MarkerStyle` instance, based on the value of `_marker_function`. However, the function does not properly handle the case when `_marker_function` is `None`.
3. The function incorrectly tries to execute `_marker_function` without checking if it is `None`, which leads to errors.
4. A strategy to fix the bug would be to add a condition to check if `_marker_function` is not `None` before trying to execute it.
5. Below is the corrected version of the function considering the issue mentioned in the GitHub post.

### Corrected Version:
```python
class MarkerStyle():
    def _recache(self):
        if self._marker_function is None:
            return
        
        self._path = _empty_path
        self._transform = IdentityTransform()
        self._alt_path = None
        self._alt_transform = None
        self._snap_threshold = None
        self._joinstyle = 'round'
        self._capstyle = 'butt'
        self._filled = True
        
        if self._marker_function:
            self._marker_function()
```

By adding the condition `if self._marker_function is not None:`, the function will first check whether `_marker_function` has a value before trying to execute it. This change will prevent errors related to attempting to call a `None` value as a function.
