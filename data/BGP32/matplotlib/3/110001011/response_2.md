### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_recache` is responsible for re-calculating the marker's properties, such as `_path`, `_transform`, `_alt_path`, `_alt_transform`, `_snap_threshold`, `_joinstyle`, `_capstyle`, and `_filled`. However, the bug occurs when the `_marker_function` is called without checking if it exists.
2. The problem arises when the `_marker_function` is `None` due to which the default attributes are set without initializing the marker's properties correctly.
3. The bug is causing markers to be filled even when `fillstyle='none'` is set as per the GitHub issue's description because the `_marker_function` is incorrectly invoked without a valid check.
4. To fix the bug, we need to first check if `_marker_function` exists before calling it. If it is `None`, we should handle this case appropriately to avoid setting default values.
5. Below is the corrected version of the `_recache` function:

```python
class MarkerStyle():
    def _recache(self):
        if self._marker_function is None:
            return
        
        self._path = _empty_path
        self._transform = IdentityTransform()
        self._alt_path = None
        self._alt_transform = None
        self._snap_threshold = None
        self._joinstyle = 'round'
        self._capstyle = 'butt'
        self._filled = True
        
        # Adding a check for None before calling _marker_function
        if self._marker_function is not None:
            self._marker_function()
``` 

By adding the `if self._marker_function is not None:` check before calling the `_marker_function`, we ensure that the function is only invoked when it exists, preventing unwanted behavior and ensuring correct initialization of marker properties.
