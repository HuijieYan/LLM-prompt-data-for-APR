In the provided buggy function `_recache` of the `MarkerStyle` class, there is an issue where the `_marker_function` is called without checking if it is actually defined. This can lead to unexpected behavior when `self._marker_function` is `None`, causing the function to throw an error or not execute as intended.

#### Cause of the bug:
In the given runtime case, the `_marker_function` is not being checked before calling it. If it is `None`, the function should exit early. The issue reported on GitHub also aligns with this behavior, indicating that markers are not appearing as hollow even when `fillstyle='none'` is set.

#### Strategy for fixing the bug:
1. Check if `self._marker_function` is not `None` before calling it in the `_recache` function.
2. If it is `None`, return without executing the function.

#### Corrected version of the buggy function:
```python
class MarkerStyle:

    def _recache(self):
        if self._marker_function is None:
            return
        
        self._path = _empty_path
        self._transform = IdentityTransform()
        self._alt_path = None
        self._alt_transform = None
        self._snap_threshold = None
        self._joinstyle = 'round'
        self._capstyle = 'butt'
        self._filled = True
        self._marker_function()
```

By adding the conditional check before calling `_marker_function`, the function will only execute if `self._marker_function` is not `None`, resolving the issue reported on GitHub where markers were not appearing as hollow.
