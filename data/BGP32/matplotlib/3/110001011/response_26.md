### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_recache` defines default values for several class attributes but then attempts to call the `_marker_function` method without checking if it exists. This could lead to a potential issue if `_marker_function` is not defined.
2. The GitHub issue indicates a problem with markers not being hollow when `fillstyle='none'` is set. This aligns with the potential issue in the `_recache` method.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is caused by the inconsistent behavior of markers not being hollow as expected when setting `fillstyle='none'` due to the incorrect initialization of marker attributes in the `_recache` method.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
1. Check if the `_marker_function` exists before calling it.
2. Ensure that the correct parameters are set for creating the desired marker style.

### Corrected Version:
```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: lib/matplotlib/markers.py

# The declaration of the class containing the corrected function
class MarkerStyle():
    def _recache(self):
        if self._marker_function is not None:
            self._path = _empty_path
            self._transform = IdentityTransform()
            self._alt_path = None
            self._alt_transform = None
            self._snap_threshold = None
            self._joinstyle = 'round'
            self._capstyle = 'butt'
            self._filled = True
            self._marker_function()
```

By adding the check for `_marker_function` before calling it, the corrected version ensures that the marker style attributes are properly set based on the provided parameters. This fix should address the issue described in the GitHub problem statement.
