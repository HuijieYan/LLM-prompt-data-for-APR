### Analysis:
The buggy function `_recache` in the `markers.py` file seems to be missing a correct definition or implementation for the `_marker_function` attribute. The function tries to call `_marker_function` without checking whether it has been defined or set previously, which could lead to a `NoneType` error or other issues.

### Potential Error Locations:
1. The condition `if self._marker_function is None:` may not accurately handle all cases where `_marker_function` is not defined.
2. Calling `self._marker_function()` without proper initialization or definition could lead to errors.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is caused by attempting to call `_marker_function` without proper initialization or definition, potentially leading to a `NoneType` error or other exceptions.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that `_marker_function` is properly defined or set before calling it in the `_recache` function. Adding a check to validate whether `_marker_function` is callable and not `None` before invoking it will prevent potential errors.

### Corrected Version:
```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: lib/matplotlib/markers.py

# Corrected version of the buggy function
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    if callable(self._marker_function):
        self._path = _empty_path
        self._transform = IdentityTransform()
        self._alt_path = None
        self._alt_transform = None
        self._snap_threshold = None
        self._joinstyle = 'round'
        self._capstyle = 'butt'
        self._filled = True
        self._marker_function()
    else:
        # Handle case when _marker_function is not callable
        pass
```

In the corrected version, we first check if `_marker_function` is `None` to avoid calling it when not defined. Then, we verify if `_marker_function` is callable before invoking it to prevent errors. You can add error handling or logging if needed in case `_marker_function` is not callable.
