### Analysis:
The `_recache` function is supposed to reset several attributes to default values and then call the `_marker_function`. The bug occurs when the `_marker_function` is called without checking if it exists, potentially leading to a `NoneType` object not callable error.

### Identified Error Location:
The potential error location is at `self._marker_function()` where `_marker_function` is called without checking if it is `None`.

### Cause of the Bug:
The bug is caused by calling `_marker_function` directly without checking if it is `None`. If `_marker_function` is `None`, the function will throw an error when trying to call it.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to check if `self._marker_function` is not `None` before calling it. This ensures that the function is only called when it actually exists.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is not None:
        self._path = _empty_path
        self._transform = IdentityTransform()
        self._alt_path = None
        self._alt_transform = None
        self._snap_threshold = None
        self._joinstyle = 'round'
        self._capstyle = 'butt'
        self._filled = True
        self._marker_function()
    else:
        return
``` 

In the corrected version of the `_recache` function, we added a check to ensure that `_marker_function` is not `None` before calling it. This prevents the error that could occur when trying to call a `None` object.
