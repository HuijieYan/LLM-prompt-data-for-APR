## Analysis:
The `_recache` function is meant to reset various attributes to their initial state and call the `_marker_function` if it is not None. The bug in the function lies in the condition `if self._marker_function is None:`, as the function should be called when it is not None, but the current code returns early when it is None, not executing the required logic.

## Error Location:
The issue is in the conditional check `if self._marker_function is None:`. It should be fixed to call `_marker_function` when it is not None.

## Cause of the bug:
The current code conditionally returns early if `_marker_function` is None, skipping the necessary execution when `_marker_function` is actually available. This leads to the function not behaving as intended.

## Strategy to fix the bug:
Modify the condition to check if `_marker_function` is not None and proceed with the attribute resets and function call accordingly.

## Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function:
        self._path = _empty_path
        self._transform = IdentityTransform()
        self._alt_path = None
        self._alt_transform = None
        self._snap_threshold = None
        self._joinstyle = 'round'
        self._capstyle = 'butt'
        self._filled = True
        self._marker_function()
```

In the corrected version, the condition `if self._marker_function:` checks if `_marker_function` is not None, ensuring that the function is called when it exists.
