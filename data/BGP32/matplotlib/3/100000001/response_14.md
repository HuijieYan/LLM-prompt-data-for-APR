### Analysis:
The buggy function `_recache` appears to be a method of a class, as it uses `self` as a parameter. The function sets multiple attributes of the class instance but does not provide any definition or implementation for the `_marker_function`. It attempts to call `_marker_function` without checking if it exists or if it is callable. This could lead to an AttributeError if `_marker_function` is not defined before calling.

### Identified potential error locations:
1. Calling `_marker_function` without checking if it exists.
2. Missing definition or implementation of `_marker_function`.

### Cause of the bug:
The bug in the function `_recache` arises from the assumption that `_marker_function` is always defined and callable, leading to potential AttributeError when it is not. Moreover, there is no implementation shown for `_marker_function`.

### Strategy for fixing the bug:
To fix the bug in the function `_recache`, you can check if `_marker_function` is not None and callable before invoking it. Also, ensure that `_marker_function` is correctly defined and implemented.

### Corrected version of the function:
Here is the corrected version of the `_recache` function:

```python
def _recache(self):
    if callable(self._marker_function):
        self._path = _empty_path
        self._transform = IdentityTransform()
        self._alt_path = None
        self._alt_transform = None
        self._snap_threshold = None
        self._joinstyle = 'round'
        self._capstyle = 'butt'
        self._filled = True
        self._marker_function()
    else:
        # Handle the case where _marker_function is None or not callable
        pass
```

In this corrected version, we added a check to ensure that `_marker_function` is callable before invoking it. You can decide on the appropriate action to take if `_marker_function` is not callable, such as raising an error or setting a default behavior.
