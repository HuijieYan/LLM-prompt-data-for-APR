### Analysis:
The buggy function `_recache` is missing the parameter `self` in its signature, which suggests that this function is part of a class method but has not explicitly defined `self` as its first parameter. This lack of `self` can lead to unexpected behavior since the function won't operate on the instance data correctly.

### Error Location:
The error is in the function signature, where `self` is missing as the first parameter.

### Cause of the Bug:
The absence of `self` as a parameter causes the function to be unaware of the instance it belongs to, leading to incorrect manipulation of instance attributes.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to add `self` as the first parameter in the `_recache` function definition to make it a class method that operates on the instance data correctly.

### Corrected Version:
```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: lib/matplotlib/markers.py

class Marker:
    # Corrected version with self as parameter in_ recache function
    def _recache(self):
        if self._marker_function is None:
            return
        self._path = _empty_path
        self._transform = IdentityTransform()
        self._alt_path = None
        self._alt_transform = None
        self._snap_threshold = None
        self._joinstyle = 'round'
        self._capstyle = 'butt'
        self._filled = True
        self._marker_function()
```

By adding `self` as a parameter in the `_recache` function within the `Marker` class, the function will correctly operate on the instance data and resolve the bug.
