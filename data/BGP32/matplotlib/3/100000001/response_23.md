The bug in the provided function lies in the line `self._marker_function()` where the function is being called without checking if it actually exists. This can cause the program to break if `_marker_function` has not been properly initialized.

To fix this bug, we should add a check to ensure that `_marker_function` exists before calling it. Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: lib/matplotlib/markers.py

# corrected version of the function
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    self._filled = True
    if callable(self._marker_function):
        self._marker_function()
```

In this version, we added an `if callable(self._marker_function):` check before calling `_marker_function()` to ensure that it is a callable object. This will prevent any errors from occurring if `_marker_function` is not properly initialized.
