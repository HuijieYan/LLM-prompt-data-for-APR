## Analysis:
The buggy function `_recache` is meant to reset certain attributes to their initial values and then call the `_marker_function`. However, there is a potential error location in the function that could cause a bug. The `_marker_function` is being called after setting some attributes to their initial values, which may lead to unexpected behavior depending on the implementation of `_marker_function`.

## Bug Cause:
Calling `_marker_function` after resetting attributes means that the function relies on the previous state of the attributes, which could lead to unintended consequences if `_marker_function` expects specific attribute values.

## Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we should first store the `_marker_function` to be called and then reset the attributes to their initial values. By doing so, we ensure that the function operates on the correct state of the attributes.

## Corrected Version:
```python
def _recache(self):
    marker_function = self._marker_function
    if marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    self._filled = True
    marker_function()
```
