### Analysis:
The `_recache` function is intended to reset various attributes of a marker object to default values and then call a marker function. The bug in this function is that it is trying to call `self._marker_function` without checking if it is defined, which can lead to a potential error if `_marker_function` is not set.

### Error Locations:
1. The function attempts to call `self._marker_function` without verifying if it exists.
2. There is no condition to handle the case when `_marker_function` is not defined.

### Cause of the Bug:
The bug occurs because the function blindly tries to call `_marker_function` without confirming its existence, resulting in a potential `AttributeError` if `_marker_function` is not set for the object.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix this bug, we need to add a check to ensure that `_marker_function` is defined before attempting to call it. If `_marker_function` is not set, the function should gracefully handle this scenario without causing an error.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    self._filled = True
    self._marker_function()
```

In the corrected version, we first check if `self._marker_function` is not `None` before attempting to call it. If it is `None`, we simply return from the function without invoking an undefined function. This change ensures that the function is now robust and safe from potential errors due to undefined `_marker_function`.
