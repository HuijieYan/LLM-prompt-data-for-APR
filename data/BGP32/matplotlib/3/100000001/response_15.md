The buggy function `_recache` in the file `lib/matplotlib/markers.py` is missing the correct way of handling the `_marker_function` attribute. The bug arises from calling `self._marker_function()` without checking if it exists or is callable, potentially causing an AttributeError.

To fix this bug, we should check if `self._marker_function` is both not None and callable before invoking it. Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: lib/matplotlib/markers.py

def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is not None and callable(self._marker_function):
        self._path = _empty_path
        self._transform = IdentityTransform()
        self._alt_path = None
        self._alt_transform = None
        self._snap_threshold = None
        self._joinstyle = 'round'
        self._capstyle = 'butt'
        self._filled = True
        self._marker_function()
```

Now, the function first checks if `_marker_function` is not None and if it is callable before executing it. This modification ensures that the function is only called if it exists and can be invoked, preventing potential AttributeError or other errors.
