### Analysis:
The `_recache` function is meant to reset certain attributes to default values and then call the `_marker_function`. However, there is a bug in this function where it directly calls `_marker_function` without checking if it is initialized or not leading to a potential error.

### Potential Error Location:
The potential error is at the line `self._marker_function()` where it directly calls `_marker_function` without validating if it exists or not.

### Cause of the Bug:
The bug is caused by not checking if `_marker_function` is initialized before calling it, which can lead to a `NoneType` error if `_marker_function` is not set.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix this bug, we can add a check to ensure that `_marker_function` is not `None` before calling it.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is not None:
        self._path = _empty_path
        self._transform = IdentityTransform()
        self._alt_path = None
        self._alt_transform = None
        self._snap_threshold = None
        self._joinstyle = 'round'
        self._capstyle = 'butt'
        self._filled = True
        self._marker_function()
```

In the corrected version, we added a check `if self._marker_function is not None:` before calling `_marker_function` to avoid potential errors. This ensures that `_marker_function` is only called when it is initialized.
