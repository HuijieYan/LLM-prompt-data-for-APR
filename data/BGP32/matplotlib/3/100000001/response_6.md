### Analysis:
The `self._marker_function` is being called without checking if it is a valid function or not. This can lead to potential errors if `self._marker_function` is not defined properly.

### Error Location:
The potential error is in the line `self._marker_function()` where it is called without validation.

### Cause of the Bug:
The bug is caused by calling `self._marker_function()` without verifying if `self._marker_function` is a valid function. If `self._marker_function` is not defined properly, it can raise an error.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to check if `self._marker_function` is a valid function before calling it. If it is not defined properly, handle it gracefully without raising an error.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None or not callable(self._marker_function):
        return
        
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    self._filled = True
    self._marker_function()
```

In the corrected version, we have added a check `if self._marker_function is None or not callable(self._marker_function):` before calling `self._marker_function()`. This ensures that the function is callable and avoids potential errors if `self._marker_function` is not defined properly.
