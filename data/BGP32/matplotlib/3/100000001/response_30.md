## Analysis:
The buggy function `_recache` is intended to reinitialize certain attributes to default values if the attribute `_marker_function` is not None. However, the function seems to have an issue because there is no definition or assignment of `_marker_function`, so calling it at the end of the function will result in an error.

## Identified Potential Error Location:
The main cause of the bug lies in the function trying to call `_marker_function` without having it defined or set to a specific function.

## Cause of Bug:
The bug occurs due to the function trying to invoke `_marker_function` without any prior assignment or definition. This leads to an undefined function call, resulting in an error.

## Suggested Fix Strategy:
To fix this bug, we need to either define `_marker_function` within the class or modify the logic to handle the absence of a marker function more gracefully.

## Corrected Version:
```python
# The corrected version of the buggy function
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is not None:
        self._path = _empty_path
        self._transform = IdentityTransform()
        self._alt_path = None
        self._alt_transform = None
        self._snap_threshold = None
        self._joinstyle = 'round'
        self._capstyle = 'butt'
        self._filled = True
        if callable(self._marker_function):  # Check if _marker_function is callable
            self._marker_function()
```

In the corrected version, the function first checks if `_marker_function` is not None before proceeding to reinitialize attributes and calling `_marker_function`. Additionally, it verifies whether `_marker_function` is callable using the `callable` function to prevent errors.
