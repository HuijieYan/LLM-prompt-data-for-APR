## Analysis:
The buggy function `_recache` is missing the `self` parameter in its definition. This function is likely intended to be a method of a class but currently lacks the necessary reference to the instance itself (`self`). This absence of `self` reference can lead to errors when trying to access instance attributes or methods within the function.

## Error Locations:
1. The absence of the `self` parameter in the `_recache` function.
2. Potential issues accessing instance variables and methods without `self`.

## Cause of the Bug:
The bug arises due to the missing `self` parameter in the `_recache` function. Without `self`, the function does not have access to the instance attributes and methods, leading to potential errors or unexpected behavior.

## Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
1. Add the `self` parameter to the `_recache` function to make it a method of a class.
2. Update the function to access instance attributes and methods using `self`.
3. Ensure that the function operates correctly within the context of the class to which it belongs.

## Corrected Version:
```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: lib/matplotlib/markers.py

# corrected version of the function
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    self._filled = True
    self._marker_function()
```

In the corrected version, the `self` parameter is added to the `_recache` function, allowing it to be a method of a class and access instance attributes and methods as intended. This fix addresses the bug and ensures the function operates correctly within the class context.
