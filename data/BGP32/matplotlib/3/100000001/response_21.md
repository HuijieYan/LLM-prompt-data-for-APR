### Analysis:
The buggy function `_recache` is supposed to reset certain attributes of an object related to markers in a matplotlib library. The function is checking if `_marker_function` is not None, and if it's not None, it should reset certain attributes and call `_marker_function`.

### Potential error locations:
1. The condition `if self._marker_function is None:` should be `if self._marker_function is not None:` because we want to execute the code block if `_marker_function` is not None.
2. It seems like `_marker_function` is a method that should belong to the object itself, but the function does not take any arguments to know which object should call `_marker_function` on.

### Cause of the bug:
The bug in the current function is that it checks if `_marker_function` is None and, if it's not None, calls it without any reference to the object itself. Therefore, the function `_marker_function` will not behave as expected as it lacks context.

### Fix strategy:
1. Change the condition to `if self._marker_function is not None:` to correctly check if the function exists.
2. Add a reference to the object associated with the `_marker_function` method so that it can be called correctly.

### Corrected version:
```python
# The corrected version of the function
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is not None:
        self._path = _empty_path
        self._transform = IdentityTransform()
        self._alt_path = None
        self._alt_transform = None
        self._snap_threshold = None
        self._joinstyle = 'round'
        self._capstyle = 'butt'
        self._filled = True
        self._marker_function(self)
```

In the corrected version, we fixed the condition and added the object reference `self` as an argument to the `_marker_function` call.
