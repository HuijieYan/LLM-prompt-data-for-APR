## Analyzing the buggy function:
The function `_recache` is intended to reset certain attributes to their default values and call a marker function if it is not None. However, there is a potential bug in this function related to the way the `self._marker_function()` is called.

## Potential error locations:
1. The condition `if self._marker_function is None:` might be incorrect. It should be comparing against the function object, not just the function name.
2. The function is called without checking if it is a callable object, which might lead to unexpected behavior.

## Cause of the bug:
The bug occurs because the function does not properly check if `self._marker_function` is callable before attempting to call it. This can lead to errors if `self._marker_function` is not a function or if it is not defined.

## Strategy for fixing the bug:
To fix the bug, we should verify that `self._marker_function` is callable before attempting to call it. We should also check if it is not None.

## Corrected version of the function:
```python
def _recache(self):
    if callable(self._marker_function):
        self._path = _empty_path
        self._transform = IdentityTransform()
        self._alt_path = None
        self._alt_transform = None
        self._snap_threshold = None
        self._joinstyle = 'round'
        self._capstyle = 'butt'
        self._filled = True
        self._marker_function()
``` 

By adding the `callable(self._marker_function)` check, we ensure that we only call `self._marker_function` if it is a callable object. This correction should prevent errors that may arise from trying to call a non-callable object.
