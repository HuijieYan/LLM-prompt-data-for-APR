The buggy function `_recache` is designed to reset certain attributes of an object to their default values. However, the bug lies in the line `self._marker_function()` where it tries to call a method without checking if it exists, which can potentially lead to an AttributeError.

To fix this bug, we need to add a check to ensure that `self._marker_function` is callable before attempting to call it. Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None or not callable(self._marker_function):
        return
    
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    self._filled = True
    self._marker_function()
```

By adding the check `not callable(self._marker_function)`, we ensure that the `_marker_function` attribute exists and is callable before trying to execute it. This prevents the AttributeError from occurring.
