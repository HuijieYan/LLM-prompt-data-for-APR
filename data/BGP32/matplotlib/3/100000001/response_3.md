The bug in the provided function is that it is calling a marker function without checking if it exists. This could lead to a `NameError` if the `_marker_function` is not defined.

To fix this bug, we need to check if the `_marker_function` exists before calling it. Here is a corrected version of the function:

```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    self._filled = True
    if callable(self._marker_function):
        self._marker_function()
```

In the corrected version, we added a check using `callable()` to ensure that `_marker_function` is a callable object before attempting to call it. This prevents potential `NameError` by only executing the function if it is defined.
