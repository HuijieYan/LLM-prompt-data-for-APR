### Analysis:
1. The function `_recache` is supposed to reset certain attributes and then call a marker function.
2. The bug occurs when calling `_marker_function` without checking if it exists, which can lead to a `NoneType` object not callable error.

### Bug Location:
The bug is located at `self._marker_function()` call without checking if `self._marker_function` is `None`.

### Cause of the Bug:
The bug occurs because the function is calling `_marker_function` without verifying its existence, leading to a `NoneType` object not callable error.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
We need to add a condition to check if `self._marker_function` is not `None` before calling it to avoid the `NoneType` error.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is not None:
        self._path = _empty_path
        self._transform = IdentityTransform()
        self._alt_path = None
        self._alt_transform = None
        self._snap_threshold = None
        self._joinstyle = 'round'
        self._capstyle = 'butt'
        self._filled = True
        self._marker_function()
    else:
        pass
``` 

By adding the condition `if self._marker_function is not None`, we ensure that `_marker_function` is only called if it exists, avoiding the error and fixing the bug.
