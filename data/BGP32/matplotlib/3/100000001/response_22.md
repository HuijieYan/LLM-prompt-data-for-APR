## Analysis:
The buggy function `_recache()` is missing the `self` parameter in its declaration. It seems like a method inside a class but for some reason, the `self` parameter is not explicitly specified.

## Identified potential error location:
The `self` parameter is commonly used in Python class methods to refer to the instance of the class. In this case, without `self`, the method is unable to access the class instance attributes.

## Explanation of the bug:
The bug is caused by missing the `self` parameter in the method `_recache()`. As a result, when the method tries to access instance variables like `_marker_function`, it fails because it does not have access to the instance variables without the `self` reference.

## Strategy for fixing the bug:
Add the `self` parameter to the `_recache()` method declaration so that it can access the instance variables correctly.

## Corrected Version:
```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: lib/matplotlib/markers.py

# corrected function
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    self._filled = True
    self._marker_function()
``` 

By adding the `self` parameter to the `_recache()` method, the corrected version ensures that the method can access the instance variables of the class properly.
