### Analysis:
The given function `_recache()` is supposed to reinitialize certain attributes of an object, but it seems to have a bug where it is trying to call a `_marker_function` without checking if it exists. This can lead to an AttributeError if `_marker_function` is not defined.

### Error Location:
The potential error is the line `self._marker_function()` where it directly calls the `_marker_function` without checking if it is defined or not.

### Cause of the Bug:
The bug arises from assuming that `_marker_function` will always be defined before calling it. If the function is not set or defined, it will raise an AttributeError.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we can add a check to ensure that `_marker_function` exists before calling it. This will prevent the AttributeError and provide more robustness to the function.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    self._filled = True
    if callable(self._marker_function):
        self._marker_function()
```

In the corrected version, we added an additional check `if callable(self._marker_function):` before calling `_marker_function()`. This check ensures that `_marker_function` is callable before it is invoked, preventing potential AttributeError.
