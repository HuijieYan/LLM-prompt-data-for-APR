## Analysis:
The buggy function `_recache` in the `markers.py` file is supposed to reset various attributes of the marker object to default values before calling the `marker_function`. However, there is a bug in the function where it tries to call `self._marker_function` directly without checking if it exists or not. This would result in an AttributeError if `_marker_function` is not defined.

## Error Location:
The error is in the line `self._marker_function()` where it directly attempts to call the `_marker_function` without checking if it is defined.

## Cause of the Bug:
The cause of the bug is that the function is trying to call `_marker_function` without verifying if it is assigned a value or not. This results in an AttributeError since it may not exist in certain cases.

## Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, a check should be added to ensure that `_marker_function` is not `None` before attempting to call it.

## Corrected Version:
```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    self._filled = True
    self._marker_function()
```

By adding the condition `if self._marker_function is not None`, we can prevent the AttributeError and ensure that the function is called only when it exists.
