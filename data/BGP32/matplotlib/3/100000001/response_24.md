### Analysis:
The `_recache` function aims to reset certain attributes to default values and then call the `_marker_function`. The bug arises from calling `_marker_function` without checking if it exists or not.

### Potential Error:
- The bug could be due to calling `self._marker_function()` without ensuring its existence, leading to a `NoneType` error if `_marker_function` is not defined.

### Cause of the Bug:
The bug arises because the code does not check whether `_marker_function` is defined or not before calling it. If `_marker_function` is None, calling it will result in an error.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
Before calling `_marker_function`, it is essential to verify if it is defined. If it is not defined, the function should return or handle the situation appropriately without running the undefined function.

### Corrected Version:

```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    self._filled = True
    self._marker_function()
``` 

In the corrected version, the function first checks if `_marker_function` is None before attempting to call it. This check ensures that the function is only called if it is defined, thus preventing any errors related to calling an undefined function. This fix addresses the bug and ensures the function operates correctly.
