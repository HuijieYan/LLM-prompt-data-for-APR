## Analysis:
The buggy function `_recache` is supposed to reset various attributes to default values and then call the `_marker_function`. The potential error location is with the line `self._marker_function()`. If the `_marker_function` is not defined correctly or is missing, this will cause an error.

## Bug Cause:
The bug occurs because the function attempts to call `self._marker_function` without ensuring that it is defined or initialized. If `_marker_function` is not properly defined or set, this will raise an AttributeError.

## Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that `_marker_function` is properly defined or initialized before calling it in the `_recache` function.

## Corrected Version:
```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: lib/matplotlib/markers.py

# corrected version of the function
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    self._filled = True
    if callable(self._marker_function):
        self._marker_function()
``` 

This corrected version includes a check to ensure that `_marker_function` is callable before attempting to call it. This prevents the AttributeError that could occur if `_marker_function` is not properly defined.
