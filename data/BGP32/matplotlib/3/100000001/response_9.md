## Analysis:
The `_recache` function is intended to reset certain attributes to default values and then call a marker function. However, the code contains a potential issue in the line `self._marker_function()` where it calls the marker function directly without any checks. If `_marker_function` is None, it will raise an error.

## Bug Cause:
The bug is caused by calling `self._marker_function()` without checking if it is None, which leads to a potential `NoneType` error.

## Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to add a check to ensure that `_marker_function` is not None before calling it.

## Corrected Version:
```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is not None:
        self._path = _empty_path
        self._transform = IdentityTransform()
        self._alt_path = None
        self._alt_transform = None
        self._snap_threshold = None
        self._joinstyle = 'round'
        self._capstyle = 'butt'
        self._filled = True
        self._marker_function()
    else:
        pass
```
