The buggy function `_recache` is missing the `self` parameter, indicating that it should be a method of a class. This method seems to belong to a class that deals with markers in Matplotlib.

The potential error in this buggy function lies in the `_marker_function()` call at the end. If `_marker_function` is not set or defined correctly, calling it will result in a `TypeError`.

To fix this bug, one strategy is to ensure that `_marker_function` is properly defined and set within the class. Additionally, we should update the function definition to include the `self` parameter, making it a class method.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: lib/matplotlib/markers.py

class MarkerClass:
    def __init__(self):
        self._path = None
        self._transform = None
        self._alt_path = None
        self._alt_transform = None
        self._snap_threshold = None
        self._joinstyle = 'round'
        self._capstyle = 'butt'
        self._filled = True
        self._marker_function = None

    def _recache(self):
        if self._marker_function is None:
            return
        self._path = _empty_path
        self._transform = IdentityTransform()
        self._alt_path = None
        self._alt_transform = None
        self._snap_threshold = None
        self._joinstyle = 'round'
        self._capstyle = 'butt'
        self._filled = True
        self._marker_function()
```

In this corrected version, I assumed that the `_empty_path` variable is defined elsewhere in the module. Also, the class `MarkerClass` is defined to encapsulate the functionality related to markers, and the method `_recache` now has the `self` parameter as it should be called on an instance of the class.
