### Analysis:
The `_recache` function is intended to reset the marker properties to default values and then call the `_marker_function`. The bug in the function lies in the condition `if self._marker_function is None:`. It should be checking if `self._marker_function` is callable instead of comparing it to `None`.

### Error Location:
The condition `if self._marker_function is None:` is incorrect and causing the bug.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is caused by checking if `self._marker_function` is `None`, which will not execute the intended behavior of calling the function. This comparison does not check if `_marker_function` is a callable function, leading to the function not being executed.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, the condition should be modified to check if `self._marker_function` is callable. This will ensure that the function is called when `_marker_function` is a valid function.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def _recache(self):
    if not callable(self._marker_function):
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    self._filled = True
    self._marker_function()
```

In the corrected version, the `if` condition now checks if `self._marker_function` is callable using the `callable()` function. If it is callable, the function `_marker_function` will be executed, ensuring that the intended behavior is achieved.
