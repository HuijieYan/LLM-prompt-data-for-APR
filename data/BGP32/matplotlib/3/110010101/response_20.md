### Analysis
The buggy function `_recache` in the `MarkerStyle` class is supposed to reset several attributes to default values and then call the `_marker_function`. However, in the failing test case, it is expected that `marker_style.is_filled()` should return `False`, but it is currently returning `True`. This suggests that the `_filled` attribute is not being set to `False` within the `_recache` function as expected.

### Bug
The bug lies in the assignment of the `_filled` attribute within the `_recache` function. It is currently being set to `True` unconditionally, instead of setting it based on the `fillstyle` attribute of the `MarkerStyle` object.

### Fix
To fix the bug, we need to update the `_recache` function to set the `_filled` attribute based on the value of the `fillstyle` attribute. If the `fillstyle` is `'none'`, then `_filled` should be set to `False`, otherwise, it should be set to `True`.

### Corrected Version
```python
class MarkerStyle():
    def _recache(self):
        if self._marker_function is None:
            return
        self._path = _empty_path
        self._transform = IdentityTransform()
        self._alt_path = None
        self._alt_transform = None
        self._snap_threshold = None
        self._joinstyle = 'round'
        self._capstyle = 'butt'
        
        # Set filled based on fillstyle
        self._filled = self._fillstyle != 'none'
        
        self._marker_function()
``` 

With this correction, the `_filled` attribute will be set correctly based on the `fillstyle` attribute, and the failing test that checks for `marker_style.is_filled()` to be `False` should pass successfully.
