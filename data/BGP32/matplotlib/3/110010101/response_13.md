## Analysis
1. The `MarkerStyle` class has a method `_recache` that resets certain attributes of the class instance.
2. The bug occurs when the `_marker_function` attribute is not `None`, triggering a function call that is not intended to be called in this context.
3. The error message shows that the `is_filled` method is returning `True` when it should return `False`.
4. To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the `_marker_function` is not called if it exists.
5. We should update the `_recache` method to include a check for `_marker_function` before calling it.

## Solution
```python
class MarkerStyle():
    def _recache(self):
        if self._marker_function is not None:  # Check if marker function exists
            self._marker_function()  # Call marker function if it exists
        else:
            self._path = _empty_path
            self._transform = IdentityTransform()
            self._alt_path = None
            self._alt_transform = None
            self._snap_threshold = float('inf')
            self._joinstyle = 'round'
            self._capstyle = 'butt'
            self._filled = False
```

By adding a check before calling `_marker_function`, we ensure that it is only called when intended. This change should fix the bug and make the failing test pass.
