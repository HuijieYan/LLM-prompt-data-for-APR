## Analysis
The buggy function `_recache` in the `MarkerStyle` class is intended to reset certain attributes to default values and then call the `_marker_function`. The issue lies in the implementation of resetting the `_filled` attribute to `True` unconditionally, regardless of the initial value.

## Bug
The bug occurs when the `_filled` attribute is always set to `True` inside the `_recache` function, causing the `is_filled` method to return `True` even when it should return `False`. This leads to the failing test where the assertion `assert not marker_style.is_filled()` fails.

## Fix
To fix the bug, we need to store the initial value of the `_filled` attribute before resetting it. Then, we can restore the original value after the reset process.

## The corrected version of the function
```python
class MarkerStyle():
    def _recache(self):
        if self._marker_function is None:
            return
        
        # Store the initial value of _filled
        initial_filled = self._filled
        
        self._path = _empty_path
        self._transform = IdentityTransform()
        self._alt_path = None
        self._alt_transform = None
        self._snap_threshold = None
        self._joinstyle = 'round'
        self._capstyle = 'butt'
        
        # Restore the initial value of _filled
        self._filled = initial_filled
        
        self._marker_function()
```
