## Analysis
The buggy function `_recache` is failing when the `is_filled()` method is called on `MarkerStyle` object. The error message indicates that the method is returning `True` when it should return `False`. The bug seems to be related to the incorrect initialization of the `_filled` attribute in the `_recache` function.

## Bug Explanation
The `_filled` attribute in the `_recache` function is initialized to `True`, while it should actually be initialized based on the `fillstyle` attribute of the `MarkerStyle` object. Since the `_filled` attribute is not updated based on the `fillstyle`, the `is_filled()` method always returns `True` as it just checks the value of the `_filled` attribute.

## Fix Strategy
To fix this bug, we need to update the initialization of the `_filled` attribute in the `_recache` function to reflect the actual `fillstyle` attribute of the `MarkerStyle` object. This can be achieved by setting `_filled` to `False` when the `fillstyle` is `'none'`. 

## The corrected version of the buggy function
```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: lib/matplotlib/markers.py

# The declaration of the class containing the buggy function
class MarkerStyle():
    # this is the corrected function
    def _recache(self):
        if self._marker_function is None:
            return
        self._path = _empty_path
        self._transform = IdentityTransform()
        self._alt_path = None
        self._alt_transform = None
        self._snap_threshold = None
        self._joinstyle = 'round'
        self._capstyle = 'butt'
        self._filled = False if self._fillstyle == 'none' else True
        self._marker_function()
```

By updating the initialization of the `_filled` attribute based on the `fillstyle` attribute, the corrected version of the function should pass the failing test and satisfy the expected input/output values.
