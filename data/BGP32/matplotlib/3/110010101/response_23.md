## Analysis
The buggy function `_recache` in the `MarkerStyle` class is supposed to reset certain attributes to default values and then call the `_marker_function`. However, the issue arises when it tries to check if `_marker_function` is `None` before calling it. This causes the function to return without executing the expected behavior, leading to the failing test case.

## Bug Cause
1. The buggy function checks if `_marker_function` is equal to `None`, but then proceeds to call it by invoking `self._marker_function()`.
2. Since the buggy function does not raise an AttributeError when `_marker_function` is `None`, it continues executing the `_marker_function` method, causing the failing test.

## Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to add a conditional check to ensure that `_marker_function` is not `None` before trying to call it. If `_marker_function` is `None`, we should simply return without executing anything further.

## The corrected version of the function
```python
class MarkerStyle():
    
    def _recache(self):
        if self._marker_function is None:
            return
        self._path = _empty_path
        self._transform = IdentityTransform()
        self._alt_path = None
        self._alt_transform = None
        self._snap_threshold = None
        self._joinstyle = 'round'
        self._capstyle = 'butt'
        self._filled = True
        if self._marker_function:
            self._marker_function()
```

By adding the conditional `if self._marker_function`, the corrected function will now properly check if `_marker_function` is not `None` before calling it. This fix should prevent the failing test case encountered earlier.
