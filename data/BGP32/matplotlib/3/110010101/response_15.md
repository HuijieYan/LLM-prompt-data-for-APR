## Analysis
1. The buggy function `_recache` within the `MarkerStyle` class is supposed to recache certain attributes based on the `_marker_function`. The issue arises when the `_marker_function` is called without checking if it exists or is not `None`.
2. The error message indicates that the method `is_filled` is returning `True` when it should be returning `False`, suggesting that the `_filled` attribute is not being set correctly within the `_recache` function.
3. The bug in the code is caused by the premature call to `_marker_function` without handling the case where it is `None`. This leads to incorrect attribute assignments, resulting in the `is_filled` method returning the wrong value.
4. To fix the bug, we need to add a check before calling `_marker_function` and properly initialize the `_filled` attribute based on the provided `fillstyle` in the `MarkerStyle` initializer.
5. Below is the corrected version of the `_recache` function:

```python
class MarkerStyle():
    
    def _recache(self):
        if self._marker_function is None:
            return
        self._path = _empty_path
        self._transform = IdentityTransform()
        self._alt_path = None
        self._alt_transform = None
        self._snap_threshold = None
        self._joinstyle = 'round'
        self._capstyle = 'butt'
        
        if self._fillstyle == 'full':
            self._filled = True
        elif self._fillstyle == 'none':
            self._filled = False
        else:
            # For other fillstyles, assume filled
            self._filled = True
        
        self._marker_function()
```

By updating the `_recache` function as shown above, we ensure that the `_filled` attribute is correctly set based on the `fillstyle` provided during initialization. This fix should resolve the issue and make the `is_filled` method return the expected value.
