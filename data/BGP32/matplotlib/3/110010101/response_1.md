### Analysis
The buggy function `_recache` is part of the `MarkerStyle` class in the `markers.py` file of the `matplotlib` library. The function is supposed to update certain attributes of the `MarkerStyle` instance based on its current state, including calling a `_marker_function` method. 

The failing test is checking whether the method `is_filled()` returns `False` after calling `_recache()`. However, the current implementation always sets `_filled` to `True` at the end of the function, which causes the test to fail.

### Bug Cause
The bug in the current implementation is that `_filled` is set to `True` unconditionally at the end of `_recache()`, regardless of other settings. This overrides any potential setting based on the marker style, leading to incorrect behavior in the failing test.

### Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the `_filled` attribute is correctly updated based on the marker styling parameters. We should modify the function so that it considers the `self._fillstyle` attribute before setting `_filled`.

### Corrected Version
```python
class MarkerStyle():

    def _recache(self):
        if self._marker_function is None:
            return
        self._path = _empty_path
        self._transform = IdentityTransform()
        self._alt_path = None
        self._alt_transform = None
        self._snap_threshold = None
        self._joinstyle = 'round'
        self._capstyle = 'butt'
        self._filled = self._fillstyle != 'none'
        self._marker_function()
``` 

By checking the `self._fillstyle` attribute and setting `_filled` accordingly, the corrected version ensures that the `is_filled()` method behaves correctly according to the marker style.
