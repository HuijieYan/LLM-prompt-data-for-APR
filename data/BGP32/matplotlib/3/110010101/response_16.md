### Analysis
The buggy function `_recache` in the `MarkerStyle` class is supposed to reset some internal state variables and call a marker function. However, there is a bug in the function as it calls `self._marker_function()` without checking if it is defined or not before calling it. This results in an error when trying to execute `marker_style.is_filled()` because `self._marker_function` is not properly set.

### Bug
The bug in the function is that it directly calls `self._marker_function()` without checking if it is defined or not. This causes the AttributeError when trying to access `marker_style.is_filled()`.

### Fix
To fix the bug, we need to add a check to ensure `self._marker_function` is not None before calling it.

### Corrected Version
```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: lib/matplotlib/markers.py

# The declaration of the class containing the corrected function
class MarkerStyle():
    def _recache(self):
        if self._marker_function is None:
            return
        self._path = _empty_path
        self._transform = IdentityTransform()
        self._alt_path = None
        self._alt_transform = None
        self._snap_threshold = None
        self._joinstyle = 'round'
        self._capstyle = 'butt'
        self._filled = True
        self._marker_function()
```

By adding the check `if self._marker_function is None: return`, we ensure that the `_marker_function` is only called if it is defined, preventing the AttributeError from occurring. This corrected version should pass the failing test and satisfy the expected input/output values.
