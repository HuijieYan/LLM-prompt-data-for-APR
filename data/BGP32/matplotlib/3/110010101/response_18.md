## Analysis
The buggy function `_recache` is intended to reset certain attributes of the `MarkerStyle` instance to default values. However, there is a bug in the function where it attempts to call `self._marker_function()` without considering the case when `self._marker_function` is `None`. This results in an error when trying to call a `None` object.

## Bug Explanation
In the failing test case, the `MarkerStyle` object is created with `fillstyle='none'`, which sets `self._fillstyle` to `'none'`. The test then expects that `marker_style.is_filled()` should return `False` because the fill style is `'none'`.

However, the bug in `_recache` causes an issue when calling `self._marker_function()` without checking if it exists or not. This leads to an error which causes the test to fail.

## Bug Fix Strategy
To fix this bug, we need to add a check before calling `self._marker_function()` to ensure that it is not `None`. If it is `None`, then just return without attempting to execute it.

## The corrected version of the function
```python
class MarkerStyle():
    
    def _recache(self):
        if self._marker_function is None:
            return
        self._path = _empty_path
        self._transform = IdentityTransform()
        self._alt_path = None
        self._alt_transform = None
        self._snap_threshold = np.inf  # Assuming np.inf is used for infinity
        self._joinstyle = 'round'
        self._capstyle = 'butt'
        self._filled = False if self.get_fillstyle() == 'none' else True  # Check fillstyle for filled attribute
        self._marker_function()
``` 

This corrected version includes the necessary check for `self._marker_function` before invoking it, ensuring that it will not be called when it is `None`. Additionally, it properly sets the `self._filled` attribute based on the fill style value.
