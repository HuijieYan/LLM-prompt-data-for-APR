## Analysis
The buggy function `_recache` in the `MarkerStyle` class is failing because the `is_filled` method is returning `True` instead of the expected `False`. This is likely due to the `_filled` attribute not being set correctly in the function.

## Bug Explanation
In the `_recache` function, the `_filled` attribute is incorrectly set to `True` instead of setting it to `False`. This causes the `is_filled` method to return `True` when it should return `False`.

## Bug Fix
To fix the bug, we need to update the `_filled` attribute to `False` in the `_recache` function.

## The corrected version of the function

```python
class MarkerStyle():

    def _recache(self):
        if self._marker_function is None:
            return
        self._path = _empty_path
        self._transform = IdentityTransform()
        self._alt_path = None
        self._alt_transform = None
        self._snap_threshold = None
        self._joinstyle = 'round'
        self._capstyle = 'butt'
        self._filled = False  # Change _filled to False
        self._marker_function()
``` 

By making this change, the `_filled` attribute will be set to `False` as expected, and the failing test case should pass.
