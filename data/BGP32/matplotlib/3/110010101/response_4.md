### Analysis
The buggy function `_recache` is part of the `MarkerStyle` class. The function is intended to reset certain attributes to default values and then call the `_marker_function`. The error occurs because the `_marker_function` is being called directly without checking if it is `None`.

### Bug Location
The bug occurs in the line where `_marker_function` is called unconditionally.

### Cause of the Bug
The bug happens because the `_marker_function` is only called if it is not `None`. In this case, it seems to be `None`, resulting in an error when trying to call a `NoneType` object.

### Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to check if `_marker_function` is not `None` before calling it. This will ensure that the function is only called if it is assigned a valid function.

### Corrected Code
```python
class MarkerStyle():
    def _recache(self):
        if self._marker_function is not None:
            self._path = _empty_path
            self._transform = IdentityTransform()
            self._alt_path = None
            self._alt_transform = None
            self._snap_threshold = None
            self._joinstyle = 'round'
            self._capstyle = 'butt'
            self._filled = True
            self._marker_function()
``` 

Now, the corrected version of the `_recache` function includes a check to ensure that `_marker_function` is not `None` before calling it. This fix should prevent the error observed in the failing test.
