### Code Analysis
The buggy function `_recache` in the `MarkerStyle` class is supposed to initialize various attributes to default values and then call the `_marker_function`. 
The failing test indicates that the `is_filled` method is returning `True` when it should actually return `False`, meaning that the `_filled` attribute is not being set correctly in the `_recache` function.

### Bug Explanation
The bug in the `_recache` function is that it sets `_filled` to `True` unconditionally, which contradicts the expected behavior based on the failing test. This causes the `is_filled` method to return `True` when it should actually return `False`.

### Bug Fix Strategy
We need to modify the `_recache` function to set the `_filled` attribute based on the value of `self._fillstyle`. If `self._fillstyle` is `'none'`, then `_filled` should be set to `False`.

### Corrected Version

```python
class MarkerStyle():

    def _recache(self):
        if self._marker_function is None:
            return
        self._path = _empty_path
        self._transform = IdentityTransform()
        self._alt_path = None
        self._alt_transform = None
        self._snap_threshold = float('inf')
        self._joinstyle = 'round'
        self._capstyle = 'butt'
        
        # Check if fillstyle is 'none' to determine if marker should be filled
        if self._fillstyle == 'none':
            self._filled = False
        else:
            self._filled = True
        
        self._marker_function()
```

By checking the value of `self._fillstyle` and setting `_filled` accordingly in the `_recache` function, we ensure that the `is_filled` method returns the correct value based on the fillstyle specified.
