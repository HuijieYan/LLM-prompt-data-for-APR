### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_recache` in the `MarkerStyle` class is causing an assertion error in the test case related to checking if the marker is filled.
2. The function initializes some variables including `_filled` to `True`, which is causing the bug as it contradicts the expected value in the failing test case.
3. The bug is caused because the `_filled` attribute is set to `True` by default in the `_recache` function, but the failing test case expects it to be `False`. This contradiction leads to the assertion error.
4. To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the `_filled` attribute is set according to the expected value in the failing test case.

### Bug Fix:
```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: lib/matplotlib/markers.py

from .transforms import IdentityTransform, Affine2D

class MarkerStyle():
    def _recache(self):
        if self._marker_function is None:
            return
        self._path = _empty_path
        self._transform = IdentityTransform()
        self._alt_path = None
        self._alt_transform = None
        self._snap_threshold = float('inf')  # Set snap threshold to infinity
        self._joinstyle = 'round'
        self._capstyle = 'butt'
        # Set filled attribute based on fillstyle
        if self._fillstyle and self._fillstyle != 'none':
            self._filled = True
        else:
            self._filled = False
        self._marker_function()
```

By adjusting the `_filled` attribute based on the fillstyle, the corrected function should now pass the failing test case and satisfy the expected input/output values.
