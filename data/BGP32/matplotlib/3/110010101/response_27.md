## Analysis
1. The buggy function `_recache` is contained within the `MarkerStyle` class.
2. The function is supposed to reset certain attributes of the `MarkerStyle` instance.
3. The failing test indicates that the `is_filled` method is returning `True`, which contradicts the expectation in the test.
4. The bug seems to be related to the incorrect initialization of the `_filled` attribute in the `_recache` function.

## Bug in the code
The bug seems to be in the line:
```python
self._filled = True
```
This line sets `_filled` to `True` unconditionally, which is incorrect given that the `fillstyle` parameter passed during object creation can make `_filled` `False`.

## Fixing the bug
To fix the bug, we should set `_filled` based on the value of `_fillstyle` parameter. If `_fillstyle` is 'none', `_filled` should be `False`. Otherwise, `_filled` should be `True`.

Here is the corrected version of the `_recache` function:

```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    self._filled = self._fillstyle.lower() != 'none'
    self._marker_function()
```

This fix will ensure that `_filled` is set correctly based on the value of `_fillstyle`.
