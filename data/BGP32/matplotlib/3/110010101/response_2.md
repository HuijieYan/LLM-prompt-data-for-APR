## Analysis
The buggy function `_recache` in the `MarkerStyle` class is supposed to reinitialize the attributes of the class instance. However, there is a bug where it tries to call a method `self._marker_function()` unconditionally without checking its existence. This can lead to errors such as the one observed in the failing test.

### Bug in the code
The bug in the code is calling `self._marker_function()` without checking if it exists. This causes the AssertionError in the failing test due to an unfulfilled expectation on the `is_filled` method.

### Fixing Strategy
To fix the bug, we should check if `self._marker_function` is not `None` before calling it. If it is `None`, we will skip that call to avoid the error.

### The corrected version of the code
```python
class MarkerStyle:

    def _recache(self):
        if self._marker_function is not None:
            self._path = _empty_path
            self._transform = IdentityTransform()
            self._alt_path = None
            self._alt_transform = None
            self._snap_threshold = None
            self._joinstyle = 'round'
            self._capstyle = 'butt'
            self._filled = True
            self._marker_function()
``` 

After implementing this fix, the `MarkerStyle` class should now function correctly without causing the error observed in the failing test.
