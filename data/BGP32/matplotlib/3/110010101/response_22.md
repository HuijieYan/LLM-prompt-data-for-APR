## Analysis
The buggy function `_recache` in the `MarkerStyle` class is supposed to reset certain attributes to default values when the `_marker_function` is None. However, the issue arises when `self._filled` is mistakenly set to `True` instead of `False`, which goes against the expected behavior.

## Bug Cause
The bug occurs because the `_filled` attribute is always set to `True` regardless of the condition in the `_recache` function. This causes the failing test `assert not marker_style.is_filled()` to fail because `is_filled()` returns `True` instead of `False`.

## Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the `_filled` attribute is set to `False` when the `_marker_function` is None.

## The corrected version of the function

```python
class MarkerStyle():

    def _recache(self):
        if self._marker_function is None:
            self._filled = False  # Set filled to False when marker function is None
            return
        self._path = _empty_path
        self._transform = IdentityTransform()
        self._alt_path = None
        self._alt_transform = None
        self._snap_threshold = None
        self._joinstyle = 'round'
        self._capstyle = 'butt'
        self._filled = True
        self._marker_function()
```

By setting `self._filled = False` when the `_marker_function` is None, we ensure that the behavior aligns with the expected output, and the failing test should now pass.
