## Analysis
The buggy function `_recache` in the `MarkerStyle` class is not correctly setting the `_filled` attribute based on the `_fillstyle` attribute. This causes the `is_filled` method to return `True` when it should return `False` in the failing test case.

## Bug Explanation
In the buggy function, the `_filled` attribute is always set to `True` regardless of the `_fillstyle` attribute value. This leads to incorrect behavior when checking if the marker is filled through the `is_filled` method.

## Bug Fix
To fix the bug, we need to correctly set the `_filled` attribute based on the `_fillstyle` attribute value. We can use a conditional statement to handle the different `_fillstyle` values and adjust the `_filled` attribute accordingly.

## The corrected version of the function
```python
    def _recache(self):
        if self._marker_function is None:
            return
        self._path = _empty_path
        self._transform = IdentityTransform()
        self._alt_path = None
        self._alt_transform = None
        self._snap_threshold = None
        self._joinstyle = 'round'
        self._capstyle = 'butt'
        if self._fillstyle == 'none':
            self._filled = False
        else:
            self._filled = True
        self._marker_function()
``` 

By adding the conditional statement to adjust the `_filled` attribute based on the `_fillstyle` value, the corrected function should now pass the failing test case and behave as expected.
