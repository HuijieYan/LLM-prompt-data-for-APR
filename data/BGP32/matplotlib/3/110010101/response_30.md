## Analysis
1. The buggy function `_recache` in the `MarkerStyle` class is supposed to reset certain attributes to default values when the `_marker_function` is not None.
2. The failing test is trying to assert that `marker_style.is_filled()` should return `False`, but it is currently returning `True`.
3. The bug is likely caused by not updating the `_filled` attribute correctly in the `_recache` function, leading to the incorrect return value.
4. To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the `_filled` attribute is set to `False` when `_recache` is called.

## Fix
```python
class MarkerStyle():
    def _recache(self):
        if self._marker_function is None:
            return
        self._path = _empty_path
        self._transform = IdentityTransform()
        self._alt_path = None
        self._alt_transform = None
        self._snap_threshold = None
        self._joinstyle = 'round'
        self._capstyle = 'butt'
        self._filled = False  # Fix: Set _filled attribute to False
        self._marker_function()
```

By updating the `_filled` attribute to `False` in the `_recache` function, the corrected version should now pass the failing test and behave as expected.
