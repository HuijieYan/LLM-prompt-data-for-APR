### Analysis
1. The `MarkerStyle` class is missing the appropriate imports which should have been provided in the initial environment. 
2. The `_recache` function initializes various attributes of the `MarkerStyle` instance, but the buggy part is related to the `self._filled` attribute.
3. The failing test is checking whether `is_filled()` returns `False`, but the `_filled` attribute is initialized to `True` in the `_recache` function.
4. To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the `_filled` attribute is set to `False` initially.

### Fix
We need to modify the initialization of the `_filled` attribute in the `_recache` function to set it to `False` instead of `True`. This will ensure that the marker is not filled by default.

### Corrected Version
```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: lib/matplotlib/markers.py

# The declaration of the class containing the corrected function
class MarkerStyle():

    # The corrected version of the buggy function
    def _recache(self):
        if self._marker_function is None:
            return
        self._path = _empty_path
        self._transform = IdentityTransform()
        self._alt_path = None
        self._alt_transform = None
        self._snap_threshold = None
        self._joinstyle = 'round'
        self._capstyle = 'butt'
        self._filled = False  # Fix: Set _filled to False initially
        self._marker_function()
```

By setting the `_filled` attribute to `False` in the `_recache` function, the corrected version should now pass the failing test and satisfy the expected input/output values.
