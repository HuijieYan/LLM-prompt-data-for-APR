To fix the bug in the `_recache` function, we need to modify the `self._filled` variable based on the value of `self._fillstyle`. If `self._fillstyle` is `'none'`, we should set `self._filled` to `False` to make the marker hollow. 

Here is the corrected version of the `_recache` function:

```python
class MarkerStyle():
    def _recache(self):
        if self._marker_function is None:
            return
        self._path = _empty_path
        self._transform = IdentityTransform()
        self._alt_path = None
        self._alt_transform = None
        self._snap_threshold = None
        self._joinstyle = 'round'
        self._capstyle = 'butt'
        
        # Check the value of fillstyle to determine if the marker should be filled
        if self._fillstyle == 'none':
            self._filled = False
        else:
            self._filled = True
        
        self._marker_function()
```

With this modification, the `is_filled()` method should now correctly reflect the fillstyle set for the marker, allowing the failing test to pass. This change ensures that when `fillstyle` is set to `'none'`, the marker will be hollow.

Make sure to test the corrected version with the failing test case provided to verify that the issue has been resolved.
