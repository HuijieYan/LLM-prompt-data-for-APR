The bug in the `_recache()` function is that it is setting `self._filled = True` unconditionally, even when `fillstyle` is set to 'none'. This results in the markers not being hollow as expected.

To fix this bug, we need to update the `_recache()` function to correctly handle the `fillstyle` parameter. If `fillstyle` is set to 'none', then `self._filled` should be set to `False` to ensure that the markers are hollow.

Here is the corrected version of the `_recache()` function:

```python
# Corrected version of the _recache() function
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    # Update _filled based on fillstyle
    if self._fillstyle in ['none', 'none']:
        self._filled = False
    else:
        self._filled = True
    self._marker_function()
```

With this correction, the `self._filled` attribute will be set based on the `fillstyle` parameter, and the markers will correctly appear hollow when `fillstyle` is set to 'none'.

This fix addresses the reported issue in the GitHub post and ensures that markers will be rendered as hollow when using `markers.MarkerStyle` with `fillstyle='none'`.
