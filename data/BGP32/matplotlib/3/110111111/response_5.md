## Analysis
1. The buggy function `_recache` in the `MarkerStyle` class is supposed to update certain attributes of the `MarkerStyle` instance based on the `_marker_function`. However, it is not correctly updating the `self._filled` attribute, leading to failing test cases.
   
2. The failing test is checking if the marker is filled or not after setting the `fillstyle` to `'none'`, which should result in a not filled marker. This failing test indicates that the `_filled` attribute is not being updated as expected.
   
## Bug Cause
The bug is caused by not updating the `_filled` attribute correctly within the `_recache` function. The `_marker_function` may not be setting the value of `_filled` as intended.

## Strategy for Fixing the Bug
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the `_filled` attribute is updated according to the fillstyle set in the `MarkerStyle`. We can directly update `_filled` based on the `fillstyle` parameter.

## The corrected version of the buggy function
```python
class MarkerStyle:

    def _recache(self):
        if self._marker_function is not None:
            self._path = _empty_path
            self._transform = Affine2D()
            self._alt_path = None
            self._alt_transform = None
            self._snap_threshold = None
            self._joinstyle = 'round'
            self._capstyle = 'butt'
            self._filled = self._fillstyle != 'none'
            self._marker_function()
```

In the corrected version, we set the `_filled` attribute based on whether the `fillstyle` is not `'none'`. This change ensures that the `_filled` attribute is correctly updated according to the `fillstyle` parameter set when creating the `MarkerStyle`.
