To fix the bug in the `_recache` method of the `MarkerStyle` class, we need to update the assignment of the `_filled` attribute based on the value of the `fillstyle` attribute. Here is a corrected version of the `_recache` method:

```python
class MarkerStyle():
    def _recache(self):
        if self._marker_function is None:
            return
        self._path = _empty_path
        self._transform = IdentityTransform()
        self._alt_path = None
        self._alt_transform = None
        self._snap_threshold = None
        self._joinstyle = 'round'
        self._capstyle = 'butt'
        self._filled = self._fillstyle != 'none'
        self._marker_function()
```

Explanation:
- The bug was that the `_filled` attribute was always set to `True` in the original code, regardless of the `fillstyle` value.
- In the corrected code, `_filled` is set to `True` if `fillstyle` is not `'none'`, and set to `False` if `fillstyle` is `'none'`.
- This change ensures that the `_filled` attribute is correctly determined based on the `fillstyle` parameter.

By making this correction, the `MarkerStyle` class will now correctly handle the `fillstyle` parameter and behave as expected, resolving the failing test and the GitHub issue mentioned.
