## Identified Bug in the Buggy Function

The bug in the `_recache` function of the `MarkerStyle` class is that it always sets `_filled` to `True`, regardless of the `fillstyle` parameter provided. This leads to incorrect behavior when `fillstyle='none'` is used, as seen in the failing test.

## Bug Fix Strategy

To fix this bug, we need to update the `_filled` attribute based on the `fillstyle` parameter that is passed during the creation of the `MarkerStyle` instance. If `fillstyle='none'`, we should set `_filled` to `False`.

## Corrected Function of MarkerStyle

```python
# The declaration of the class containing the corrected function
class MarkerStyle():

    # The corrected `_recache` function
    def _recache(self):
        if self._marker_function is None:
            return
        self._path = _empty_path
        self._transform = IdentityTransform()
        self._alt_path = None
        self._alt_transform = None
        self._snap_threshold = None
        self._joinstyle = 'round'
        self._capstyle = 'butt'
        self._filled = self.get_fillstyle() != 'none'
        self._marker_function()
    
    def get_fillstyle(self):
        return self._fillstyle
```

By updating the `_recache` function to set `_filled` based on the `fillstyle` parameter, we ensure that the marker is correctly filled or not filled as intended by the user. This correction resolves the issue seen in the failing test and aligns with the expected behavior based on the provided input and the GitHub issue described.
