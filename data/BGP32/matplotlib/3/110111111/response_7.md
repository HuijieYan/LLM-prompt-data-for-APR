## Analyzing the buggy function

The `MarkerStyle` class's `_recache` function is meant to recalculate the attributes of the marker style. The bug occurs when the function sets the `_filled` attribute to `True` unconditionally, regardless of whether the `marker_function` is called or not. This results in the markers always being filled, even if `fillstyle='none'` is explicitly set.

### Error Location
The bug is located in the line:
```python
self._filled = True
```
This line sets the `_filled` attribute to `True`, which conflicts with the intention of setting the markers to be hollow when `fillstyle='none'`.

### Cause of the Bug
The failing test case expects the marker to not be filled (`is_filled()` returns `False`). However, due to the unconditional setting of `_filled` to `True` in the `_recache` function, the expected behavior is not achieved. This leads to the assertion error in the test.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug
To fix the bug, the `_filled` attribute should depend on the value returned from calling the `marker_function`. If the `marker_function` is called and sets the marker's attributes accordingly, the `_filled` attribute should reflect whether the marker is intended to be filled or not.

### Updated Corrected Version
Here is the corrected version of the `_recache` function in the `MarkerStyle` class:

```python
class MarkerStyle():
    def _recache(self):
        if self._marker_function is None:
            return
        self._path = _empty_path
        self._transform = IdentityTransform()
        self._alt_path = None
        self._alt_transform = None
        self._snap_threshold = None
        self._joinstyle = 'round'
        self._capstyle = 'butt'
        self._filled = self._marker_function() is not None
```

This fix ensures that the `_filled` attribute is set based on the return value of the `marker_function`, allowing markers to be properly filled or hollow based on the `fillstyle` parameter.
