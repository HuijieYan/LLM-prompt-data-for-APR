## Proposed Solution

### Explanation
The issue lies in the `_recache` method of the `MarkerStyle` class. The method sets the `_filled` attribute to `True` unconditionally at the end, which contradicts the expected behavior when `fillstyle` is set to `'none'`. This results in the marker not being hollow as expected.

### Proposed Fix
To resolve this issue, we need to modify the `_recache` method to consider the `fillstyle` parameter provided when creating the `MarkerStyle` object. If `fillstyle` is set to `'none'`, then `_filled` should be set to `False` to correctly represent a hollow marker.

### Corrected Version
Here is the corrected version of the `_recache` method:

```python
# The corrected version of the buggy file: lib/matplotlib/markers.py

class MarkerStyle():
    def _recache(self):
        if self._marker_function is None:
            return
        self._path = _empty_path
        self._transform = IdentityTransform()
        self._alt_path = None
        self._alt_transform = None
        self._snap_threshold = None
        self._joinstyle = 'round'
        self._capstyle = 'butt'
        self._filled = False if self._fillstyle == 'none' else True
        self._marker_function()
```

With this correction, the `_filled` attribute will reflect the intended behavior based on the `fillstyle` parameter, allowing markers to be hollow when desired.

After implementing this fix, the failing test `test_marker_fillstyle` should pass as expected.
