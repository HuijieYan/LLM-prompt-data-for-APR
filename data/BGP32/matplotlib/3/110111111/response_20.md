Based on the provided information, the issue lies within the `MarkerStyle` class's `_recache` method. The `_filled` attribute is always being set to `True` at the end of the method, regardless of the actual specified fill style. This is causing the failing test `test_marker_fillstyle` to assert that the marker is filled even when it should not be.

To fix this bug, we need to update the `_filled` attribute based on the specified fill style. If the fill style is `'none'`, then `_filled` should be set to `False`.

Here is the corrected version of the `_recache` method in the `MarkerStyle` class:

```python
class MarkerStyle():

    # Corrected version of the _recache method
    def _recache(self):
        if self._marker_function is None:
            return
        self._path = _empty_path
        self._transform = IdentityTransform()
        self._alt_path = None
        self._alt_transform = None
        self._snap_threshold = None
        self._joinstyle = 'round'
        self._capstyle = 'butt'
        
        # Updating _filled based on fill style
        if self._fillstyle == 'none':
            self._filled = False
        else:
            self._filled = True
        
        self._marker_function()
```

With this correction, the `MarkerStyle` class now correctly handles the fill style parameter, ensuring that markers are either filled or hollow based on the specified fill style. This change should resolve the failing test and satisfy the expected input/output values.

By updating the `_filled` attribute based on the fill style, the bug causing markers not to be hollow when setting `fillstyle='none'` should be fixed.
