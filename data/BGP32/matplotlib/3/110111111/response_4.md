To fix the bug in the `_recache` function of the `MarkerStyle` class, we need to adjust the `self._filled` attribute based on the `fillstyle` parameter provided during initialization. If the `fillstyle` is set to `'none'`, then `self._filled` should be set to `False` to indicate that the marker should be hollow.

Here is the corrected version of the `_recache` function:

```python
class MarkerStyle():
    def _recache(self):
        if self._marker_function is None:
            return
        self._path = _empty_path
        self._transform = IdentityTransform()
        self._alt_path = None
        self._alt_transform = None
        self._snap_threshold = None
        self._joinstyle = 'round'
        self._capstyle = 'butt'
        
        if self.get_fillstyle() == 'none':
            self._filled = False
        else:
            self._filled = True
        
        self._marker_function()
```

By adding the conditional check to set `self._filled` based on the `fillstyle` parameter, the `MarkerStyle` object will now correctly handle the case when a hollow marker is desired.

This fixed version of the `_recache` function should make the failing test pass as expected, satisfying the requirements of the GitHub issue mentioned earlier.

This fix ensures that when `fillstyle='none'` is passed, the marker will be hollow, addressing the specific issue reported in the GitHub problem statement.
