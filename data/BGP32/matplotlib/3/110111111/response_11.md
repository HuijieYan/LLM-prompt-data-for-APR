## Analysis
1. The buggy function `_recache` in the `MarkerStyle` class initializes various attributes such as `_path`, `_transform`, etc., and then calls the `_marker_function()` method. The issue arises when the `_marker_function` is not `None`, but the expected behavior is to set `_filled` attribute to `False` when `fillstyle='none'`.
2. The failing test `test_marker_fillstyle` creates a `MarkerStyle` object with `fillstyle='none'` and asserts that `is_filled()` should return `False`, but the `_filled` attribute remains `True`.
3. The failing test error message indicates that the `_filled` attribute does not change to `False`, leading to the failed assertion.
4. The bug can be fixed by setting `_filled` to `False` when the `fillstyle` is set to `'none'` before calling the `_marker_function()`.
5. The corrected version of the function will include setting `_filled` to `False` based on the `fillstyle` parameter.

## Corrected Version
```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: lib/matplotlib/markers.py

# The declaration of the class containing the corrected function
class MarkerStyle():

    # The corrected function
    def _recache(self):
        if self._marker_function is None:
            return

        if self._fillstyle == 'none':
            self._filled = False

        self._path = _empty_path
        self._transform = IdentityTransform()
        self._alt_path = None
        self._alt_transform = None
        self._snap_threshold = None
        self._joinstyle = 'round'
        self._capstyle = 'butt'
        self._marker_function()
```

After making the above changes, the `MarkerStyle` class should now correctly handle the `fillstyle='none'` case, setting `_filled` to `False` as expected. This correction should resolve the issue reported on GitHub and make the failing test pass successfully.
