Based on the provided information, the bug in the `_recache` function of the `MarkerStyle` class is that it always sets the `_filled` attribute to `True` at the end of the function, regardless of the intended fill style specified by the user. This results in markers not being hollow when `fillstyle='none'`, as the expected behavior is for `_filled` to be `False` in that case.

To fix this bug, we need to adjust the `_filled` attribute based on the specified `fillstyle`. Here is the corrected version of the `_recache` function:

```python
class MarkerStyle():

    def _recache(self):
        if self._marker_function is None:
            return
        self._path = _empty_path
        self._transform = IdentityTransform()
        self._alt_path = None
        self._alt_transform = None
        self._snap_threshold = None
        self._joinstyle = 'round'
        self._capstyle = 'butt'
        self._filled = self.get_fillstyle() != 'none'
        self._marker_function()
```

By updating the `_filled` attribute to be based on the `fillstyle`, the markers will be correctly rendered as hollow when the fillstyle is set to `'none'`. This correction aligns with the expected behavior specified in the failing test.

After applying this fix, the `MarkerStyle` class should behave as expected, and the failing test for `marker_style.is_filled()` should pass successfully.
