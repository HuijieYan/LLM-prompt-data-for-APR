## Fixing the buggy function

### Bug analysis:
The `_recache` function is intended to recalculate certain attributes of the `MarkerStyle` class when needed. However, based on the provided code, it seems that the `_marker_function` attribute is being called without checking if it is actually defined. This could lead to an error if `_marker_function` is not set before calling `_recache`.

### Bug cause:
The bug is caused by calling `_marker_function` without checking if it is `None`, potentially leading to a `TypeError` if `_marker_function` is not defined.

### Strategy for fixing the bug:
To fix the bug, we need to check if `_marker_function` is not `None` before calling it in the `_recache` function. This way, we ensure that the function is only called when it is defined.

### Corrected version of the function:
```python
class MarkerStyle():
    def _recache(self):
        if self._marker_function is not None:
            self._path = _empty_path
            self._transform = IdentityTransform()
            self._alt_path = None
            self._alt_transform = None
            self._snap_threshold = None
            self._joinstyle = 'round'
            self._capstyle = 'butt'
            self._filled = True
            self._marker_function()
```

After implementing this change, the `_recache` function will only call `_marker_function` if it is not `None`, avoiding any potential errors related to undefined functions.
