## Analysis
The buggy function `_recache` in the `MarkerStyle` class is supposed to update certain attributes of the class instance based on the values set by other methods. However, there is a logical error where the `_marker_function` is called without checking or ensuring that it exists or is necessary.

## Bug Explanation
In the failing test `test_marker_fillstyle()`, it creates an instance of `MarkerStyle` with `fillstyle='none'`. The buggy function `_recache` doesn't take this `fillstyle` into account and directly calls `_marker_function` without any validation. This can lead to unexpected behavior and failure in the test case.

## Bug Fix Strategy
1. Check if `_marker_function` is not `None` before calling it.
2. Update the `self._filled` attribute based on the value of `self._fillstyle`.

## The corrected version of the function
```python
class MarkerStyle():
    def _recache(self):
        if self._marker_function is None:
            return
        
        self._path = _empty_path
        self._transform = IdentityTransform()
        self._alt_path = None
        self._alt_transform = None
        self._snap_threshold = None
        self._joinstyle = 'round'
        self._capstyle = 'butt'
        
        if self._fillstyle in ['full', 'both']:
            self._filled = True
        elif self._fillstyle == 'none':
            self._filled = False
        
        self._marker_function()
```

By incorporating the logic to set the `self._filled` attribute based on the `self._fillstyle` value and ensuring that `_marker_function` is not `None` before calling it, the corrected version should pass the failing test case and provide the expected outcomes.
