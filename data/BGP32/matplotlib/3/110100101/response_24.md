## Analysis
The `_recache` function in the `MarkerStyle` class is supposed to update certain attributes based on the current marker function. However, the code is not correctly handling the case where the `self._marker_function` is `None`. This results in the function not updating any attributes.

## Bug Explanation
The bug occurs because the function directly calls `self._marker_function()` without checking if it is `None` or not. This causes an AttributeError since the `None` object has no attribute to call as a function. As a result, none of the attributes are updated, leading to incorrect behavior.

## Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to add a condition to check if `self._marker_function` is not `None` before calling it. If it is `None`, we can simply return from the function without attempting to update any attributes. This ensures that the function behaves correctly even if the marker function is not provided.

## The Corrected Version
```python
class MarkerStyle():
    def _recache(self):
        if self._marker_function is None:
            return
        self._path = _empty_path
        self._transform = IdentityTransform()
        self._alt_path = None
        self._alt_transform = None
        self._snap_threshold = None
        self._joinstyle = 'round'
        self._capstyle = 'butt'
        self._filled = True
        self._marker_function()
```
