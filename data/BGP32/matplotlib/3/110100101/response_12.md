## Analysis
The buggy function `_recache` in the `MarkerStyle` class seems to have a logic issue where it tries to call a `_marker_function` without checking if it is defined. This results in an error if `_marker_function` is not set.

## Bug Explanation
The bug occurs because the `_recache` function blindly tries to call `self._marker_function()` without checking if it is set. This causes an AttributeError if `_marker_function` is not defined.

## Bug Fix
To fix the bug, we need to add a check to see if `self._marker_function` is not `None` before trying to call it.

## The corrected version of the function
```python
class MarkerStyle:
    def _recache(self):
        if self._marker_function is not None:
            self._path = _empty_path
            self._transform = IdentityTransform()
            self._alt_path = None
            self._alt_transform = None
            self._snap_threshold = None
            self._joinstyle = 'round'
            self._capstyle = 'butt'
            self._filled = True
            self._marker_function()
```
