## Analysis
1. The `_recache` function initializes several attributes of the `MarkerStyle` class, such as `_path`, `_transform`, `_snap_threshold`, `_joinstyle`, `_capstyle`, and `_filled`, based on the value of `_marker_function`.
2. The bug lies in the `_marker_function` being called without any checks, which can lead to unexpected behavior.
3. In the failing test, the `MarkerStyle` is instantiated with `fillstyle='none'`, but since `_marker_function` is called without considering the `fillstyle`, the attributes may not be correctly initialized.
   
## Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the behavior of the `_recache` function aligns with the expected initialization based on the provided input parameters. Here's the corrected version of the `_recache` function:

```python
# The corrected version of the function
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    
    if self._fillstyle == 'none':
        self._filled = False
    else:
        self._filled = True

    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = float('inf')
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'

    self._marker_function()
```

By explicitly checking the `fillstyle` and setting `_filled` accordingly, the function now correctly initializes the attributes based on the input parameters.

This corrected version should pass the failing test as it ensures that the `MarkerStyle` is correctly configured based on the fill style provided.
