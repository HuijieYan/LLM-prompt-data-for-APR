The issue in the `_recache` function is that it is calling `self._marker_function()` without assigning its return value or using it in any way. This can lead to unexpected behavior as the `self._marker_function()` might modify the class attributes unintentionally.

To fix this issue, we can remove the `self._marker_function()` call and ensure that the function handles all the attribute assignments internally.

Here is the corrected version of the `_recache` function:

```python
class MarkerStyle():
    def _recache(self):
        if self._marker_function is None:
            return
        self._path = _empty_path
        self._transform = IdentityTransform()
        self._alt_path = None
        self._alt_transform = None
        self._snap_threshold = float('inf')
        self._joinstyle = 'round'
        self._capstyle = 'butt'
        self._filled = False
```

With this correction, the function should now correctly initialize the class attributes without invoking any external functions that could potentially introduce unintended side effects.
