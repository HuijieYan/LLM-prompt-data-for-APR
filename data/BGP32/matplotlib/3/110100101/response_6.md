There are several issues in the provided code snippet:
1. The `_marker_function` attribute is being called without checking if it exists, which can lead to errors.
2. The expected value of `self._filled` in the second test case is `False`, but the function sets it to `True`.

To fix these issues, we need to modify the `_recache` function as follows:

```python
class MarkerStyle():
    def _recache(self):
        if self._marker_function is None:
            return
        self._path = _empty_path
        self._transform = IdentityTransform()
        self._alt_path = None
        self._alt_transform = None
        self._snap_threshold = float('inf')
        self._joinstyle = 'round'
        self._capstyle = 'butt'
        self._filled = self._fillstyle != 'none'
        if self._marker_function:
            self._marker_function()
```

This corrected version checks if `_marker_function` is not None before calling it and correctly sets the `_filled` attribute based on the value of `_fillstyle`.

With these changes, the function should now pass the failing test case provided.
