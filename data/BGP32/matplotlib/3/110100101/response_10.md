The bug in the `_recache` function is that it is trying to call `self._marker_function` without checking if it is defined or not, which leads to a `TypeError` when `self._marker_function` is `None`. To fix this issue, we need to check if `self._marker_function` is not `None` before calling it.

Here's a corrected version of the `_recache` function:

```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: lib/matplotlib/markers.py

class MarkerStyle():

    def _recache(self):
        if self._marker_function is not None:
            self._path = _empty_path
            self._transform = IdentityTransform()
            self._alt_path = None
            self._alt_transform = None
            self._snap_threshold = float('inf')
            self._joinstyle = 'round'
            self._capstyle = 'butt'
            self._filled = False
            self._marker_function()
```

By adding the check `if self._marker_function is not None:` before calling `self._marker_function()`, we ensure that the function is only called when it is defined. This should fix the bug and make the function pass the failing test.
