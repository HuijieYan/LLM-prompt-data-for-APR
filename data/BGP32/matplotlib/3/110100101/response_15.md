## Bug Explanation
The bug in the `_recache` function is that it is trying to call `self._marker_function()` without checking if `_marker_function` is actually a callable object. This can lead to an error if `_marker_function` is not defined or is `None`.

## Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to add a check to see if `_marker_function` is not `None` before trying to call it. This check will prevent the function from attempting to call a non-existent or invalid function.

## The corrected version of the buggy function
```python
class MarkerStyle():

    def _recache(self):
        if self._marker_function is not None and callable(self._marker_function):
            self._path = _empty_path
            self._transform = IdentityTransform()
            self._alt_path = None
            self._alt_transform = None
            self._snap_threshold = None
            self._joinstyle = 'round'
            self._capstyle = 'butt'
            self._filled = True
            self._marker_function()
``` 

By adding the `if self._marker_function is not None and callable(self._marker_function):` check before calling `_marker_function()`, we ensure that the function is only called if it exists and is callable. This fix prevents potential errors related to calling a non-existent function.
