## Fixing the buggy function

### Analysis:
The `_recache` function in the `MarkerStyle` class initializes several attributes to default values and calls the `_marker_function` if it is not None. The issue is that it should check if `_marker_function` is a callable object before invoking it.

### Bug Cause:
The bug occurs because the function directly calls `_marker_function` without checking if it is a valid callable object. This can lead to errors if `_marker_function` is not defined or is not callable.

### Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we should check if `_marker_function` is callable before invoking it. If it is not callable, we can simply skip calling it. 

### Corrected Version:

```python
# The corrected version of the buggy function
class MarkerStyle():
    def _recache(self):
        if self._marker_function is None or not callable(self._marker_function):
            return
        
        self._path = _empty_path
        self._transform = IdentityTransform()
        self._alt_path = None
        self._alt_transform = None
        self._snap_threshold = np.inf
        self._joinstyle = 'round'
        self._capstyle = 'butt'
        self._filled = False
        self._marker_function()
``` 

By adding the check `not callable(self._marker_function)` before invoking `_marker_function`, we ensure that it is a valid callable object. This corrected version should pass the failing test and maintain the expected input/output values.
