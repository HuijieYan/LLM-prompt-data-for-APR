The bug in the `_recache` function is that it is trying to call a marker function (`self._marker_function`) without checking if it exists. This causes an AttributeError when the `marker_function` is `None`.

To fix this bug, we need to add a check to ensure that `self._marker_function` is not `None` before calling it. If it is `None`, we can simply return from the function without executing any further code.

Here is the corrected version of the `_recache` function:

```python
class MarkerStyle():

    def _recache(self):
        if self._marker_function is None:
            return
        
        self._path = _empty_path
        self._transform = IdentityTransform()
        self._alt_path = None
        self._alt_transform = None
        self._snap_threshold = float('inf')
        self._joinstyle = 'round'
        self._capstyle = 'butt'
        self._filled = False
        self._marker_function()
```

With this change, the function will now correctly check for the existence of `_marker_function` before invoking it, preventing the AttributeError. The rest of the function remains the same as before.
