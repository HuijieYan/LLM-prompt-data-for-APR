The bug in the `_recache` function is that it is trying to call `self._marker_function()` without checking if `_marker_function` exists. This can cause an AttributeError if `_marker_function` is not defined.

To fix this bug, we need to check if `_marker_function` exists before calling it. If it does not exist, we can simply return from the function.

Here is the corrected version of the `_recache` function:

```python
class MarkerStyle():
    def _recache(self):
        if self._marker_function is None:
            return
        self._path = _empty_path
        self._transform = IdentityTransform()
        self._alt_path = None
        self._alt_transform = None
        self._snap_threshold = None
        self._joinstyle = 'round'
        self._capstyle = 'butt'
        self._filled = True
        self._marker_function()
```

This corrected version checks if `_marker_function` exists before calling it, preventing any AttributeError from occurring. This should now pass the failing test case provided.
