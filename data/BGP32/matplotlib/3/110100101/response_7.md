## Analysis
The buggy function `_recache` in the `MarkerStyle` class is supposed to recache the marker style attributes, but the bug lies in the line `self._marker_function()`, where it attempts to call a function stored in the `_marker_function` attribute without checking if it is actually set.

## Bug Explanation
The bug occurs because the `_marker_function` attribute is not properly handled before being called. If `_marker_function` is None, it will cause an error when trying to call it, leading to the function failing.

## Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to check if `_marker_function` is not None before calling it. If it is None, then we should skip calling it to avoid an error.

## The corrected version of the buggy function
```python
class MarkerStyle():

    def _recache(self):
        if self._marker_function is None:
            return
        self._path = _empty_path
        self._transform = IdentityTransform()
        self._alt_path = None
        self._alt_transform = None
        self._snap_threshold = None
        self._joinstyle = 'round'
        self._capstyle = 'butt'
        self._filled = True
        
        self._marker_function()  # Call _marker_function only if it is not None
``` 

By adding a check for `self._marker_function is None` before calling it, the corrected function will prevent the error and pass the failing test.
