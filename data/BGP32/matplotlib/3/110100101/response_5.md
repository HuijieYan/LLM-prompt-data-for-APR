## Analysis
1. The `_recache` function in the `MarkerStyle` class is supposed to reset the state of the MarkerStyle instance by setting various attributes to default values. It then calls the `_marker_function` to update the marker style.
2. The bug lies in the fact that the `_marker_function` is called without checking if it exists or not, which can lead to errors if it is not defined.
3. In the failing test `test_marker_fillstyle`, an instance of `MarkerStyle` is created with `fillstyle='none'`, and the `is_filled` method is expected to return `False`. However, since the `_marker_function` is called without validation, it can lead to unexpected behavior.
4. To fix the bug, we need to add a check to ensure that `_marker_function` exists before calling it.

## Proposed Fix
```python
class MarkerStyle():

    def _recache(self):
        if self._marker_function is None:
            return
        self._path = _empty_path
        self._transform = IdentityTransform()
        self._alt_path = None
        self._alt_transform = None
        self._snap_threshold = float('inf')  # assuming inf represents infinity
        self._joinstyle = 'round'
        self._capstyle = 'butt'
        self._filled = False  # setting filled to false as default
        self._marker_function()
```

By adding the check `if self._marker_function is None:` before calling it, we ensure that the function is only executed if it is defined. This fix should prevent errors and ensure the correct behavior of the `MarkerStyle` class.
