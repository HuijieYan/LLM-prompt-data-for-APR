## Fixing the bug in the _recache function:

### Analysis:
The _recache function is supposed to update certain attributes of the MarkerStyle instance based on the current marker function. There seems to be an issue with how the function is handling the attributes and calling the marker function.

### Identified Bug:
The buggy function is trying to call self._marker_function() without checking if it exists. This can lead to an AttributeError if _marker_function is not defined.

### Bug Cause:
The bug occurs because the function does not have proper error handling to check if _marker_function is defined before calling it. This can result in the function failing when it tries to call an undefined function.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
1. Add a check to ensure that self._marker_function is not None before calling it.
2. Implement the necessary logic to handle cases where _marker_function may not be defined.

### Corrected Version of the _recache function:
```python
class MarkerStyle():

    def _recache(self):
        if self._marker_function is None:
            return
        self._path = _empty_path
        self._transform = IdentityTransform()
        self._alt_path = None
        self._alt_transform = None
        self._snap_threshold = float('inf')
        self._joinstyle = 'round'
        self._capstyle = 'butt'
        self._filled = False
        if callable(self._marker_function):
            self._marker_function()
```

By adding a check to ensure that self._marker_function is not None before calling it, we can prevent the AttributeError from occurring. Additionally, setting _filled to False if _marker_function is not callable ensures that the attribute is correctly updated based on the function's behavior.
