## Analysis
The `MarkerStyle` class has a `_recache` method that is intended to reset several attributes to their initial values. However, the bug occurs when attempting to call `self._marker_function()` without checking if it exists. This leads to an error if `self._marker_function` is `None`.

## Bug Explanation
In the buggy function `_recache`, there is no check to verify if `self._marker_function` is not equal to `None` before calling it. This results in an error if `self._marker_function` is `None`, as it is called without being defined. This causes the test to fail due to an unexpected error occurring during the function execution.

## Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to add a condition to check if `self._marker_function` is not equal to `None` before calling it. If it is `None`, we can skip the function call and proceed with resetting the other attributes as intended.

## The Corrected Version
```python
class MarkerStyle():
    def _recache(self):
        if self._marker_function is None:
            return
        self._path = _empty_path
        self._transform = IdentityTransform()
        self._alt_path = None
        self._alt_transform = None
        self._snap_threshold = None
        self._joinstyle = 'round'
        self._capstyle = 'butt'
        self._filled = True
        self._marker_function()
```

With this fix, the `_recache` method will only call `self._marker_function` if it is not `None`, preventing any errors from occurring. This corrected version should pass the failing test provided.
