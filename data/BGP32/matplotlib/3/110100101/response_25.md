## The buggy function analysis
The `_recache` function in the `MarkerStyle` class initializes several attributes to default values and then calls a marker function. The bug lies in setting `_filled` to `True` regardless of the input parameters.

### Error Location
The bug is located at the line:
```python
self._filled = True
```

### Cause of the Bug
The bug occurs because the `_filled` attribute is set to `True` unconditionally in the `_recache` function, which contradicts the expected behavior when the `fillstyle` parameter is set to `'none'`.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to update the `_filled` attribute based on the value of the `fillstyle` parameter. If the `fillstyle` is 'none', then `_filled` should be set to `False`, indicating that the marker shape is not filled.

### The corrected version of the function:

```python
class MarkerStyle():

    def _recache(self):
        if self._marker_function is None:
            return
        self._path = _empty_path
        self._transform = IdentityTransform()
        self._alt_path = None
        self._alt_transform = None
        self._snap_threshold = None
        self._joinstyle = 'round'
        self._capstyle = 'butt'
        self._filled = self._fillstyle != 'none'
        self._marker_function()
```

Now, the `_filled` attribute is set based on the `fillstyle` parameter, ensuring that it reflects whether the marker shape should be filled or not. This correction aligns with the expected behavior defined in the failing test.
