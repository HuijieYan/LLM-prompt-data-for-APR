## Analysis
The buggy function `_recache` in the `MarkerStyle` class is supposed to reinitialize certain attributes based on the `_marker_function` attribute. However, there is an issue in the function where it sets `self._filled` to `True` unconditionally, which contradicts the `fillstyle='none'` setting.

## Bug Explanation
The bug causes the `is_filled()` method to return `True` even when the `fillstyle='none'`. This indicates that the `fillstyle` setting is not honored in the current implementation of the `_recache` function.

## Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the `_filled` attribute is set according to the `fillstyle` parameter. If the `fillstyle` is set to `'none'`, then `_filled` should be set to `False`. Otherwise, it should be set to `True`.

## The corrected version of the function
```python
#The corrected version of the buggy function
    def _recache(self):
        if self._marker_function is None:
            return
        self._path = _empty_path
        self._transform = IdentityTransform()
        self._alt_path = None
        self._alt_transform = None
        self._snap_threshold = None
        self._joinstyle = 'round'
        self._capstyle = 'butt'
        self._filled = self._fillstyle != 'none'
        self._marker_function()
``` 

After making this correction, the `is_filled()` method should correctly reflect whether the marker is filled based on the `fillstyle` parameter.
