The bug in the `_recache` function is that it calls `self._marker_function()` without checking if `_marker_function` is a valid callable object. This can lead to an error if `_marker_function` is not defined or is not a function.

To fix this bug, we can add a check to ensure that `_marker_function` is callable before calling it. Below is the corrected version of the function:

```python
class MarkerStyle():
    def _recache(self):
        if self._marker_function is not None and callable(self._marker_function):
            self._path = _empty_path
            self._transform = IdentityTransform()
            self._alt_path = None
            self._alt_transform = None
            self._snap_threshold = float('inf')
            self._joinstyle = 'round'
            self._capstyle = 'butt'
            self._filled = True
            self._marker_function()
```

With this correction, the function will only call `_marker_function` if it is a valid callable object. This will prevent errors related to calling an undefined or non-function `_marker_function`.

This corrected version should pass the failing test provided.
