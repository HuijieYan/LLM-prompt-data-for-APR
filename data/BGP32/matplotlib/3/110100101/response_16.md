## Bug analysis
The `_recache` function in the `MarkerStyle` class is meant to reset certain attributes to default values and then call a marker function. However, there is a bug in the function where it attempts to call `self._marker_function` without actually checking if it exists. This can lead to an AttributeError if `_marker_function` is not defined.

## Bug fix strategy
To fix this bug, we need to check if `self._marker_function` is not `None` before calling it. This will prevent any potential AttributeError and ensure that the function behaves correctly.

## The corrected version of the buggy function

```python
class MarkerStyle():
    def _recache(self):
        if self._marker_function is not None:
            self._path = _empty_path
            self._transform = IdentityTransform()
            self._alt_path = None
            self._alt_transform = None
            self._snap_threshold = None
            self._joinstyle = 'round'
            self._capstyle = 'butt'
            self._filled = True
            self._marker_function()
```

By including the check `if self._marker_function is not None:`, we ensure that the `_marker_function` is only called if it actually exists. This fix will prevent any potential errors and allow the function to execute correctly.
