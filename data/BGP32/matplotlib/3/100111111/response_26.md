## Analysis
1. The buggy function `_recache` resets various attributes related to the appearance of markers, but it fails to update the `_filled` attribute correctly when the `_marker_function` is called. This leads to markers not being hollow as expected.
2. The failing test `test_marker_fillstyle` expects the marker style to be hollow with `fillstyle='none'`, but the `_filled` attribute is not updated correctly in the function causing the test to fail.
3. The failing test shows that the `MarkerStyle` object is filled (`is_filled()` returns `True`) even when it should be hollow, leading to the assertion error. The `_filled` attribute should be set to `False` when `fillstyle='none'` is used.
4. To fix the bug, the `_filled` attribute should be updated based on the `fillstyle` parameter value to accurately represent whether the marker is filled or not.

## Bug Fix
```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    self._filled = self._fillstyle.lower() != 'none'
    self._marker_function()
```

By changing the line `self._filled = True` to `self._filled = self._fillstyle.lower() != 'none'`, we ensure that the `_filled` attribute is updated based on the `fillstyle` parameter. This change will correctly represent whether the marker is filled or hollow, addressing the issue identified in the failing test and the GitHub issue.
