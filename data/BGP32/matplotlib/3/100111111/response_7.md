## Root Cause of the Bug

The bug in the `_recache` function arises from the fact that it resets the `_filled` attribute to `True` unconditionally at the end of the function. This causes the `is_filled` method to return `True` even when the desired behavior is to have a "hollow" marker with `fillstyle='none'`. 

This leads to the failing test `assert not marker_style.is_filled()` since the `is_filled` method incorrectly returns `True` due to the `_filled` attribute being set to `True` in the `_recache` function.

## Fixing the Bug

To fix the bug, we need to update the `_recache` function to properly handle the case where `fillstyle='none'`. We can set the `_filled` attribute based on the `fillstyle` parameter. If `fillstyle` is `'full'`, `_filled` should be `True` and if `fillstyle` is `'none'`, `_filled` should be `False`.

Here is the corrected version of the `_recache` function:

```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    
    if self._fillstyle is not None:
        self._filled = self._fillstyle != 'none'
    else:
        self._filled = True
    
    self._marker_function()
```

By setting `_filled` based on the `fillstyle` parameter, the function now correctly handles the case where a hollow marker is required with `fillstyle='none'`.

## Expected Output

After applying the fix, the corrected version of the `_recache` function should pass the failing test and produce the expected output for the provided test case. This will ensure that setting `fillstyle='none'` results in a hollow marker, as intended by the user as mentioned in the GitHub issue.
