## Analysis
The buggy function `_recache` sets the marker attributes to default values, including `_filled` being set to `True`, which causes the markers to be filled even when `fillstyle='none'`. This behavior is not desired, as the expected result should be hollow markers when `fillstyle='none'`.

The failing test `test_marker_fillstyle` checks the `is_filled` method of a `MarkerStyle` object after setting `fillstyle='none'`, leading to an assertion error due to the markers being considered as filled (`True`).

The GitHub issue confirms that there is an expectation for markers to be hollow when `fillstyle='none'`, but the current behavior does not align with it.



## Bug Cause
The bug occurs because the `_filled` attribute is always set to `True` in the `_recache` function, irrespective of the `fillstyle` parameter. This leads to the `is_filled` method always returning `True`, causing the test to fail.



## Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, update the `_recache` function so that it correctly handles the `fillstyle` parameter. If `fillstyle` is set to `'none'`, set `_filled` to `False` to ensure that markers are hollow. This adjustment will align the behavior with the expected result and resolve the failing test.



## The corrected version of the function
```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    self._filled = self._fillstyle != 'none'  # Update _filled based on fillstyle
    self._marker_function()
```

By updating the `_recache` function in this way, the markers will correctly display as filled or hollow based on the `fillstyle='none'` parameter, resolving the bug and passing the failing test.
