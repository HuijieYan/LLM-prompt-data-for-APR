## Analysis
1. The buggy function `_recache` is failing to correctly initialize the `_filled` attribute based on the `fillstyle` parameter of `MarkerStyle`.
2. The test function `test_marker_fillstyle` is asserting that the marker style is not filled, but the `_filled` attribute is set to `True` in the `_recache` function.
3. Due to this bug, the test fails with an AssertionError stating that `not True` is expected, which indicates that the marker style is being considered as filled even though it should not be.
4. To fix this bug, we need to update the `_filled` attribute based on the `fillstyle` parameter of `MarkerStyle`.

## Correction
```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    self._filled = self._fillstyle != 'none'  # Update _filled attribute based on fillstyle parameter
    self._marker_function()
```

By updating the `_filled` attribute based on the `fillstyle` parameter, the corrected function ensures that the marker style is correctly interpreted as filled or not filled according to the `MarkerStyle` settings.
