## Correction

After analyzing the buggy function and identifying the issue, it appears that the bug lies in the `_recache` function where the `_filled` attribute is always set to `True`. This causes the `is_filled()` function to always return `True` even if the `fillstyle` is set to `'none'`.

To fix this bug, the `_filled` attribute needs to be assigned based on the `fillstyle` attribute in the `MarkerStyle` class.

Here is the corrected version of the `_recache` function:

```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    self._filled = self._fillstyle.lower() != 'none'  # Updated line
    self._marker_function()
```

With this correction, the `is_filled()` function will return `False` when the `fillstyle` is set to `'none'`, satisfying the expected behavior as described in the failing test.

This fix should address the issue reported on GitHub where markers were not hollow when setting `fillstyle='none'`.
