### Analysis
1. The function `_recache` is missing the assignment for the `_fillstyle` attribute, which results in the marker not being hollow when the fillstyle is set to `'none'`.
2. The failing test `test_marker_fillstyle` expects the `is_filled()` method to return `False` when the fillstyle is set to `'none'`, but due to the missing `_fillstyle` assignment, the default value of `True` for `_filled` attribute is causing the test to fail.

### Bug Cause
The missing assignment of the `_fillstyle` attribute causes the marker to be filled by default, even when the fillstyle is set to `'none'`. This leads to incorrect behavior when checking if the marker is filled, causing the test to fail.

### Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to assign the value `'none'` to the `_fillstyle` attribute when creating a new instance of `MarkerStyle`. This will ensure that the marker is rendered as hollow when fillstyle is set to `'none', and the `is_filled()` method returns the correct value.

### Corrected Version
```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    self._filled = True
    self._fillstyle = 'none'  # Added assignment for fillstyle
    self._marker_function()
```

After making this change, the `test_marker_fillstyle` should pass, and the markers should appear hollow when the fillstyle is set to `'none'`.
