## Bug Explanation
In the given buggy function `_recache`, the `is_filled` method seems to be returning a boolean value instead of updating the `_filled` instance variable correctly. This leads to the test failure where it expects the marker to not be filled (`_filled` should be `False`), but due to the incorrect implementation, it remains `True`.

## Bug Fix Strategy
To fix this bug, the `is_filled` method needs to correctly update the `_filled` instance variable to reflect the desired fill style. This can be done by modifying the `is_filled` method to set `_filled` based on the provided fillstyle in the `MarkerStyle` class. Additionally, the `MarkerStyle` class should initialize the `_filled` variable based on the `fillstyle` parameter passed during initialization.

## The corrected version of the buggy function
```python
# The corrected version of the buggy function
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    self._filled = self._fillstyle != 'none'  # Updated line to set filled status based on fillstyle
    self._marker_function()
```

In this corrected version, the `_filled` instance variable is set based on the `fillstyle` parameter provided during the initialization of the `MarkerStyle` class. This change ensures that the fill status of the marker is correctly reflected, allowing the failing test to pass as expected.
