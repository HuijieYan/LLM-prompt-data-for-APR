### Analysis
The `_recache` function is part of the `markers` package in `matplotlib`, and it is used to reset internal variables related to the marker style. The bug occurs in the section where the `_filled` variable is mistakenly set to `True` unconditionally, even when the `fillstyle` is set to `'none'`.

The failing test `test_marker_fillstyle` checks if the `is_filled` method returns `False` after creating a marker style with `fillstyle='none'`. However, due to the bug, `_filled` is always set to `True`, causing the `is_filled` method to return `True`, which creates a mismatch.

### Bug Explanation
The bug is caused by the incorrect setting of the `_filled` variable in the `_recache` function. Since `_filled` is always set to `True` regardless of the `fillstyle` parameter, the `is_filled` method incorrectly returns `True` when it should return `False` for markers with `fillstyle='none'`.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to update the `_filled` variable based on the `fillstyle` parameter. If the `fillstyle` is `'none'`, then the `_filled` variable should be set to `False` to accurately represent the hollow marker.

### Corrected Version
```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    
    # Update _filled based on fillstyle
    if self.fillstyle == 'none':
        self._filled = False
    else:
        self._filled = True
    
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    self._marker_function()
```

By updating the `_filled` variable based on the `fillstyle` parameter, the corrected version of the function will accurately reflect the desired marker style, allowing the failing test `test_marker_fillstyle` to pass as expected.
