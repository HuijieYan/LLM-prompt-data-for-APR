## Fixing the Bug

### Issue:
The bug is in the `_recache` function where when the `_marker_function` is called at the end, it does not update the `_filled` attribute correctly, causing the failing test.

### Strategy for Fixing:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the `_filled` attribute is updated correctly based on the `fillstyle` parameter given during the creation of `MarkerStyle`. We can achieve this by checking the `fillstyle` in the `_recache` function and updating the `_filled` attribute accordingly.

### Code Fix:
```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    
    # Check fillstyle to update the _filled attribute
    self._filled = self._fillstyle is not 'none'
    
    self._marker_function()
```

By making this change, the `_filled` attribute will be updated correctly based on the given `fillstyle`, allowing the test case `test_marker_fillstyle` to pass successfully.
