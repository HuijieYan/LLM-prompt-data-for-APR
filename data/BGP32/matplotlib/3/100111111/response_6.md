## Analysis
1. The buggy function `_recache` is incomplete and doesn't handle the case where `_filled` needs to be set to `False` based on the `fillstyle` parameter.
2. The failing test `test_marker_fillstyle` tries to verify that the `is_filled` method returns `False` when `fillstyle='none'`, but it fails due to the missing logic in `_recache`.

## Bug Cause
The bug occurs because the function `_recache` does not check the `fillstyle` parameter and set the `_filled` attribute accordingly. As a result, the `is_filled` method always returns `True`, causing the failing test.

## Fix Strategy
We need to update the `_recache` function to handle the case where `self._fillstyle` is set to `'none'` by setting `self._filled` to `False`. This change will ensure that the correct filled status is maintained based on the `fillstyle` parameter.

## The corrected version of the buggy function
```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    self._filled = self.get_fillstyle() != 'none'
    self._marker_function()
```

By updating the `_recache` function as shown above, the correct filled status will be set based on the `fillstyle` parameter, resolving the issue with the failing test and aligning with the expected behavior.
