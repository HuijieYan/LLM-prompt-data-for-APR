## Analysis
The buggy function `_recache()` in `markers.py` is supposed to set default values to several attributes of the `MarkerStyle` class instance. However, the bug is that the function fails to set the `self._filled` attribute correctly, always setting it to `True`. This causes issues in the `is_filled()` method, leading to failing tests when trying to assert `not marker_style.is_filled()`.

The failing test case `test_marker_fillstyle()` aims to create a `MarkerStyle` instance with `fillstyle='none'` and then assert that it is not filled (`is_filled()` returns `False`), but due to the bug, the `is_filled()` method is not working correctly since the `_recache()` function incorrectly sets `self._filled` to `True`.

## Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, the `_recache()` function should set the `self._filled` attribute based on the `fillstyle` provided when creating the `MarkerStyle` instance. If the fillstyle is 'none', the `self._filled` attribute should be set to `False`. This way, the `is_filled()` method will work correctly, and the failing test case will pass.

## The corrected version of the buggy function
```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    self._filled = self._fillstyle != 'none'
    self._marker_function()
```

By modifying the assignment of `self._filled` based on `self._fillstyle`, the bug is fixed, and the failing test case `test_marker_fillstyle()` should now pass as expected.
