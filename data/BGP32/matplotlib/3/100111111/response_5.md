## Analysis
The `_recache` function is intended to reset certain attributes of the object. In this case, the bug lies in the fact that the `_filled` attribute is always set to `True` at the end of the function, regardless of any initial value or desired setting. This leads to the test failing when it expects `_filled` to be `False`.

## Error Cause
The root cause of the bug can be attributed to the hardcoded assignment of `self._filled = True` at the end of the `_recache` function, overriding any intended setting of this attribute.

## Solution Strategy
To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the `_filled` attribute retains the value it is supposed to have, which is determined by the `fillstyle` passed during object initialization.

## Updated Function
```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    if self._fillstyle in ['full', 'left', 'right', 'bottom', 'top']:
        self._filled = True
    else:
        self._filled = False
    self._marker_function()
```

In the updated function, the `_filled` attribute is correctly set based on the `fillstyle` value provided during object creation. This modification ensures that the intended behavior of the test is met, thus fixing the bug.
