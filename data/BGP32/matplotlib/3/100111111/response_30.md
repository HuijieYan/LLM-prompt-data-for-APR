## Analysis
The buggy function `_recache` seems to be failing to update the `_filled` attribute correctly, causing the `is_filled()` method to return `True` instead of the expected `False`. This leads to the failing test case `assert not marker_style.is_filled()`.

## Error Location
The issue lies in the `_recache` function where the `_filled` attribute is always set to `True` and never updated based on the fillstyle provided.

## Bug Cause
The bug is caused by not updating the `_filled` attribute based on the provided fillstyle, resulting in the default value of `True` being retained regardless of the desired fillstyle behavior.

## Proposed Fix
To fix the bug, we need to update the `_filled` attribute based on the provided fillstyle. If the fillstyle is set to `'none'`, then `_filled` should be set to `False`.

## Corrected Version
```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    self._filled = self._fillstyle != 'none'
    self._marker_function()
```

With this correction, the `_filled` attribute will be updated based on the provided fillstyle, ensuring that the `is_filled()` method returns the correct value.
