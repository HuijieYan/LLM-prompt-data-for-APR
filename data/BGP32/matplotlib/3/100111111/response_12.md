## Analysis
1. The buggy function `_recache` in `markers.py` initializes the properties of a MarkerStyle object. In this case, the issue arises from the `_filled` property always being set to `True` even when `fillstyle='none'` is specified.
2. The failing test `test_marker_fillstyle` checks whether the marker is filled or not based on the `is_filled()` method of MarkerStyle.
3. In the failing test, the `is_filled()` method returns `True`, indicating that the `MarkerStyle` is considered filled even when the `fillstyle='none'`.
4. To fix the bug, the `_filled` property needs to be updated based on the `fillstyle` parameter provided during MarkerStyle initialization.

## Bug Cause
The bug arises from the fact that the `_filled` property is always set to `True` unconditionally in the `_recache` function. This results in markers being considered filled even when `fillstyle='none'` is specified. As a result, the `is_filled()` method incorrectly returns `True`, leading to the failing test.

## Bug Fix Strategy
1. Update the `_filled` property based on the `fillstyle` parameter provided during the initialization of the MarkerStyle object. If `fillstyle` is set to `'none'`, then `_filled` should be set to `False`.
2. Ensure that the `_filled` property reflects the desired filled status of the MarkerStyle to match the provided `fillstyle`.

## Corrected Version
```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    self._filled = self._fillstyle != 'none'  # Update _filled based on fillstyle
    self._marker_function()
```

With this correction, the `_filled` property of the `MarkerStyle` object will be updated based on the `fillstyle` parameter provided during initialization, ensuring that markers are correctly considered filled or hollow. This change will address the failing test and resolve the issue reported on GitHub.
