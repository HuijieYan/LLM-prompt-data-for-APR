## Analysis
1. The buggy function `_recache` is responsible for resetting various attributes of a marker style object. The key issue is that it calls `self._marker_function()` which is expected to update the marker style properties, but in the failing test, `MarkerStyle` has `fillstyle='none'` which is not updated correctly.
   
2. The failing test expects `is_filled()` to return `False`, indicating that the marker should not be filled.
   
3. The failing test fails because the `_recache` function is not properly handling the case where `fillstyle='none'` is passed to the marker style object. The `self._filled` attribute is set to `True` unconditionally, causing `is_filled()` to return `True` incorrectly.

4. To fix the bug, we need to check the `fillstyle` parameter in the `_recache` function and update the `self._filled` attribute accordingly.

## Bug Fix
```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    
    if self.get_fillstyle() == 'none':
        self._filled = False
    else:
        self._filled = True
        
    self._marker_function()
```

In this fix, we added a conditional check to update the `self._filled` attribute based on the `fillstyle` property of the marker style object. If `fillstyle` is set to `'none'`, then `self._filled` is set to `False`, indicating that the marker should not be filled. Otherwise, the `self._filled` attribute retains its default behavior of being filled.

This fix ensures that the marker style is properly updated according to the `fillstyle` parameter, resolving the issue reported in the GitHub bug.
