### Error Analysis:
The `_recache` function is intended to reset certain attributes to default values and call the `_marker_function`, but it is not correctly handling the `self._filled` attribute. The attribute `self._filled` is set to `True` initially, but it should be set to `False` if the fillstyle is set to `'none'`. This discrepancy is causing the failing test to assert `not True` for `marker_style.is_filled()` instead of `False`.

### Bug Cause:
The `_recache` function does not update the `self._filled` attribute based on the fillstyle parameter, resulting in incorrect behavior in the failing test case. It should set `self._filled` to `False` when the fillstyle is `'none'`.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, update the `_recache` function to correctly handle the `self._filled` attribute based on the fillstyle parameter. If the fillstyle is set to `'none' during the creation of the `MarkerStyle`, set `self._filled` to `False`. This adjustment will ensure that the expected behavior is achieved in the failing test case.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = IdentityTransform()
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    self._filled = self._fillstyle != 'none'  # Update _filled based on fillstyle
    self._marker_function()
```

With this correction in place, the failing test `test_marker_fillstyle` should pass successfully, and the expected behavior of the `MarkerStyle` class will be achieved when the fillstyle is set to `'none' as intended by the user.
