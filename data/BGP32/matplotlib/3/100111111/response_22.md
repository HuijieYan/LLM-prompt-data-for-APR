## Analysis
The `_recache` function is responsible for reinitializing various attributes related to markers used in matplotlib. However, in its current state, it fails to update the `_filled` attribute correctly, resulting in markers not being hollow when the fillstyle is set to 'none'.

The failing test `test_marker_fillstyle` checks if the `is_filled` method of `MarkerStyle` returns `False` after setting the fillstyle to 'none'. The test fails because the `_filled` attribute is not being updated correctly within the `_recache` function.

## Error
The bug is due to a missing update to the `_filled` attribute in the `_recache` function. The `_filled` attribute is always set to `True`, resulting in the markers not being hollow even when the fillstyle is 'none'.

## Proposed Fix
To fix the bug, we need to update the `_filled` attribute based on the fillstyle provided. If the fillstyle is 'none', then the `_filled` attribute should be set to `False`.

## The corrected version of the function
```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    self._filled = self._fillstyle != 'none'
    self._marker_function()
```

By updating the `_filled` attribute based on the fillstyle provided, the markers will correctly appear as hollow when the fillstyle is set to 'none'.
