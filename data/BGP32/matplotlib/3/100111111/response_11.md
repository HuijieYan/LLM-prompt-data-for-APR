## Fixing the buggy function

### Identify the bug
The bug in the `_recache` function is that it sets `_filled` to `True` unconditionally, which contradicts the expectation of an empty fillstyle as shown in the failing test. The `is_filled` method erroneously returns `True` because of this incorrect assignment.

### Strategy for fixing the bug
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the `_filled` attribute reflects the fillstyle correctly. If the fillstyle is 'none', the `_filled` attribute should be set to `False`.

### Corrected version of the function
```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    self._filled = self._fillstyle != 'none'
    self._marker_function()
```

By updating the assignment of the `_filled` attribute based on the `_fillstyle` value, the corrected function will ensure that the `is_filled` method reflects the intended behavior for different fillstyles.
