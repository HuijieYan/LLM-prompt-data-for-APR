### Analysis:
1. The `_recache` function is responsible for resetting some internal variables related to markers in Matplotlib.
2. The failing test `test_marker_fillstyle` creates a `MarkerStyle` object with `fillstyle='none'` and checks if `is_filled` returns `False`, but it fails.
3. In the failing test error message, it's evident that the `is_filled` method is returning `True`, which indicates that the `_filled` variable is not being properly reset in the `_recache` function.
4. The GitHub issue indicates that setting `fillstyle='none'` does not result in hollow markers while using `ax.scatter()`, which aligns with the failing test issue.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is due to the `_filled` variable not being properly reset in the `_recache` function, resulting in the `MarkerStyle` object incorrectly returning `True` for `is_filled`, even when `fillstyle='none'`.

### Bug Fix:
We need to ensure that the `_filled` variable is correctly set to `False` when resetting the marker variables in the `_recache` function.

### Corrected Function:
```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    self._filled = False  # Fix: Reset _filled to False
    self._marker_function()
```

By updating the `_filled` variable to `False` in the `_recache` function, the issue with the failing test and GitHub bug should be resolved.
