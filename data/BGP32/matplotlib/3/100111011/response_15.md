### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_recache` is failing to properly update the `_filled` variable based on the marker style defined.
2. The failing test `test_marker_fillstyle` is checking if the `is_filled` method returns the correct value based on the fill style specified. However, due to the bug, the fill style is not being properly handled.
3. The error message indicates that the assertion `assert not True` is failing, which means that the `is_filled` method is returning `True` incorrectly.
4. The issue on GitHub suggests that setting the fill style to 'none' is not rendering the markers as hollow, which aligns with the bug in the `_recache` function.
   
### Bug Cause:
The bug in the `_recache` function is that it always sets `_filled` to `True`, regardless of the fill style specified. This leads to the `is_filled` method always returning `True`, even when the fill style is set to 'none'.

### Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to update the `_filled` variable based on the fill style specified in the marker style.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    
    # Check if fillstyle is 'none' to determine if the marker should be filled
    if self._fillstyle == 'none':
        self._filled = False
    else:
        self._filled = True
    
    self._marker_function()
```

By updating the `_filled` variable based on the fill style specified, the corrected version of the `_recache` function should now properly handle the fill style of markers, resolving the issue reported on GitHub.
