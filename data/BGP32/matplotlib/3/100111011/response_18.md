## Analysis:
- The `_recache` function is not correctly setting the `_filled` attribute to `False` when `fillstyle='none'`.
- The failing test is checking if the marker style is filled, which is failing due to the incorrect setting of the `_filled` attribute.
- The error message indicates that `assert not True` failed, showing that the marker style is being considered as filled which is incorrect.
- The input parameters are irrelevant to the issue, but the incorrect setting of the `_filled` attribute is causing the problem.

## Bug Cause:
The bug is caused by not correctly updating the `_filled` attribute when the `fillstyle` is set to `'none'`. The `_recache` function always sets `_filled` to `True`, leading to the failing test.

## Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to update the `_recache` function to correctly handle the case when `fillstyle` is set to `'none'` by setting `_filled` to `False`.

## Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    
    # Update _filled based on the fillstyle
    if self.get_fillstyle() == 'none':
        self._filled = False
    else:
        self._filled = True
        
    self._marker_function()
```

By adding a condition to update the `_filled` attribute based on the `fillstyle`, we ensure that the marker style is correctly considered as filled or hollow based on the input parameters.
