## Analysis
The buggy function `_recache` is supposed to reset certain attributes to default values, and then call the `_marker_function`. However, in the provided buggy code, there is inconsistency regarding the use of `_marker_function`. It is being called without checking if it exists or not, potentially leading to errors.

The failing test `test_marker_fillstyle` utilizes the `MarkerStyle` class with `fillstyle='none'`. The failing assertion `assert not marker_style.is_filled()` indicates that the marker is not being set to hollow as expected due to the incorrect behavior of the `_recache` function.

Based on the runtime values provided, it seems like the `_filled` attribute is being set to `True` in the `_recache` function which contradicts the intention of setting `fillstyle='none'` in the `MarkerStyle` object. This could be the cause of the bug reported in the GitHub issue.

## Bug Fix Strategy
1. Check if the `_marker_function` exists before calling it to prevent potential errors.
2. Update the `_filled` attribute to reflect the desired behavior when setting `fillstyle='none'` in the `MarkerStyle` object.

## Corrected Version
```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is not None:
        self._path = _empty_path
        self._transform = IdentityTransform()
        self._alt_path = None
        self._alt_transform = None
        self._snap_threshold = None
        self._joinstyle = 'round'
        self._capstyle = 'butt'
        
        if self.get_fillstyle() == 'none':
            self._filled = False
        else:
            self._filled = True
            
        self._marker_function()
```

In the corrected version, the `_filled` attribute is updated based on the `fillstyle` set in the `MarkerStyle` object. If `fillstyle='none'`, `_filled` is set to `False` indicating that the marker should be hollow. This modification ensures that the markers behave as expected when setting `fillstyle='none'`.
