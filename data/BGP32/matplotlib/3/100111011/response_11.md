### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_recache` in `markers.py` resets several attributes to default values and then calls the `_marker_function`. The issue arises from the fact that the `_marker_function` gets called regardless of the `self._marker_function` being `None`. This leads to unexpected behavior when `MarkerStyle` instances are used.
2. The failing test `test_marker_fillstyle()` aims to create a `MarkerStyle` instance with `fillstyle='none'` and check if it is not filled. However, the buggy behavior causes the `is_filled()` method to return `True`.
3. The cause of the bug is the unconditional call to `_marker_function` and the lack of proper handling for the case when `self._marker_function` is `None`.
4. To fix the bug, we need to check if `self._marker_function` is not `None` before calling it in the `_recache` function.

### Fixing the Bug:
Here is the corrected version of the `_recache` function to address the bug:

```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is not None:  # Check if _marker_function is not None
        self._path = _empty_path
        self._transform = IdentityTransform()
        self._alt_path = None
        self._alt_transform = None
        self._snap_threshold = None
        self._joinstyle = 'round'
        self._capstyle = 'butt'
        self._filled = True
        self._marker_function()
```

By adding the check for `self._marker_function is not None`, we ensure that the `_marker_function` is only called when it is defined. This modification will prevent unexpected behavior and resolve the issue reported on GitHub.

Now, when the `MarkerStyle` instance is created with `fillstyle='none'`, the `is_filled()` method should correctly return `False`, as intended.
