### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_recache` sets various attributes to default values and then calls `_marker_function`. The issue arises from the fact that the specific attributes `self._path`, `self._snap_threshold`, `self._joinstyle`, `self._capstyle`, and `self._filled` are not properly initialized, leading to incorrect behavior in certain scenarios.
2. The failing test `test_marker_fillstyle` checks whether the `is_filled()` method returns False after setting `fillstyle='none'`.
3. The failing test reports an assertion error because the `is_filled()` method does not return the expected result of False even after setting `fillstyle='none'`. This discrepancy occurs because the `_filled` attribute is not properly synced or updated based on the `fillstyle` parameter.
4. To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the `_filled` attribute accurately reflects the `fillstyle` parameter. This can be achieved by updating the `_filled` attribute based on the `fillstyle` parameter in the `MarkerStyle` constructor, so it correctly reflects whether the marker should be filled or not.

### Corrected Version:
```python
# Fixed version of the _recache function
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    self._filled = False if self._fillstyle == 'none' else True
    self._marker_function()
```

By adding a condition to set `_filled` based on the `fillstyle` parameter during the initialization of a `MarkerStyle` object, we ensure that the `is_filled()` method returns the correct value according to the `fillstyle` setting.

This correction addresses the bug reported in the failing test and resolves the issue described on GitHub where markers were not appearing as hollow when `fillstyle='none'` was set for `MarkerStyle`.
