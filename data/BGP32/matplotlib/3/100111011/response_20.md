### Analysis:
1. The `_recache` function initializes various attributes to default values in preparation for updating the marker style. However, it is missing the logic to handle the `fillstyle` attribute.
2. The failing test `test_marker_fillstyle` checks if the `is_filled` method of the `MarkerStyle` object returns `False`. The current implementation does not properly handle the `fillstyle`, causing the `is_filled` method to return `True` incorrectly.
3. In the failing test, the `is_filled` method is expected to return `False` based on the `fillstyle` set to 'none'. However, the buggy function does not consider the `fillstyle` attribute at all, leading to the assertion error.
4. To fix the bug, we need to incorporate the `fillstyle` attribute into the `_recache` function so that the `is_filled` method can correctly determine whether the marker is filled or not.

### Proposed Fix:
```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    self._filled = self.get_fillstyle() != 'none'
    self._marker_function()
```

By updating the `_recache` function to set the `_filled` attribute based on the `fillstyle`, the marker style will correctly reflect whether it is filled or hollow. This modification addresses the bug reported in the failing test and the GitHub issue related to setting markers as hollow.
