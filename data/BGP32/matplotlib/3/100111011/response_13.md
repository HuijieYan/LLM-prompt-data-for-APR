### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_recache` initializes various attributes to default values and then calls the `_marker_function`.
2. The failing test `test_marker_fillstyle` checks if the marker style is not filled.
3. The error message indicates that the `is_filled` method is returning `True` unexpectedly, causing the assertion error.
4. The reported GitHub issue indicates that setting `fillstyle='none'` should result in hollow markers, but the behavior is not as expected.
  
### Error Cause:
The bug is likely in the implementation of the `MarkerStyle` class where the `is_filled` method is incorrectly determining if the marker is filled or not.

### Fix Strategy:
1. Update the `is_filled` method in the `MarkerStyle` class to correctly handle the `fillstyle='none'` case.
2. Ensure that the behavior aligns with the expectation mentioned in the GitHub issue.

### Corrected Version:
```python
# The corrected version of the buggy function
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    self._filled = self.fillstyle != 'none'  # Update filled based on fillstyle
    self._marker_function()
```

By updating the `_recache` function to consider the `fillstyle` attribute when setting the `_filled` attribute, the corrected version should address the issue. This change ensures that setting `fillstyle='none'` correctly results in hollow markers as expected.
