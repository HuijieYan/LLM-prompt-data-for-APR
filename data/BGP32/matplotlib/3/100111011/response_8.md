### Analysis
The `_recache` function in the `markers.py` file seems to have an issue where it is not correctly updating the properties of the `MarkerStyle` object, specifically the `self._filled` property. This results in the `is_filled` method returning `True` even when `fillstyle` is set to `'none'`, causing the failing test.

The failing test `test_marker_fillstyle` creates a `MarkerStyle` object with `'o'` marker and `'none'` fillstyle, and then checks if the `fillstyle` is `'none' and if the marker is filled using the `is_filled()` method, which should return `False` in this case. However, the incorrect behavior of `_recache` is causing it to return `True`.

The runtime values show that `self._filled` is set to `True`, which is incorrect considering the `fillstyle` is `'none' as per the failing test.

### Fix Strategy
To fix this bug, the `_recache` function needs to correctly update the `self._filled` property based on the `fillstyle` parameter passed during the creation of the `MarkerStyle` object. This can be achieved by updating the `_recache` function to check the `fillstyle` and update `self._filled` accordingly.

### Corrected Version
```python
# Corrected version of the _recache function
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'

    # Update self._filled based on fillstyle
    if self._fillstyle == 'none':
        self._filled = False
    else:
        self._filled = True

    self._marker_function()
```

With this correction, the `MarkerStyle` object's `fillstyle` will correctly update the `self._filled` property, ensuring that the `is_filled()` method returns the expected result.
