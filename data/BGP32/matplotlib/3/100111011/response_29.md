### Analysis:
The buggy function `_recache` is failing to properly reset the marker properties. The issue from GitHub indicates that setting `fillstyle='none'` should result in hollow markers, but the current implementation doesn't handle this correctly, leading to the failing test `test_marker_fillstyle`.

### Bug Cause:
1. The function `test_marker_fillstyle` creates a `MarkerStyle` instance with `fillstyle='none'`.
2. The `MarkerStyle.is_filled()` method is supposed to return `False` when `fillstyle='none'`, but due to the bug in `_recache`, it doesn't work as expected.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To resolve the bug, we need to ensure that the `MarkerStyle` instance behaves as expected when `fillstyle='none'`. This involves updating the `_recache` function to properly handle the `filled` property based on the `fillstyle` provided.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    if self.get_fillstyle() == 'none':
        self._filled = False
    else:
        self._filled = True
    self._marker_function()
```

By adding the condition to set `_filled` to `False` when the `fillstyle` is `'none'`, the corrected version ensures that the `is_filled()` method works as expected, solving the bug and enabling the hollow markers as intended in the GitHub issue.
