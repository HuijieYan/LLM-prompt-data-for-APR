## Analysis:
The buggy function `_recache` is responsible for resetting several attributes of the `MarkerStyle` object but it is not calling the `marker_function` that is needed for updating the marker's appearance. This leads to unexpected behavior when trying to check if the marker is filled or not in the failing test.

## Bug Cause:
The bug is caused by the `_recache` function not calling the `_marker_function` which is essential for updating the marker's properties. As a result, when the test tries to check if the marker is filled or not, it doesn't reflect the expected behavior due to the missing update.

## Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, the `_recache` function should include a call to the `_marker_function` after resetting the attributes to ensure the marker's properties are updated correctly.

## Corrected Version of the Buggy Function:
```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: lib/matplotlib/markers.py

# Corrected version of the buggy function
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    self._filled = True
    self._marker_function()  # Add this line to update the marker's appearance
```

By adding the call to `_marker_function`, the corrected version ensures that the marker's properties are updated properly, resolving the issue where the markers were not appearing as expected when trying to set them as hollow.

This fix should now make the failing test `test_marker_fillstyle` pass successfully without asserting an incorrect result.
