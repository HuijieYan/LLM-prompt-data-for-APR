### Analysis:
1. The `_recache` function is responsible for setting various attributes to default values and then calling the `_marker_function()`.
2. The failing test `test_marker_fillstyle` is trying to check if the marker is filled or not, but due to a buggy implementation, it fails.
3. Based on the runtime values provided, the `_filled` attribute is set to `True`, which is causing the assertion failure in the test.
4. The issue on GitHub indicates that setting `fillstyle='none'` does not make the markers hollow as expected.
   
### Bug Cause:
The bug is caused by not correctly handling the `fillstyle` parameter while setting up the marker properties in the `_recache` function. The default value of `_filled` being set to `True` even when `fillstyle='none'` causing the marker to be filled, contrary to expectations.

### Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that when `fillstyle='none'`, the `_filled` attribute is set to `False` to make the marker hollow.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    if 'fillstyle' in self._marker:
        if self._marker['fillstyle'] == 'none':
            self._filled = False
        else:
            self._filled = True
    else:
        self._filled = True
    self._marker_function()
```

In the corrected version, we check if the `fillstyle` is set to `'none'` in the marker properties and accordingly set the `_filled` attribute to `False` to make the marker hollow. This fix should address the issue reported on GitHub and ensure that the failing test `test_marker_fillstyle` passes successfully.
