## Analysis
The buggy function `_recache` in the `MarkerStyle` class is intended to reset certain attributes to default values. However, the issue lies in the line `self._marker_function()` which is attempting to call an unknown `_marker_function` attribute. This call results in an error in the test function that checks if the marker is filled, causing the test to fail.

## Bug Cause
- The `_recache` function is trying to call a non-existent method `_marker_function` which leads to a failure in the test function.
- The error message indicates that the `MarkerStyle` object does not have an attribute `is_filled`, indicating that the `_marker_function` call is incorrect.

## Proposed Fix
To fix the bug, we need to remove the unnecessary `_marker_function()` call and only reset the desired attributes to default values.

## Corrected Version
```python
class MarkerStyle:

    def _recache(self):
        self._path = _empty_path
        self._transform = IdentityTransform()
        self._alt_path = None
        self._alt_transform = None
        self._snap_threshold = None
        self._joinstyle = 'round'
        self._capstyle = 'butt'
        self._filled = True
```

After applying this fix, the `_recache` function will correctly reset the specified attributes without causing any errors or failures in the test function.
