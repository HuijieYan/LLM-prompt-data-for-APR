## Analysis
The buggy function `_recache` in the `MarkerStyle` class is responsible for resetting various attributes of a marker style. In the failing test `test_marker_fillstyle`, the test is checking if the marker style is filled or not by calling the `is_filled()` method after setting the marker style's fillstyle to `'none'`.

The error message indicates that the `assert not marker_style.is_filled()` assertion fails, which means that the `is_filled()` method is returning `True` when it should be returning `False` since the fillstyle is set to `'none'`.

Looking at the buggy function, the bug stems from the fact that `_marker_function` is called without checking its return value. This function is responsible for setting the marker properties based on the chosen marker style. Since `_marker_function` is called regardless of the `fillstyle`, it is likely overriding the `filled` attribute to `True`.

## Fix Strategy
To fix this issue, we need to ensure that `_marker_function` is only called if necessary, based on the fillstyle chosen. We should check for the fillstyle inside the `_recache` method and decide whether to call `_marker_function` or not.

## The corrected version of the function
```python
class MarkerStyle:
    def _recache(self):
        if self._marker_function is None:
            return
        
        if self.get_fillstyle() == 'none':
            self._filled = False
        else:
            self._filled = True
        
        self._path = _empty_path
        self._transform = IdentityTransform()
        self._alt_path = None
        self._alt_transform = None
        self._snap_threshold = None
        self._joinstyle = 'round'
        self._capstyle = 'butt'
        
        if self._filled:
            self._marker_function()
```

By adding the conditional check to set the `_filled` attribute based on the chosen fillstyle before calling `_marker_function`, we ensure that the `MarkerStyle` object correctly reflects whether it is filled or not based on the provided style. This correction should address the issue and pass the failing test.
