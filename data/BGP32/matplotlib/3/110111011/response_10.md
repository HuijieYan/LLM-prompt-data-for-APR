## Potential Error Locations:
1. The `_marker_function()` call might not set the necessary attributes properly.
2. The assignment of `self._filled = True` might be incorrect for the desired behavior.

## Cause of the Bug:
The bug occurs because the `MarkerStyle` class fails to correctly implement the behavior of having hollow markers when the `fillstyle` is set to `'none'`. The incorrect setting of `self._filled` to `True` overrides the intention of having hollow markers.

## Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that when `fillstyle='none'`, the markers are indeed empty, as intended. This can be achieved by modifying the `_recache()` function to correctly handle 'none' fillstyle and adjust the `_filled` attribute accordingly.

## Corrected Version of the Buggy Function:
```python
class MarkerStyle():
    def _recache(self):
        if self._marker_function is None:
            return
        self._path = _empty_path
        self._transform = IdentityTransform()
        self._alt_path = None
        self._alt_transform = None
        self._snap_threshold = None
        self._joinstyle = 'round'
        self._capstyle = 'butt'
        if self._fillstyle == 'none':
            self._filled = False
        else:
            self._filled = True
        self._marker_function()
```

By making these adjustments, the corrected version of the `MarkerStyle` class ensures that the markers are hollow when `fillstyle='none'`, resolving the issue and passing the failing test.
