### Explanation:
The bug in the `_recache` function is that when calling `self._marker_function()` at the end, it's expecting the function to return a value that indicates if the marker is filled or not. However, `self._marker_function()` is not supposed to return any value but rather set the marker's properties internally.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Remove the expectation of a return value from `self._marker_function()`.
2. Ensure that the function just sets the marker properties internally without returning any value.

### The corrected version of the function:
```python
class MarkerStyle():
    def _recache(self):
        if self._marker_function is None:
            return
        self._path = _empty_path
        self._transform = IdentityTransform()
        self._alt_path = None
        self._alt_transform = None
        self._snap_threshold = None
        self._joinstyle = 'round'
        self._capstyle = 'butt'
        self._filled = True
        self._marker_function()
```

With this correction, the function will no longer expect a return value from `_marker_function()` and will only focus on setting the marker's properties correctly. This should address the issue reported in the failing test and the GitHub issue related to markers not being hollow as expected.
