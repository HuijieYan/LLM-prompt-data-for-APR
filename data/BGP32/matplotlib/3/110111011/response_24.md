## Analysis
1. The buggy function `_recache` in the class `MarkerStyle` is supposed to reset various attributes of the `MarkerStyle` instance when called. However, the problematic part is where it attempts to call `self._marker_function()` without checking if it exists, leading to potential errors.
   
2. The error message from the failing test indicates that the `is_filled` method is not returning the expected result, causing the test to fail.

3. The values of the attributes before the return suggest that the `_filled` attribute is set to `True`, which contradicts the expectation of the test where it should be `False`.

4. The bug is caused by the incorrect initialization of the `_filled` attribute before calling the `_marker_function()`.

5. To fix the bug, ensure that `_filled` is set correctly based on the `fillstyle` parameter provided during the instantiation of the `MarkerStyle` class.

## Bug Fix
```python
class MarkerStyle():
    def __init__(self, marker=None, fillstyle='full'):
        self._filled = True if fillstyle == 'full' else False
        self._marker_function = self._set_marker
        self._recache()

    def _recache(self):
        if self._marker_function is None:
            return
        self._path = _empty_path
        self._transform = IdentityTransform()
        self._alt_path = None
        self._alt_transform = None
        self._snap_threshold = None
        self._joinstyle = 'round'
        self._capstyle = 'butt'
        self._marker_function()

    def _set_marker(self):
        # Existing or new marker styles can be defined here
        pass

    def is_filled(self):
        return self._filled

    def get_fillstyle(self):
        return 'full' if self._filled else 'none'
```

By updating the `MarkerStyle` class as shown above, specifically by correctly setting the `_filled` attribute based on the `fillstyle` provided during initialization, the bug should be resolved. This fix ensures that the `is_filled` method behaves as expected in the failing test scenario.
