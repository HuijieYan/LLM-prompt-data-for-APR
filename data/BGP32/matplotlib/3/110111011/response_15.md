### Analyzing the buggy function and its relationship with the failing test, error message, and runtime values:

1. **Buggy Function (_recache):**
   - The `_recache` function is part of the `MarkerStyle` class and is responsible for recalculating the marker properties.
   - Inside the function, if the `_marker_function` is not None, the function resets various properties like `_path`, `_transform`, `_alt_path`, `_alt_transform`, `_snap_threshold`, `_joinstyle`, `_capstyle`, and `_filled`.
   - Finally, it calls the `_marker_function`. However, there seems to be an issue with how `_filled` is handled as it might not reflect the actual fill status correctly.

2. **Failing Test (test_marker_fillstyle):**
   - The failing test aims to check the behavior of a marker with fillstyle set to 'none'.
   - It creates a `MarkerStyle` object with marker='o' and fillstyle='none'.
   - The test asserts that the `get_fillstyle` method returns 'none' correctly.
   - The second assertion checks that the marker should not be filled, which is verified by calling the `is_filled` method.

3. **Error Message:**
   - The error arises in the second assertion because the marker is mistakenly considered filled.
   - The failed assertion `assert not True` is due to an incorrect evaluation of the fill status in the `is_filled` method.

### Bug Cause:
The bug likely arises from an incorrect implementation of the `_filled` property inside the `MarkerStyle` class. The function fails to properly handle the fillstyle of the marker, leading to incorrect behavior when checking if the marker is filled or not.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the `_filled` property accurately reflects the fillstyle specified during the marker creation. This involves correctly handling the `fillstyle` parameter passed to the `MarkerStyle` constructor and updating the state based on this fillstyle.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
class MarkerStyle():
    def _recache(self):
        if self._marker_function is None:
            return
        self._path = _empty_path
        self._transform = IdentityTransform()
        self._alt_path = None
        self._alt_transform = None
        self._snap_threshold = None
        self._joinstyle = 'round'
        self._capstyle = 'butt'
        # Update the _filled property based on fillstyle parameter
        self._filled = self._fillstyle != 'none'
        self._marker_function()
```

In the corrected version, we set `_filled` based on the `fillstyle` provided when creating the `MarkerStyle` object, ensuring that the fill status is correctly reflected. This adjustment should resolve the issue reported on GitHub and make the failing test pass successfully.
