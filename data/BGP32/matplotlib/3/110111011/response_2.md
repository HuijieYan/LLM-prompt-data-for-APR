### Analysis
The `_recache` function within the `MarkerStyle` class is intended to reset certain attributes to default values if the `_marker_function` is not `None`. However, the implementation is not correctly handling the `filled` attribute. The failing test is checking if the marker is not filled, but due to the incorrect handling of the `_filled` attribute, the test fails.

### Bug Explanation
The `is_filled` method is expected to return the opposite of the `_filled` attribute. However, the `_filled` attribute is set to `True` initially and never updated or affected by the `fillstyle` parameter passed during object initialization. This inconsistency causes the failing test where `_filled` doesn't reflect the actual fillstyle value.

### Fix Strategy
To fix this bug, we need to update the `_filled` attribute based on the `fillstyle` value passed during object initialization. If the `fillstyle` is set to `'none'`, `_filled` should be set to `False`.

### Corrected Version
Here is the corrected version of the `_recache` function:

```python
# Corrected version of the buggy function
class MarkerStyle():
    def _recache(self):
        if self._marker_function is None:
            return
        self._path = _empty_path
        self._transform = IdentityTransform()
        self._alt_path = None
        self._alt_transform = None
        self._snap_threshold = None
        self._joinstyle = 'round'
        self._capstyle = 'butt'
        
        if self._fillstyle == 'none':
            self._filled = False
        else:
            self._filled = True
        
        self._marker_function()
```

By updating the `_filled` attribute based on the `fillstyle`, the corrected version of the function will now correctly reflect the intended marker style.
