### Analysis
The buggy function `_recache` in the `MarkerStyle` class is supposed to handle the recaching of marker attributes. However, the bug lies in calling `self._marker_function()` without checking its existence or functionality. This leads to the failing test `test_marker_fillstyle`.

### Error Cause
The error occurs because the `self._marker_function` is not defined in the snippet provided. When the function is called without proper checking, it leads to an unexpected behavior.

### Fix Strategy
1. Check if `self._marker_function` is not None before calling it.
2. Provide a default behavior if `self._marker_function` does not exist.

### Corrected Version
```python
# The declaration of the class containing the corrected function
class MarkerStyle():

    def _recache(self):
        if self._marker_function is None:
            return

        self._path = _empty_path
        self._transform = IdentityTransform()
        self._alt_path = None
        self._alt_transform = None
        self._snap_threshold = None
        self._joinstyle = 'round'
        self._capstyle = 'butt'
        self._filled = True

        if callable(self._marker_function):
            self._marker_function()
```

By adding the check `if callable(self._marker_function):`, the corrected function will only call `_marker_function` if it's a callable object. This will prevent the issue of calling a non-existent function and resolve the failing test.
