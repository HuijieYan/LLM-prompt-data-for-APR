### Identification of Bug:
The bug occurs in the `_recache` function of the `MarkerStyle` class. The function fails to properly update the `self._filled` attribute based on the `fillstyle` provided during initialization. This leads to incorrect behavior when checking if the marker is filled or hollow.

### Explanation of Bug:
The failing test `test_marker_fillstyle` initializes a `MarkerStyle` object with `fillstyle='none'` and then checks if the marker is filled or not using the `is_filled()` method. However, due to the bug in the `_recache` function, the `self._filled` attribute is always set to `True` regardless of the provided `fillstyle`. This causes the assertion failure in the test, as it expects the marker to be hollow but it is actually filled.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the `self._filled` attribute is updated correctly based on the provided `fillstyle`. If `fillstyle` is set to 'none', then the marker should be considered hollow, meaning `self._filled` should be set to `False`.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
class MarkerStyle():
    
    def __init__(self, marker=None, fillstyle='full'):
        self._marker_function = None
        self._fillstyle = fillstyle
        
    def _recache(self):
        if self._marker_function is None:
            return
        self._path = _empty_path
        self._transform = IdentityTransform()
        self._alt_path = None
        self._alt_transform = None
        self._snap_threshold = None
        self._joinstyle = 'round'
        self._capstyle = 'butt'
        # Update filled attribute based on fillstyle
        self._filled = True if self._fillstyle != 'none' else False
        self._marker_function()
    
    def is_filled(self):
        return self._filled
```

By updating the `_filled` attribute based on the provided `fillstyle` parameter during initialization, the corrected version of the function ensures that the `is_filled()` method reflects whether the marker should be filled or hollow as intended.
