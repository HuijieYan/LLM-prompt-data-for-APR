## Analysis:
- The buggy function `_recache` in the `MarkerStyle` class initializes various attributes but doesn't use the `fillstyle` attribute, which is crucial for determining if the marker should be filled or not.
- The failing test `test_marker_fillstyle` checks if the `is_filled()` method correctly returns `False` when the `fillstyle` is set to `'none'`, but the bug prevents this check from passing.
- The error message shows that the test fails because the `is_filled()` method doesn't return `False` as expected.
- The runtime values of variables before the return of the buggy function suggest that the `filled` attribute is still set to `True`, which is incorrect when `fillstyle` is `'none'`.

## Bug Cause:
The bug arises from not updating the `filled` attribute based on the `fillstyle` parameter, leading to incorrect behavior in determining if the marker should be filled or not.

## Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Modify the `_recache` method to consider the `fillstyle` attribute when setting the `filled` attribute.
2. Ensure that when `fillstyle` is set to `'none'`, the `filled` attribute is appropriately updated to `False`.

## Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
class MarkerStyle():
    def _recache(self):
        if self._marker_function is None:
            return
        self._path = _empty_path
        self._transform = IdentityTransform()
        self._alt_path = None
        self._alt_transform = None
        self._snap_threshold = None
        self._joinstyle = 'round'
        self._capstyle = 'butt'
        self._filled = True
        
        if self._fillstyle == 'none':
            self._filled = False
        
        self._marker_function()
```

By updating the `_recache` method to consider the `fillstyle` attribute and appropriately update the `filled` attribute based on it, we can ensure that the markers are correctly filled or hollow as expected.
