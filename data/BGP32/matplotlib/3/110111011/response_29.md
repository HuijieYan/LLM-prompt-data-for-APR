## Analysis
The `_recache` function in the `MarkerStyle` class is expected to update some internal variables when called. However, the buggy function is currently not properly handling the `_filled` attribute, which is causing the `is_filled()` method to return `True` when it should return `False`. This discrepancy is leading to the failing test for the `fillstyle`.

## Error Location
The problematic area in the buggy function is the initialization of the `_filled` attribute. It is set to `True` unconditionally, which is incorrect for markers with `fillstyle='none'`.

## Bug Cause
The `_filled` attribute is always set to `True` regardless of the `fillstyle` specified for the marker. This incorrect initialization causes the `is_filled()` method to return `True` even when `fillstyle='none'`, leading to the failing test.

## Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, the `_filled` attribute should be updated based on the `fillstyle` of the marker. If `fillstyle` is `'none'`, `_filled` should be set to `False`. This adjustment will ensure that the `is_filled()` method returns the correct value based on the `fillstyle`.

## Corrected Version
Here is the corrected version of the `_recache` function within the `MarkerStyle` class:

```python
class MarkerStyle():
    def _recache(self):
        if self._marker_function is None:
            return
        self._path = _empty_path
        self._transform = IdentityTransform()
        self._alt_path = None
        self._alt_transform = None
        self._snap_threshold = None
        self._joinstyle = 'round'
        self._capstyle = 'butt'
        # Update _filled based on fillstyle
        self._filled = self._fillstyle != 'none'
        self._marker_function()
```

By updating the `_filled` attribute dependent on the `fillstyle`, the corrected version should address the bug and allow the `is_filled()` method to return the appropriate result based on the marker's fillstyle.
