The bug in the `_recache` function is causing the `is_filled` method to return `True` incorrectly, leading to the failing test. The bug is related to markers being filled when the `fillstyle` is set to `'none'`.

### Cause of the Bug:
The bug occurs because even when `fillstyle` is set to `'none'`, the `_filled` attribute is not updated accordingly in the `_recache` function.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to update the `_filled` attribute based on the `fillstyle`. If `fillstyle` is `'none'`, `_filled` should be set to `False`.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
class MarkerStyle():

    def _recache(self):
        if self._marker_function is None:
            return
        self._path = _empty_path
        self._transform = IdentityTransform()
        self._alt_path = None
        self._alt_transform = None
        self._snap_threshold = None
        self._joinstyle = 'round'
        self._capstyle = 'butt'
        self._filled = True  # Set to True by default
        if self._fillstyle == 'none':
            self._filled = False
        self._marker_function()
```

This corrected version of the function updates the `_filled` attribute based on the `fillstyle` parameter, ensuring that markers are hollow when `fillstyle` is set to `'none'`. By updating `_filled` conditionally, the failing test that checks for the filled status of the marker should now pass correctly.
