### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_recache` in the `MarkerStyle` class is responsible for resetting various attributes of the `MarkerStyle` object. However, when the `_marker_function` is called without checking if it exists, it leads to unexpected behavior.
2. The failing test `test_marker_fillstyle` creates a `MarkerStyle` object with `fillstyle='none'` and checks if `is_filled()` returns `False`, which is failing because the `_marker_function` is called unconditionally in the `_recache` function.

### Explanation of the Bug:
The bug occurs because `_marker_function()` is called without checking if it exists, leading to unexpected behavior for markers that are intended to be hollow. This mismatch between the expected behavior and actual implementation causes the failing test.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to modify the `_recache` function to check if `_marker_function` exists before calling it. If the function exists, then proceed to call it, otherwise, skip it.

### Corrected Version:

```python
class MarkerStyle():
    def _recache(self):
        if self._marker_function is not None:
            self._path = _empty_path
            self._transform = IdentityTransform()
            self._alt_path = None
            self._alt_transform = None
            self._snap_threshold = None
            self._joinstyle = 'round'
            self._capstyle = 'butt'
            self._filled = True
            self._marker_function()
```

By adding the condition `if self._marker_function is not None:` before calling `_marker_function()`, we ensure that the marker behavior is consistent with the desired settings. This corrected version should address the issue reported on GitHub and pass the failing test.
