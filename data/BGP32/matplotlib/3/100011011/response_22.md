### Analysis:
The buggy function `_recache` initializes various attributes to default values and then calls the `_marker_function`. In the failing test, `marker_style.is_filled()` is expected to return `False`, indicating that the marker should not be filled. However, the current implementation does not change the `_filled` attribute, leading to incorrect behavior.

### Error Cause:
The `_filled` attribute is initialized as `True` but is not modified in the `_recache` function, causing `marker_style.is_filled()` to return `True` instead of `False`.

### Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to set the `_filled` attribute to `False` when the `fillstyle` is set to `'none'`.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    self._filled = self.get_fillstyle() != 'none'  # Update _filled based on fillstyle
    self._marker_function()
``` 

In the corrected version, the `_filled` attribute is updated based on the `fillstyle`, ensuring that the marker is correctly filled or not filled based on the specified `fillstyle`. This change should resolve the issue and make the failing test pass.
