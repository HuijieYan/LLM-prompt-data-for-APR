### Analysis:
1. The `_recache` function initializes various attributes of a `MarkerStyle` object, and then calls the `_marker_function` method. The issue arises when trying to set the fillstyle to `'none'` in order to create hollow markers.
2. The failing test is checking if the `is_filled` method returns `False` when `fillstyle` is set to `'none'`, however, the implementation doesn't handle this specific case correctly.
3. The error message indicates that the `is_filled` method is returning `True`, which is incorrect when `fillstyle` is set to `'none'`. This is causing the test to fail.
4. To fix the bug, we need to modify the `_recache` function and the `is_filled` method to correctly handle the case when `fillstyle` is set to `'none'`.
5. Below is the corrected version of the `_recache` function:

### Corrected Version:
```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    self._filled = self._fillstyle != 'none'
    self._marker_function()
```

By setting `_filled` based on the `fillstyle` attribute of the `MarkerStyle` object, it correctly handles the case when `fillstyle` is `'none'`. This change should resolve the issue reported in GitHub and make the failing test pass.
