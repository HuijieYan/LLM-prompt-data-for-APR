### Analysis:
The `_recache` function is called when a new marker style is created or updated. It resets various attributes of the MarkerStyle object. The failing test is checking whether the marker is filled or not, but it is failing due to incorrect behavior of the `_recache` function.

### Identified Bug:
The bug lies in the `_recache` function where `self._filled` is always set to `True`, regardless of the actual fill style specified. This is causing the failing test to assert `not True` and fail.

### Cause of the Bug:
The `_recache` function inappropriately sets `self._filled = True` unconditionally, which doesn't reflect the fill style specified in the MarkerStyle. This leads to incorrect fill behavior when checking if the marker is filled or not.

### Proposed Fix:
We need to update the `_recache` function to correctly set the `self._filled` attribute based on the fill style specified in the MarkerStyle object.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    self._filled = self.get_fillstyle() != 'none'  # Check the fill style
    self._marker_function()
```

In the corrected version, the `_filled` attribute is set based on the fill style specified in the MarkerStyle object using the `get_fillstyle()` method. This change ensures that the marker fill behavior is correctly determined.

After applying this fix, the failing test should pass successfully.
