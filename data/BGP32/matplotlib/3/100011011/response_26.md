### Analysis:
The current `_recache` function does not properly handle the case where `self._marker_function` is called. This results in the attributes not being correctly updated, leading to incorrect marker styles as seen in the failing test. The failing test specifically checks if a marker style is filled or not, and it fails due to the incorrect implementation of `_recache`.

### Bug Explanation:
The current implementation of `_recache` does not correctly update the `_filled` attribute when `_marker_function` is called. As a result, the `is_filled` method returns `True` when it should be returning `False`, leading to the failing test. The bug is causing the markers to be filled when the expectation is for them to be hollow.

### Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the `_filled` attribute is correctly updated based on the marker style settings. This can be achieved by checking the marker style's fillstyle when `_marker_function` is called. If the fillstyle is set to `'none'`, then `_filled` should be set to `False`.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    
    # Check if fillstyle is set to 'none'
    if self.get_fillstyle() == 'none':
        self._filled = False
    else:
        self._filled = True
        
    self._marker_function()
```

By checking the fillstyle and updating the `_filled` attribute accordingly, the corrected version of the `_recache` function should now handle the marker styles correctly, including setting markers to be hollow when the fillstyle is set to `'none'`. This fix should resolve the failing test and also address the issue reported on GitHub.
