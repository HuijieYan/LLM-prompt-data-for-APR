### Analysis:
1. The `_recache` function sets various attributes back to their default values, and then calls the `_marker_function` which might be responsible for updating the marker style based on the other attributes. In this case, the issue seems to be with the `_filled` attribute being set back to `True` unconditionally, leading to markers not being hollow when `fillstyle='none'`.
   
2. The failing test is checking if the marker is filled or not but due to the `_filled` attribute being set to `True` always, it fails.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is caused by unconditionally setting `_filled` to `True` in the `_recache` function, which overrides the provided `fillstyle='none'` when creating a `MarkerStyle` object. This leads to markers not being hollow as intended.

### Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to update the `_recache` function to respect the `fillstyle='none'` attribute and adjust the `_filled` attribute accordingly.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    self._filled = False if self._fillstyle == 'none' else True  # Update _filled based on fillstyle
    self._marker_function()
```

In the corrected version, the `_filled` attribute is updated based on the `fillstyle` provided when creating the `MarkerStyle` object. This change ensures that markers will be hollow when `fillstyle='none'` is specified.

After applying this fix, the failing test should pass and the markers should appear hollow when using `fillstyle='none'` with the `MarkerStyle`.
