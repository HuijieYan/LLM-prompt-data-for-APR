### Analysis:
The buggy function `_recache` is setting `_filled` to `True` unconditionally, which causes an issue when trying to create a hollow marker by setting the `fillstyle='none'`. This is evident from the failing test where `marker_style.is_filled()` returns `True` even though `fillstyle='none'`.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is caused by the `_recache` function unconditionally setting `_filled` to `True`, which overrides the desired behavior of having a hollow marker when `fillstyle='none'` is set.

### Bug Fix:
To fix the bug, we need to adjust the `_recache` function to update the `_filled` attribute based on the value of `fillstyle` in the `MarkerStyle`. If `fillstyle` is set to `'none'`, then `_filled` should be set to `False` to create a hollow marker.

### Corrected Version:
```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: lib/matplotlib/markers.py

# Corrected version of the buggy function
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    # Check fillstyle and set _filled accordingly
    if self._fillstyle == 'none':
        self._filled = False
    else:
        self._filled = True
    self._marker_function()
```

By updating the `_filled` attribute based on the `fillstyle` value in the `MarkerStyle` class, we can ensure that the markers are displayed correctly as either filled or hollow based on the user's input. This correction addresses the issue reported on GitHub and should resolve the failing test related to the `is_filled` method.
