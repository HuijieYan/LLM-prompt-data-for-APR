### Analysis:
The buggy function `_recache` is responsible for resetting various attributes of the `MarkerStyle` class to default values. In this case, the problem arises because the function is calling `self._marker_function()` after resetting the `_filled` attribute to `True`, causing the markers to always be filled regardless of the fillstyle set in `MarkerStyle`.

### Potential Error Location:
The issue lies in the order of operations within the `_recache` function. Calling `_marker_function()` after setting `_filled` to `True` overrides any attempt to set the fillstyle to `'none'`.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is causing the `is_filled()` method to always return `True` due to the `self._filled = True` assignment in the `_recache` function, resulting in filled markers even when `fillstyle='none'`.

### Fix Strategy:
1. Update the order of operations within `_recache` so that `_marker_function()` is called before setting `_filled` or update the logic in `_marker_function()` to respect the `fillstyle`.
2. Modify the logic in `_marker_function()` to handle the `fillstyle` attribute appropriately.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    self._marker_function()
    self._filled = False  # Update the filled attribute after calling _marker_fuction
``` 

By updating the `self._filled` attribute after calling `_marker_function()`, the corrected version ensures that the fillstyle specified in the `MarkerStyle` will be respected, fixing the issue mentioned in the GitHub report.
