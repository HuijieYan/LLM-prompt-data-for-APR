### Analysis:
The `_recache` function is supposed to recache the marker properties, but it fails to properly update the `_filled` attribute based on the marker style used. The failing test is checking for the filled status of the marker style, and it fails because the `_filled` attribute is hardcoded to `True`.

### Bug Cause:
The `_filled` attribute is always set to `True`, regardless of the actual fill style specified. This causes the `is_filled` method to always return `True`, leading to test failures when expecting markers to be unfilled.

### Bug Fix:
To fix the bug, the `_filled` attribute should be updated based on the fill style defined in the marker style. If the fill style is `'full'`, `_filled` should be `True`, and if the fill style is `'none'`, `_filled` should be `False`.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    self._filled = self.get_fillstyle() != 'none'
    self._marker_function()
```

By updating the `_filled` attribute based on the fill style specified in the `MarkerStyle`, the corrected version of the function should now properly indicate whether the marker is filled or not, allowing the test to pass as expected.
