### Analysis:
The buggy function `_recache` is supposed to update various attributes of a MarkerStyle object, such as `_path`, `_transform`, etc. However, the bug lies in the fact that the `_marker_function` is called after all the attribute assignment. This leads to unexpected behavior as seen in the failing test where `is_filled()` returns `True` instead of `False` when `fillstyle='none'`.

### Bug Cause:
The `_marker_function` should be called before updating the attributes to ensure that the correct values are set based on the marker style function.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
1. Call the `_marker_function` at the beginning of the `_recache` function before updating any attributes.
2. Ensure that the attributes are updated based on the marker function's settings.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    # Call the marker function to set markers specific attributes
    self._marker_function()
    
    # Now update the attributes based on the marker function
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    self._filled = self._get_fillstyle() != 'none'
```

By calling the `_marker_function` at the beginning of the `_recache` function, we ensure that the attributes are correctly set based on the marker style settings. This should resolve the issue reported in the GitHub bug and pass the failing test.
