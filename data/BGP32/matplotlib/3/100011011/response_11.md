### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_recache` is responsible for resetting various attributes of a `MarkerStyle` instance to default values, including `_path`, `_transform`, `_alt_path`, `_alt_transform`, `_snap_threshold`, `_joinstyle`, `_capstyle`, and `_filled`.
2. The error message indicates that the `is_filled` method of `MarkerStyle` is not behaving as expected, returning `True` when it should not.
3. Based on the runtime values and types provided, the `_filled` attribute is set to `True` within the `_recache` function, and this value might be causing the `is_filled` method to return `True` erroneously. This could lead to unexpected behavior when checking if the marker is filled.
4. To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the `_filled` attribute is correctly set based on the `fillstyle` parameter passed during the `MarkerStyle` initialization.
5. In the corrected version, we will update the `_recache` function to set the `_filled` attribute based on the `fillstyle` passed during `MarkerStyle` initialization.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    # Check if fillstyle is set to 'none' and update the _filled attribute accordingly
    if self.get_fillstyle() == 'none':
        self._filled = False
    else:
        self._filled = True
    self._marker_function()
```

By updating the `_recache` function to correctly set the `_filled` attribute based on the `fillstyle`, the bug should be fixed, and the test case related to `is_filled()` method should pass successfully.
