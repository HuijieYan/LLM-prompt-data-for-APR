### Analysis
- The `_recache` function initializes various attributes of a marker style object.
- The failing test is checking if the marker style is filled or not based on the `is_filled` method, but it fails.
- The runtime values show that `self._filled` is initialized to `True`.
- The GitHub issue describes a scenario where setting `fillstyle='none'` does not result in a hollow marker as expected.

### Bug Cause
- The bug is caused by the default initialization of `self._filled` to `True` in the `_recache` function, which contradicts the expectation of a hollow marker when `fillstyle='none'`.

### Fix Strategy
- Modify the initialization of `self._filled` based on the `fillstyle` parameter in the `MarkerStyle` object.

### Corrected Version
```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    self._filled = self.get_fillstyle() != 'none'  # Adjust filled based on fillstyle
    self._marker_function()
```

In the corrected version, the `_filled` attribute is set based on the value of `fillstyle` using the `get_fillstyle` method to ensure that a hollow marker is represented correctly.
