### Analyzing the buggy function and error message

The buggy function `_recache` sets certain attributes to default values and then calls the `_marker_function`, which is expected to be a method in the class. The failing test is related to the `is_filled` method, which should return the opposite boolean value of `_filled` attribute to check if the marker is filled or not.

The error message indicates that the `is_filled` method is evaluating to `True` when it should not. This suggests that the `_filled` attribute might not be correctly set to `False`. The failing test is checking if the marker style is not filled, but it's incorrectly evaluating to `True`.

### Identifying potential error locations

- The `_filled` attribute is being set to `True` initially in the `_recache` method, but the error seems related to it being evaluated incorrectly in the `is_filled` method.
- The call to `_marker_function` might be altering the value of `_filled` unexpectedly.

### Cause of the bug

The bug is likely caused by the `_marker_function` method changing the value of the `_filled` attribute incorrectly. Since `_filled` is set to `True` initially in `_recache`, any modifications in `_marker_function` that don't update `_filled` could lead to incorrect behavior.

### Suggested strategy for fixing the bug

To fix the bug, ensure that the `_filled` attribute is correctly set to `False` when the fillstyle is set to `'none'`. This can be achieved by updating the value of `_filled` based on the fillstyle passed during marker initialization.

### Corrected version of the function

Here is the corrected version of the `_recache` function:
```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    
    # Check if fillstyle is set to 'none' and update filled accordingly
    if self._fillstyle == 'none':
        self._filled = False
    else:
        self._filled = True
    
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    
    self._marker_function()
```

Ensure that the fillstyle is correctly checked and update the `_filled` attribute based on the fillstyle value. This correction should fix the bug and make the failing test pass.
