### Analysis:
1. The `_recache` function initializes various properties of the `MarkerStyle` object but doesn't correctly handle the `is_filled()` method, resulting in the failure of the `test_marker_fillstyle`.
2. The issue reported on GitHub indicates that setting the `fillstyle` to `'none'` does not make markers hollow as expected.
3. The runtime values show that the `self._filled` property is initialized to `True`, which is causing the unexpected behavior.
   
### Bug Cause:
The bug is caused by the `self._filled` property being set to `True` by default in the `_recache` function, which overrides the intention of making markers hollow when the `fillstyle` is set to `'none'`.

### Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug and enable markers to be hollow when `fillstyle` is set to `'none'`, we need to ensure that the `self._filled` property reflects the `fillstyle` specified by the user.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    self._filled = self._fillstyle != 'none'
    self._marker_function()
```

By updating the `_filled` property based on the `fillstyle` specified by the user, the corrected version ensures that markers are hollow when the `fillstyle` is set to `'none'. This fix addresses the reported issue on GitHub and allows the test case `test_marker_fillstyle` to pass successfully.
