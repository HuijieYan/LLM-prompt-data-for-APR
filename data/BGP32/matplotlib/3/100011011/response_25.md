### Analysis:
The buggy function `_recache` seems to reset certain attributes of the `MarkerStyle` instance to default values and then calls a `_marker_function`. In the failing test scenario, the issue is related to the `is_filled` method not returning the expected value, causing the assertion error.

### Error Cause:
The `is_filled` method doesn't correctly check for the filled status of the marker based on the `_filled` attribute being set to `True` in the `_recache` function. This leads to incorrect behavior and the failing test.

### Fix Strategy:
1. Update the `is_filled` method to correctly return the value of the `_filled` attribute.
2. Ensure that the `_filled` attribute gets updated correctly when `fillstyle` is set to `'none'` during initialization.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    self._filled = True
    self._marker_function()

# Update the is_filled method
def is_filled(self):
    return self._filled

# Update MarkerStyle constructor to set _filled based on fillstyle
class MarkerStyle:
    def __init__(self, marker='o', fillstyle='full'):
        self._marker = marker
        self._fillstyle = fillstyle
        self._filled = fillstyle != 'none'

    def get_fillstyle(self):
        return self._fillstyle

    def is_filled(self):
        return self._filled
```

By updating the `is_filled` method to correctly reflect the `_filled` attribute and ensuring that `_filled` is set based on the `fillstyle` parameter during initialization, the corrected version should resolve the issue reported in GitHub and pass the failing test.
