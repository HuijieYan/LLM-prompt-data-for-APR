## Analysis:
The buggy function `_recache` is failing to properly update the `_filled` attribute when setting the fillstyle to 'none'. This leads to the `is_filled` method returning `True` incorrectly when it should return `False`.

The issue reported on GitHub reflects the exact problem where the markers are not displaying as hollow when using `fillstyle='none'`, which confirms that the bug is related to the fillstyle not being handled correctly.

## Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, the `_filled` attribute needs to be updated based on the fillstyle set in the MarkerStyle object. When the fillstyle is 'none', `_filled` should be set to `False` to ensure the marker is displayed as hollow.

## The corrected version of the function:

```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    
    # Update _filled based on fillstyle value
    if self.fillstyle == 'none':
        self._filled = False
    else:
        self._filled = True
    
    self._marker_function()
```

By adding the check for fillstyle value inside the `_recache` function and appropriately updating the `_filled` attribute, the bug causing the markers not to display as hollow when fillstyle is set to 'none' should be resolved.
