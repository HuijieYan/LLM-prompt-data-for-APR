### Analyzing the Bug and Error Message
The buggy function `_recache` sets default values for various attributes used in markers in Matplotlib. The failing test `test_marker_fillstyle` checks if a marker with fill style set to 'none' is considered as not filled. The error message shows that the assertion `assert not marker_style.is_filled()` fails, indicating a problem with the `is_filled` method of `MarkerStyle`.

### Potential Error Location
The `is_filled` method implementation within the `MarkerStyle` class might be the potential error location causing the test failure.

### Cause of the Bug
The bug is likely caused by the incorrect implementation of the `is_filled` method in the `MarkerStyle` class. Since the fill style is set to 'none', the `is_filled` method should return False, but it seems to be returning True incorrectly based on the error message and assertion failure.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug
To fix the bug, the `is_filled` method of the `MarkerStyle` class needs to be updated to properly handle the 'none' fill style and return False when it's set. This adjustment will align the behavior with the expected outcome of the failing test.

### Corrected Version
```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    self._filled = True
    if self.get_fillstyle() == 'none':
        self._filled = False
    self._marker_function()
``` 

In the corrected version, we check the fill style of the `MarkerStyle` object inside the `_recache` function and update the `_filled` attribute accordingly. This change ensures that the `is_filled` method will correctly reflect the fill style set for the marker, resolving the issue reported on GitHub.
