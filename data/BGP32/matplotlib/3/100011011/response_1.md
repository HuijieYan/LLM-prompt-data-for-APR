### Analysis:
The buggy function `_recache` sets the default values for various attributes but fails to execute `_marker_function`, which is crucial for initializing the marker style. This leads to incorrect behavior when checking if the marker is filled or not, causing the failing test.

### Error Cause:
The buggy function does not call the `_marker_function` after setting default values, resulting in an incomplete marker style initialization.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that `_marker_function` is called after setting default values for the marker style attributes.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = 0.0
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    self._filled = True
    self._marker_function()
``` 

With this correction, the `_marker_function` will be executed after setting default values, ensuring proper initialization of the marker style. This should resolve the issue and pass the failing test.
