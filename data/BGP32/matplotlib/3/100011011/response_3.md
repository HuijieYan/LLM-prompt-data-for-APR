### Analysis:
The bug is occurring because the `is_filled` method is not implemented correctly, leading to the assertion error in the failing test. The `is_filled` method is expected to return `True` if the marker is filled and `False` if it is hollow based on the provided `fillstyle` parameter.

### Bug Location:
The bug is located in the implementation of the `is_filled` method in the `MarkerStyle` class.

### Cause of the Bug:
- In the failing test, the `is_filled` method is returning `<bound method MarkerStyle.is_filled ...>`, which indicates that the method is not functioning as intended.
- The cause of the bug is within the implementation of the `is_filled` method itself, which is not correctly checking the `fillstyle` parameter to determine if the marker is filled or not.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
- Modify the `is_filled` method to correctly check the `fillstyle` parameter and return `True` if the marker is filled and `False` if it is hollow.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    self._filled = self._get_fillstyle() != 'none'
    self._marker_function()
    
def is_filled(self):
    return self._filled

def _get_fillstyle(self):
    return self._fillstyle
```

By implementing the `is_filled` method correctly and adding a `_get_fillstyle` method to retrieve the `fillstyle` parameter, the bug of markers not being hollow when `fillstyle='none'` should be resolved.
