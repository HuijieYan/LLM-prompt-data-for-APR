## Analysis
The error message indicates that the `is_filled()` method is returning `True`, which is causing the test to fail. This behavior is unexpected when the `fillstyle` is set to `'none'`.

Looking at the `_recache()` function, it seems that the `_filled` attribute is always set to `True` regardless of the `fillstyle` being set to `'none'`. This inconsistency is likely causing the issue.

## Bug Cause
The bug is caused by the `_filled` attribute being set to `True` by default, even when `fillstyle` is explicitly set to `'none'`. This leads to the `is_filled()` method returning `True`, which is incorrect behavior when the marker is supposed to be hollow ('none' fillstyle).

## Fix Strategy
To fix this bug, we need to update the `_filled` attribute based on the `fillstyle` parameter. If `fillstyle` is set to `'none'`, then `_filled` should be set to `False`. This adjustment will ensure that the `is_filled()` method correctly reflects the desired fillstyle.

## Corrected Code
```python
# The corrected version of the _recache() function
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    self._filled = 'none' not in self.get_fillstyle()
    self._marker_function()
```

By updating the `_filled` attribute based on the `fillstyle` parameter, we ensure that the marker is correctly identified as filled or hollow, addressing the issue mentioned in the failing test and the GitHub report.
