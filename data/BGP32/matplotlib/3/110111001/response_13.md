### Analysis
The buggy function `_recache` in the `MarkerStyle` class is not properly handling the case where the `_marker_function` is not `None`. It incorrectly sets the attributes without invoking the `_marker_function` which may lead to incorrect values and unexpected behavior.

### Bug Cause
The bug causes the `MarkerStyle` object to have attributes set without the intended transformation or path based on the marker function.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that when `_marker_function` is not `None`, it is called to properly set the attributes of the `MarkerStyle` object.

### The corrected version of the buggy function
```python
class MarkerStyle():
    def _recache(self):
        if self._marker_function is not None:
            self._marker_function()
        else:
            self._path = _empty_path
            self._transform = IdentityTransform()
            self._alt_path = None
            self._alt_transform = None
            self._snap_threshold = None
            self._joinstyle = 'round'
            self._capstyle = 'butt'
            self._filled = True
``` 

By modifying the `_recache` function as shown above, we ensure that when `_marker_function` is not `None`, it is called to set the attributes correctly, resolving the bug in the `MarkerStyle` class.
