### Analysis
The failing test `test_marker_fillstyle()` is checking if the marker style is not filled after setting `fillstyle='none'`. The failing assert statement `assert not marker_style.is_filled()` indicates that the `is_filled()` method is returning `True` instead of `False`.

### Bug Cause
In the `_recache()` method, the `_marker_function()` is called after setting the `_filled` attribute to `True`. This leads to the `is_filled()` method returning `True` even though `fillstyle='none'` was set in the test.

### Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, the `_marker_function()` should be called before setting the `_filled` attribute to ensure that the correct fill style setting is reflected in the `is_filled()` method.

### Corrected Version
```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: lib/matplotlib/markers.py

class MarkerStyle():
    def _recache(self):
        if self._marker_function is None:
            return
        self._marker_function()
        self._path = _empty_path
        self._transform = IdentityTransform()
        self._alt_path = None
        self._alt_transform = None
        self._snap_threshold = None
        self._joinstyle = 'round'
        self._capstyle = 'butt'
        self._filled = True
