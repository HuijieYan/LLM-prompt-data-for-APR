The issue in the buggy function `_recache` is that it tries to call `self._marker_function()` without prior initialization of `_marker_function`, leading to the failure in the test due to the absence of the required functionality.

### Cause of the bug:
1. The `_recache` function checks if `_marker_function` is `None` before proceeding. In this case, `_marker_function` is not initialized yet.
2. When `_marker_function` is not defined, the function should exit early to avoid calling an undefined function.

### Strategy for fixing the bug:
1. Update the `_recache` function to check if `_marker_function` is not `None` before trying to call it.
2. If `_marker_function` is not defined, simply return without proceeding further.

### Corrected version of the `_recache` function:
```python
# The corrected version of the buggy function
class MarkerStyle():
    def _recache(self):
        if self._marker_function is None:
            return
        self._path = _empty_path
        self._transform = IdentityTransform()
        self._alt_path = None
        self._alt_transform = None
        self._snap_threshold = None
        self._joinstyle = 'round'
        self._capstyle = 'butt'
        self._filled = True
        self._marker_function()
``` 

By making this change, the `_recache` function will now avoid calling an undefined function when `_marker_function` is not initialized, fixing the issue identified in the failing test.
