### Analysis and Explanation
The failing test `test_marker_fillstyle` is asserting that `marker_style.is_filled()` should return `False`, but it seems like the `is_filled()` method is not correctly implemented or assigned in the `_recache` function.

In the `_recache` function, even though `self._filled` is set to `True`, there is no assignment or implementation for the `is_filled()` method. This results in the assertion error since the method is not returning the expected value.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix this bug, we need to implement the `is_filled()` method in the `MarkerStyle` class to correctly reflect the `_filled` attribute. We can implement the method to simply return the `_filled` attribute value.

### Corrected Version
```python
# The corrected version with the bug fixed
class MarkerStyle():

    def _recache(self):
        if self._marker_function is None:
            return
        self._path = _empty_path
        self._transform = IdentityTransform()
        self._alt_path = None
        self._alt_transform = None
        self._snap_threshold = None
        self._joinstyle = 'round'
        self._capstyle = 'butt'
        self._filled = True
        self._marker_function()
    
    def is_filled(self):
        return self._filled
```

By adding the `is_filled()` method to the `MarkerStyle` class that returns the `_filled` attribute value, the corrected version should now pass the failing test.
