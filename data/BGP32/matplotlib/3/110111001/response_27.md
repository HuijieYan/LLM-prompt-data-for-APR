### Buggy Function Analysis
The `_recache` function in the `MarkerStyle` class is intended to reinitialize various attributes when triggered. However, the issue lies in the line `self._marker_function()` where it attempts to call a method that is not defined within the provided code snippet. This results in an AttributeError when the failing test tries to access the `is_filled` method.

### Bug Explanation
The `MarkerStyle` class lacks a defined `is_filled` method, which causes the failing test to raise an AssertionError when it tries to access this non-existent method. As a result, the test fails and provides an error message indicating that the `is_filled` method is missing.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix this bug, we need to define the missing `is_filled` method within the `MarkerStyle` class. The method should return the value of the `_filled` attribute which determines whether the marker is filled or not. Additionally, we need to ensure that the `_marker_function` attribute is properly set within the class initialization or `_recache` method.

### Corrected Version
```python
# The corrected version of the buggy function
class MarkerStyle():

    def __init__(self, **kwargs):
        self._marker_function = None
        self._recache()

    def _recache(self):
        if self._marker_function is None:
            return
        self._path = _empty_path
        self._transform = IdentityTransform()
        self._alt_path = None
        self._alt_transform = None
        self._snap_threshold = None
        self._joinstyle = 'round'
        self._capstyle = 'butt'
        self._filled = True
        self._marker_function()

    def is_filled(self):
        return self._filled
```

By adding the `is_filled` method to the `MarkerStyle` class, the corrected version now properly returns the value of the `_filled` attribute. This change should resolve the failing test and eliminate the AttributeError.
