### Analysis:
The failing test is checking the `is_filled()` method of the `MarkerStyle` class, but the `is_filled()` method is not implemented in the class. This results in the test failing with the error message indicating that the method is not found.

### Bug Explanation:
The `_recache` function is initializing various attributes of the `MarkerStyle` class but is missing the implementation of the `is_filled()` method. This causes the test to fail when trying to call `is_filled()`.

### Bug Fix:
To fix the bug, we need to implement the `is_filled()` method in the `MarkerStyle` class.

### Corrected Version:
Here is the corrected version of the `MarkerStyle` class with the `is_filled()` method implemented:

```python
# The corrected version of the MarkerStyle class
class MarkerStyle():
    
    def __init__(self, marker=None, fillstyle=None):
        self.marker = marker
        self.fillstyle = fillstyle
        self._recache()

    def _recache(self):
        if self._marker_function is None:
            return
        self._path = _empty_path
        self._transform = IdentityTransform()
        self._alt_path = None
        self._alt_transform = None
        self._snap_threshold = None
        self._joinstyle = 'round'
        self._capstyle = 'butt'
        self._filled = True
        self._marker_function()

    def _marker_function(self):
        # Implementation of the marker function
        pass

    def is_filled(self):
        return self._filled

    def get_fillstyle(self):
        return self.fillstyle
```

Now, with the `is_filled()` method implemented, the failing test should pass successfully.
