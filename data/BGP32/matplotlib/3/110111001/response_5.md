### Analysis:
In the provided buggy function `_recache`, we can see that the `_marker_function` is being called without checking its existence, leading to potential issues if `_marker_function` is not defined properly.

### Error cause:
The failing test `test_marker_fillstyle` creates a `MarkerStyle` object with a marker specified as 'o' and fillstyle as 'none'. The test then asserts that the `is_filled` method of the `MarkerStyle` object returns `False`. However, since `_marker_function` is called unconditionally in the `_recache` function, it might set `_filled` to `True`, causing the `is_filled` method to return `True` instead of `False`.

### Strategy for fixing the bug:
1. Check if `_marker_function` is not None before calling it in the `_recache` function.
2. Update the `_filled` attribute based on the `fillstyle` value passed during the `MarkerStyle` object creation.

### Corrected version of the function:
```python
class MarkerStyle():
    def _recache(self):
        if self._marker_function is None:
            return
        self._path = _empty_path
        self._transform = IdentityTransform()
        self._alt_path = None
        self._alt_transform = None
        self._snap_threshold = None
        self._joinstyle = 'round'
        self._capstyle = 'butt'
        self._filled = self.get_fillstyle() != 'none'
        self._marker_function()
```

By updating the `_filled` attribute based on the `fillstyle` value, the corrected version ensures that the `is_filled` method will return the correct value according to the fillstyle specified during object creation. This should resolve the failing test case.
