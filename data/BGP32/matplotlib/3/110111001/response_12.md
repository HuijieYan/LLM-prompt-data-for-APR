### Analysis
The failing test is checking the `is_filled()` method of the `MarkerStyle` class but the `is_filled()` method is not defined in the provided buggy code. This is causing the assertion error in the test.

### Bug Explanation
The `is_filled()` method is called in the failing test but not defined in the `MarkerStyle` class. Since it's missing, the test fails with an assertion error.

### Bug Fix
To fix the bug, we need to add the `is_filled()` method to the `MarkerStyle` class. Below is the corrected version of the `MarkerStyle` class with the added `is_filled()` method.

```python
# The corrected version of the buggy function
class MarkerStyle():

    def _recache(self):
        if self._marker_function is None:
            return
        self._path = _empty_path
        self._transform = IdentityTransform()
        self._alt_path = None
        self._alt_transform = None
        self._snap_threshold = None
        self._joinstyle = 'round'
        self._capstyle = 'butt'
        self._filled = True
        self._marker_function()
    
    def is_filled(self):
        return self._filled
```

By adding the `is_filled()` method to the `MarkerStyle` class, the provided failing test should now pass without any assertion errors.
