### Explanation:
The failing test is checking the `is_filled()` method of the `MarkerStyle` object, which is expected to return `False` since the `filled` attribute is set to `True` in the `_recache` function. However, the failing test is asserting that it should be `False`, indicating that the `_recache` function is not properly setting the `filled` attribute to `True`.

### Bug:
The bug is in the `_recache` function where the `_filled` attribute is being set to `True` instead of the opposite.

### Fix:
To fix the bug, we need to set the `_filled` attribute to `False` in the `_recache` function.

### Corrected Version:
```python
class MarkerStyle():
    def _recache(self):
        if self._marker_function is None:
            return
        self._path = _empty_path
        self._transform = IdentityTransform()
        self._alt_path = None
        self._alt_transform = None
        self._snap_threshold = None
        self._joinstyle = 'round'
        self._capstyle = 'butt'
        self._filled = False  # Set _filled to False
        self._marker_function()
``` 

By making this change, the `_recache` function will properly set the `_filled` attribute to `False`, fixing the bug and ensuring that the failing test will pass.
