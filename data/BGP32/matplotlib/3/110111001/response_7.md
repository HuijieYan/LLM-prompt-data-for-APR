### Bug Explanation
The failing test `test_marker_fillstyle` fails because the `MarkerStyle` class does not have an `is_filled` method defined. The assertion `assert not marker_style.is_filled()` is expecting the `MarkerStyle` class to have an `is_filled` method, which is missing, leading to the test failure.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix this bug, we need to add an `is_filled` method to the `MarkerStyle` class that returns the `_filled` attribute.

### Corrected Version of the Buggy Function
```python
class MarkerStyle:
    def _recache(self):
        if self._marker_function is None:
            return
        self._path = _empty_path
        self._transform = IdentityTransform()
        self._alt_path = None
        self._alt_transform = None
        self._snap_threshold = None
        self._joinstyle = 'round'
        self._capstyle = 'butt'
        self._filled = True
        self._marker_function()
    
    def is_filled(self):
        return self._filled
```

By including the `is_filled` method in the `MarkerStyle` class as shown above, the corrected function will pass the failing test `test_marker_fillstyle`.
