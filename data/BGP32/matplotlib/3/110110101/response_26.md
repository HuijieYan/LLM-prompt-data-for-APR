## Analysis
1. The `MarkerStyle` class has a `_recache` function that is meant to recalculate certain attributes when called.
2. The function currently sets some attributes to default values and then calls `_marker_function` method, which causes the test to fail as it expects the `filled` attribute to be `False`.
3. The error message indicates that the `is_filled` method is returning `True` instead of `False`, leading to the assertion error.
4. To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the `filled` attribute is set correctly to `False` during the recaching process.
5. We need to update the `_recache` function to set the `filled` attribute to `False` explicitly.

## Bug Fix
```python
class MarkerStyle():
    def _recache(self):
        if self._marker_function is None:
            return
        self._path = _empty_path
        self._transform = IdentityTransform()
        self._alt_path = None
        self._alt_transform = None
        self._snap_threshold = None
        self._joinstyle = 'round'
        self._capstyle = 'butt'
        self._filled = False  # Fix: Setting filled attribute to False
        self._marker_function()
```

By explicitly setting the `self._filled` attribute to `False` in the `_recache` function, the bug causing the failing test to assert `True` instead of `False` should be resolved. This fix aligns the expected behavior with the test case's expectations.
