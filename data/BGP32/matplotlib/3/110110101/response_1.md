### Analysis
The `_recache` function in the `MarkerStyle` class is supposed to recompute certain attributes of a marker style. However, in its current buggy state, it tries to call an undefined `_marker_function` attribute, leading to a `TypeError` when trying to execute `self._marker_function()`.

### Bug Location
The `_recache` function is missing necessary attributes and logic to achieve its intended purpose. The `self._marker_function` attribute is not properly defined or initialized.

### Bug Explanation
The failing test is trying to check if the marker style is filled, but due to the missing `_marker_function` attribute and improper initialization of other attributes, it fails to determine if the marker style is filled or not. As a result, the test fails with the error message indicating that the method `is_filled` is returning `True`.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to define and initialize the necessary attributes within the `_recache` function so that it can properly recompute the marker style attributes. We can remove the dependency on `_marker_function` and directly set the `self._filled` attribute based on the `self._fillstyle` attribute.

### Corrected Version
```python
class MarkerStyle():
    def _recache(self):
        if self._fillstyle == 'none':
            self._filled = False
        else:
            self._filled = True
        self._path = _empty_path
        self._transform = IdentityTransform()
        self._alt_path = None
        self._alt_transform = None
        self._snap_threshold = float('inf')
        self._joinstyle = 'round'
        self._capstyle = 'butt'
``` 

By updating the `_recache` function as shown above, we set the `self._filled` attribute based on the `self._fillstyle` attribute, ensuring that the marker style is correctly determined to be filled or not.
