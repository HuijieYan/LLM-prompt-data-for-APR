## Correction

The issue in the `_recache` function is that it is calling `self._marker_function()` without checking if `_marker_function` exists. This is causing the function to fail when trying to call a non-existing method `_marker_function`.

To fix this bug, we need to add a check to ensure that `_marker_function` is not `None` before trying to call it.

Here is the corrected version of the `_recache` function:

```python
# The declaration of the class containing the corrected function
class MarkerStyle():
    
    def _recache(self):
        if self._marker_function is None:
            return
        
        self._path = _empty_path
        self._transform = IdentityTransform()
        self._alt_path = None
        self._alt_transform = None
        self._snap_threshold = float('inf')
        self._joinstyle = 'round'
        self._capstyle = 'butt'
        self._filled = False  # Corrected the default value to False
        self._marker_function()
```

With this correction, the function will first check if `_marker_function` is not `None` before attempting to call it, preventing the error encountered during the failing test.
