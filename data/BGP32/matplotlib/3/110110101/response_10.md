## Analysis
The buggy function `_recache` in the `MarkerStyle` class is failing because it is trying to call `self._marker_function()` without checking if it is defined or not. This results in an AttributeError when trying to call a function that does not exist.

## Bug Cause
The buggy function is trying to call `self._marker_function()` directly without considering if it exists or not, leading to the error when it doesn't exist.

## Fix Strategy
We need to check if `self._marker_function` is not None before calling it.

## The corrected version of the function
```python
class MarkerStyle:

    def _recache(self):
        if self._marker_function is None:
            return
        
        self._path = _empty_path
        self._transform = IdentityTransform()
        self._alt_path = None
        self._alt_transform = None
        self._snap_threshold = np.inf
        self._joinstyle = 'round'
        self._capstyle = 'butt'
        self._filled = False
        self._marker_function()
```

By adding the check `if self._marker_function is None: return` before calling `self._marker_function()`, we prevent the AttributeError from occurring. This corrected version should pass the failing test and provide the expected output values.
