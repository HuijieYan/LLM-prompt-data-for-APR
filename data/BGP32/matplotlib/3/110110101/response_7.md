### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_recache` in the `MarkerStyle` class is supposed to recache some attributes related to marker style. However, it fails to correctly handle the `self._filled` attribute when the condition `if self._marker_function is None` is met.
2. The failing test is checking the `is_filled()` method of the `MarkerStyle` class which relies on the correct initialization of the `_filled` attribute.
3. The error message indicates that the `is_filled()` method is returning `True` when it should be returning `False`. This discrepancy is likely due to the incorrect initialization of the `_filled` attribute in `_recache`.
4. To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the `_filled` attribute is set to the correct value based on the `fillstyle` parameter provided during the initialization.

### Bug Fix:
```python
class MarkerStyle():
    def __init__(self, marker=None, fillstyle='full'):
        self._marker_function = None
        self._fillstyle = fillstyle
        self._recache()

    def _recache(self):
        if self._marker_function is None:
            return
        self._path = _empty_path
        self._transform = IdentityTransform()
        self._alt_path = None
        self._alt_transform = None
        self._snap_threshold = None
        self._joinstyle = 'round'
        self._capstyle = 'butt'
        self._filled = self._fillstyle != 'none'
        self._marker_function()
    
    def is_filled(self):
        return self._filled
```

By updating the `_filled` attribute based on the `fillstyle` parameter during initialization, the corrected version of the `MarkerStyle` class should now return the expected results when tested with the provided failing test.
