## Analysis
The buggy function `_recache` is called when `MarkerStyle` is initialized with a `marker_function`. The issue lies in the line `self._marker_function()` where it is called without checking if it exists. This leads to an error when `_marker_function` is `None`.

## Bug Cause
The bug is being caused by calling `_marker_function` without checking if it exists or not. This leads to an error when `_marker_function` is `None`. In the failing test, the `_marker_function` is never defined or set, so it remains `None`.

## Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to add a check to ensure that `_marker_function` exists before calling it in the `_recache` function.

## The corrected version of the buggy function

```python
class MarkerStyle():
    def _recache(self):
        if self._marker_function is not None:
            self._path = _empty_path
            self._transform = IdentityTransform()
            self._alt_path = None
            self._alt_transform = None
            self._snap_threshold = None
            self._joinstyle = 'round'
            self._capstyle = 'butt'
            self._filled = True
            self._marker_function()
```

With this correction, the `_marker_function` will only be called if it exists, which will prevent the error encountered in the failing test.
