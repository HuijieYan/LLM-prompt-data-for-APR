## Plan for fixing the bug:
1. The bug occurs because the `_filled` attribute is being set to `True` unconditionally, regardless of the `fillstyle` specified during the MarkerStyle initialization.
2. To fix the bug, we need to update the `_filled` attribute based on the `fillstyle` set during initialization.
3. We can achieve this by modifying the `_recache` function to consider the `fillstyle` parameter and adjust the `_filled` attribute accordingly.

## The corrected version of the buggy function:
```python
class MarkerStyle():
    def _recache(self):
        if self._marker_function is None:
            return
        self._path = _empty_path
        self._transform = IdentityTransform()
        self._alt_path = None
        self._alt_transform = None
        self._snap_threshold = None
        self._joinstyle = 'round'
        self._capstyle = 'butt'
        self._filled = self._fillstyle != 'none'  # Update _filled based on fillstyle
        self._marker_function()
```

By updating the `_filled` attribute based on the `fillstyle` parameter during the initialization, the corrected function will set `_filled` to `False` when `fillstyle` is `'none'`, and set it to `True` otherwise. This adjustment will ensure that the test case `test_marker_fillstyle` passes as expected.
