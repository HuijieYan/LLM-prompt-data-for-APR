## Analysis
The `_recache` function in the `MarkerStyle` class is supposed to recalculate certain attributes when called. However, the bug lies in the line `self._marker_function()` where it tries to call a function that might be missing.

## Bug Explanation
1. The function `_recache` in the `MarkerStyle` class is intended to perform certain recalculations.
2. The failing test attempts to check if the marker style is not filled after setting the fill style to 'none'.
3. The failing test fails because the `_marker_function` that should be called in `_recache` is missing, causing the function to terminate early without updating necessary attributes.
4. As a result, the expected value of `marker_style.is_filled()` is `False`, but the actual value is not updated and remains `True` due to the unexecuted `_marker_function`.

## Bug Fix Strategy
We need to ensure that the function `_marker_function` is properly defined and called within the `_recache` function. By ensuring that the `_marker_function` is called, the necessary attributes will be updated correctly.

## The corrected version of the function

```python
class MarkerStyle():
    def _recache(self):
        if self._marker_function is None:
            return
        self._path = _empty_path
        self._transform = IdentityTransform()
        self._alt_path = None
        self._alt_transform = None
        self._snap_threshold = np.inf
        self._joinstyle = 'round'
        self._capstyle = 'butt'
        self._filled = False
        self._marker_function()
```

By updating the `_recache` function as shown above, we ensure that when called, it will correctly update the necessary attributes and the failing test should pass successfully.
