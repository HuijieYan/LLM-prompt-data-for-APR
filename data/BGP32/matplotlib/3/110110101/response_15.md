Based on the error message and the failing test provided, it seems that the `is_filled()` method is not returning the expected value of `False`. The bug is likely in the implementation of the `is_filled()` method in the `MarkerStyle` class.

To fix this bug, we need to update the implementation of the `is_filled()` method in the `MarkerStyle` class to return the correct value.

Here is the corrected version of the `MarkerStyle` class with the updated `is_filled()` method:

```python
class MarkerStyle():

    def _recache(self):
        if self._marker_function is None:
            return
        self._path = _empty_path
        self._transform = IdentityTransform()
        self._alt_path = None
        self._alt_transform = None
        self._snap_threshold = None
        self._joinstyle = 'round'
        self._capstyle = 'butt'
        self._filled = True
        self._marker_function()
    
    def is_filled(self):
        return self._filled
```

With this correction, the `is_filled()` method should now correctly return `True` or `False` based on the `_filled` attribute of the `MarkerStyle` instance. This fix should make the failing test pass as expected.
