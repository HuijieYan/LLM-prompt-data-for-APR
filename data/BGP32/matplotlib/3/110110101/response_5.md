## Analysis
The `_recache` function in the `MarkerStyle` class is failing to properly set the `_filled` attribute based on the fillstyle provided. This is causing the `is_filled()` method to return the incorrect value, leading to the test failure.

## Potential Error Location
The issue lies in setting the `_filled` attribute based on the fillstyle provided.

## Cause of the Bug
The bug is caused by not updating the `_filled` attribute based on the `fillstyle` parameter provided during the initialization of the `MarkerStyle` object.

## Strategy for Fixing the Bug
To fix the bug, we need to update the `_filled` attribute based on the `fillstyle` parameter provided during the object initialization. We can set `_filled` to `False` when `fillstyle` is set to `'none'`.

## Corrected Version of the Function

```python
# The corrected _recache function
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    self._filled = self._fillstyle != 'none'
    self._marker_function()
```

By updating the `_filled` attribute based on the `fillstyle` parameter, we ensure that the `is_filled()` method will return the correct value based on the provided fill style.
