## Analysis
The buggy function `_recache` in the `MarkerStyle` class is intended to reset some internal attributes to default values. However, the bug occurs when trying to call `self._marker_function()` without first checking if it exists. This leads to an AttributeError when the function is called with no default marker function set.

## Bug Explanation
The bug occurs because the `_marker_function` attribute might not be set initially, causing the function to fail when it tries to call a non-existent function. This results in an AttributeError when trying to execute `self._marker_function()`.

## Bug Fix
To fix the bug, we need to check if `self._marker_function` is not `None` before attempting to call it. This way, we avoid the AttributeError by verifying the existence of the function before invoking it.

## Corrected Version
```python
class MarkerStyle():
    def _recache(self):
        if self._marker_function is not None:
            self._path = _empty_path
            self._transform = IdentityTransform()
            self._alt_path = None
            self._alt_transform = None
            self._snap_threshold = None
            self._joinstyle = 'round'
            self._capstyle = 'butt'
            self._filled = True
            self._marker_function()
```
