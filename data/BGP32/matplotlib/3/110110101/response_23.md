## Analysis
The buggy function `_recache` is supposed to reinitialize internal attributes based on the value of `_marker_function`, but it is not correctly handling all the attributes that need to be reset. In the failing test `test_marker_fillstyle`, when checking `marker_style.is_filled()`, it fails because the `_filled` attribute is not being set to `False` as expected.

## Bug
The bug in the current `_recache` function is that it sets `_filled` to `True` unconditionally at the end of the function, while it should be set based on the value of `fillstyle`.

## Fix
To fix the bug, we need to update the `_recache` function to set `_filled` based on the `fillstyle` attribute. If `fillstyle` is `'none'`, then `_filled` should be set to `False`.

## The corrected version of the function
```python
class MarkerStyle():
    def _recache(self):
        if self._marker_function is None:
            return
        self._path = _empty_path
        self._transform = IdentityTransform()
        self._alt_path = None
        self._alt_transform = None
        self._snap_threshold = None
        self._joinstyle = 'round'
        self._capstyle = 'butt'
        
        if self._fillstyle == 'none':
            self._filled = False
        else:
            self._filled = True
        
        self._marker_function()
``` 

Now, with this corrected version of the `_recache` function, the failing test `test_marker_fillstyle` should pass successfully.
