### Analysis
The buggy function `_recache` in the `MarkerStyle` class is supposed to recache the marker style attributes. The issue arises from the `_marker_function` method being called without checking if it is None or not. This leads to the failing test where the `is_filled` method returns `True`, but it should return `False` as specified.

### Bug
The bug occurs because the `_marker_function` is blindly called, which might set some attributes incorrectly, leading to incorrect results in subsequent checks like `is_filled()`.

### Fix
To fix the bug, we should check if `_marker_function` is not None before calling it. We can do this by adding a simple conditional check before invoking the `_marker_function` method.

### Corrected Version

```python
class MarkerStyle():

    def _recache(self):
        if self._marker_function is not None:
            self._path = _empty_path
            self._transform = IdentityTransform()
            self._alt_path = None
            self._alt_transform = None
            self._snap_threshold = float('inf')
            self._joinstyle = 'round'
            self._capstyle = 'butt'
            self._filled = True
            self._marker_function()
```

With this fix, the `_marker_function` will only be called if it is not None, preventing any unwanted side effects and ensuring that the marker style attributes are set correctly.
