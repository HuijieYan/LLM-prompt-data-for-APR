## Fixing the bug in the _recache function:

### Analysis:
The bug in the `_recache` function is that it fails to correctly set the `_filled` attribute based on the `fillstyle` parameter. The function should set `_filled` to `False` when the `fillstyle` is 'none' and `True` otherwise. This discrepancy causes the failing test on the `is_filled()` method.

### Bug Cause:
The bug occurs because the `_recache` function does not correctly handle the filling logic based on the `fillstyle` parameter passed to the `MarkerStyle` instance. As a result, the `_filled` attribute is always set to `True`, leading to the failing test.

### Bug Fix:
To fix the bug, we need to update the `_recache` function to correctly set the `_filled` attribute based on the `fillstyle` parameter. If the `fillstyle` is 'none', then `_filled` should be set to `False`, indicating that the marker should not be filled.

### Corrected version of the _recache function:
```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    self._filled = self._fillstyle != 'none'  # Set _filled based on fillstyle
    self._marker_function()
```

By updating the `_filled` attribute based on the `fillstyle` parameter, we ensure that the marker's filling behavior is correctly handled, which resolves the failing test scenario. This correction aligns the expected behavior with the test case, ensuring that the `is_filled()` method returns the correct value based on the `fillstyle` parameter.
