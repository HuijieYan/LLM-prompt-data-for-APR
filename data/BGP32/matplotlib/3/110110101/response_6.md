## Analysis
1. The buggy function `_recache` in the `MarkerStyle` class initializes some attributes of the class. It calls `self._marker_function()` without checking if it exists, which leads to an AttributeError when it is not defined.
2. The failing test `test_marker_fillstyle` is trying to assert that `marker_style.is_filled()` returns False, but due to the buggy function, it throws an AttributeError.
3. The error message highlights the failure in the assertion `assert not marker_style.is_filled()`. The expected return value in this case is False, but due to the bug, an AttributeError is raised.
4. To fix this bug, we need to ensure that `_marker_function` exists before attempting to call it in the `_recache` function.
5. I will add a check to see if `_marker_function` is not None before calling it.

## Corrected Version
```python
class MarkerStyle():

    def _recache(self):
        if self._marker_function is not None:
            self._path = _empty_path
            self._transform = IdentityTransform()
            self._alt_path = None
            self._alt_transform = None
            self._snap_threshold = float('inf')
            self._joinstyle = 'round'
            self._capstyle = 'butt'
            self._filled = True
            self._marker_function()
```

By adding the check `if self._marker_function is not None`, we ensure that the `_marker_function` is only called when it exists. This correction will prevent the AttributeError and allow the `MarkerStyle` class to function correctly.
