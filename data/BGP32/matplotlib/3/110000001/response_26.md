# Analysis:
The buggy function `_recache` in the `MarkerStyle` class is trying to call a `_marker_function` but there is no definition or assignment for `_marker_function`. This will result in an AttributeError when `_marker_function` is called.

# Identification of potential error locations:
1. The line `if self._marker_function is None:` checks if `_marker_function` is `None`, but it is not defined.
2. The line `self._marker_function()` tries to call `_marker_function` without checking or defining it.

# Cause of the bug:
The bug occurs because `_marker_function` is not defined in the `MarkerStyle` class, leading to an AttributeError when trying to call it.

# Strategy for fixing the bug:
To fix the bug, we need to define `_marker_function` in the `MarkerStyle` class or remove the unnecessary call if it is not needed.

# Corrected version of the function:
```python
# The corrected version of the buggy function
class MarkerStyle():
    def __init__(self):
        self._marker_function = None

    def _recache(self):
        if self._marker_function is not None:
            self._path = _empty_path
            self._transform = IdentityTransform()
            self._alt_path = None
            self._alt_transform = None
            self._snap_threshold = None
            self._joinstyle = 'round'
            self._capstyle = 'butt'
            self._filled = True
            self._marker_function()
```
