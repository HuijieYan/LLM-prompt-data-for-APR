## Analysis:
The buggy function `_recache` in the `MarkerStyle` class is attempting to call a `_marker_function` without checking if it exists or not. This can potentially lead to an error if `_marker_function` is not defined.

## Bug Cause:
The bug is caused by attempting to call `_marker_function` without checking its existence. If `_marker_function` is not defined, it will raise an error when called.

## Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
1. Check if `_marker_function` is not None before calling it.
2. Define a default behavior or provide a way to set `_marker_function` before calling `_recache`.

## The corrected version of the function:
```python
class MarkerStyle():
    def _recache(self):
        if self._marker_function is None:
            return

        self._path = _empty_path
        self._transform = IdentityTransform()
        self._alt_path = None
        self._alt_transform = None
        self._snap_threshold = None
        self._joinstyle = 'round'
        self._capstyle = 'butt'
        self._filled = True
        
        if self._marker_function:
            self._marker_function()
```

In the corrected version, we added a check to verify if `_marker_function` is not None before calling it to prevent potential errors. If `_marker_function` is not defined or set, the function will gracefully skip calling it.

Please replace the buggy function in your `markers.py` file with this corrected version.
