## Analysis:
The buggy function `_recache` of the `MarkerStyle` class is expected to recache attributes related to marker styles, but it has a critical issue in the `if` condition checking the existence of `_marker_function`. If `_marker_function` is `None`, the function should not proceed with the rest of the code and should exit early.

## Bug:
The bug is in the condition `if self._marker_function is None:`, which checks if `_marker_function` is `None`. If `_marker_function` is `None`, the function should not call `_marker_function()` as this will raise an error.

## Proposed Fix:
To fix the bug, we need to add a condition to check if `_marker_function` is not `None` before calling it. If `_marker_function` is `None`, the function should exit early without executing the remaining code.

## Corrected Version:
```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    self._filled = True
    self._marker_function()
```

In the corrected version, we added a condition to first check if `_marker_function` is not `None` before proceeding to execute it. If `_marker_function` is `None`, the function will exit early.
