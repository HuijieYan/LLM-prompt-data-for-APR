### Analysis:
The `_recache` function in the `MarkerStyle` class is intended to reset some attributes to their default values when called. However, there is a bug in the function where it tries to call a method stored in the `_marker_function` attribute without checking if it is `None` or not. This can lead to a `TypeError` if `_marker_function` is not a function.

### Error Locations:
The potential error in the code lies within the line `self._marker_function()` where it directly attempts to call `_marker_function` without verifying if it is `None` or if it is a callable function.

### Cause of the Bug:
The bug is caused by the assumption that `_marker_function` will always be a callable function. If `_marker_function` is `None` or not a function, calling it directly will result in a `TypeError`.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to add a check to ensure that `_marker_function` is not `None` and also that it is a callable function before calling it. This can be achieved by adding an `if` condition to check if `_marker_function` is not `None` and callable using `callable()` function.

### Corrected Version:
```python
# The declaration of the class containing the corrected function
class MarkerStyle():
    def _recache(self):
        if self._marker_function is not None and callable(self._marker_function):
            self._path = _empty_path
            self._transform = IdentityTransform()
            self._alt_path = None
            self._alt_transform = None
            self._snap_threshold = None
            self._joinstyle = 'round'
            self._capstyle = 'butt'
            self._filled = True
            self._marker_function()
```

In the corrected version, we added a condition `if self._marker_function is not None and callable(self._marker_function):` before calling `_marker_function()` to ensure that it will only be called if `_marker_function` is not `None` and is a callable function.
