## Analysis:
The buggy function `_recache` within the `MarkerStyle` class seems to have an issue with calling the `_marker_function` without checking its existence. This could lead to an AttributeError if `_marker_function` is not defined in the class.

## Potential Error Location:
The main issue seems to be on the line where `_marker_function()` is called without checking if `_marker_function` actually exists.

## Cause of the Bug:
The bug occurs due to the assumption that `_marker_function` will always be defined before calling it. If `_marker_function` is not defined, it would lead to an AttributeError.

## Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we should first check if `_marker_function` is not None before calling it. This will prevent the AttributeError and ensure that the function is only called if it exists.

## Corrected Version:

```python
# The declaration of the class containing the corrected function
class MarkerStyle():

    # The corrected version of the buggy function
    def _recache(self):
        if self._marker_function is None:
            return
        self._path = _empty_path
        self._transform = IdentityTransform()
        self._alt_path = None
        self._alt_transform = None
        self._snap_threshold = None
        self._joinstyle = 'round'
        self._capstyle = 'butt'
        self._filled = True
        self._marker_function()
```

In this corrected version, we first check if `_marker_function` is not None before calling it to avoid the AttributeError. This way, the function will only be executed if it exists, preventing any issues related to the function not being defined.
