The buggy function `_recache(self)` in the `MarkerStyle` class has a potential issue at the line `self._marker_function()`. The function tries to call `self._marker_function` without checking if it is a callable object. This can lead to a `TypeError` if `_marker_function` is not callable.

To fix this bug, we need to first check if `_marker_function` is a callable object before trying to execute it.

Here is the corrected version of the `_recache(self)` function:

```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: lib/matplotlib/markers.py

# The declaration of the class containing the corrected function
class MarkerStyle():
    def _recache(self):
        if self._marker_function is not None and callable(self._marker_function):
            self._path = _empty_path
            self._transform = IdentityTransform()
            self._alt_path = None
            self._alt_transform = None
            self._snap_threshold = None
            self._joinstyle = 'round'
            self._capstyle = 'butt'
            self._filled = True
            self._marker_function()
```

In the corrected version, we added a check to ensure that `_marker_function` is not `None` and also that it is callable before attempting to call it. This will prevent the `TypeError` that would occur if `_marker_function` is not callable.
