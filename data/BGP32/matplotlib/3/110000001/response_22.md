## Analysis:
- The `MarkerStyle` class contains the `_recache` method, which is responsible for recalculating properties of the marker style. 
- The bug lies in the line `self._marker_function()` where the function is called without being checked if it exists or not, which could raise an AttributeError.

## Potential Error Locations:
- Calling `_marker_function` without checking if it exists can cause an AttributeError if the function is not defined.

## Cause of the Bug:
- The bug occurs because the code attempts to call `_marker_function` even if it is None, which leads to an AttributeError.

## Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
- A strategy to fix the bug is to check if the `_marker_function` exists before calling it to avoid the AttributeError.

## Corrected Version:
```python
class MarkerStyle():
    def _recache(self):
        if self._marker_function is None:
            return
        self._path = _empty_path
        self._transform = IdentityTransform()
        self._alt_path = None
        self._alt_transform = None
        self._snap_threshold = None
        self._joinstyle = 'round'
        self._capstyle = 'butt'
        self._filled = True
        if callable(self._marker_function):
            self._marker_function()
```
