## Analysis:
- The `_recache` function in the `MarkerStyle` class initializes some attributes and calls the `_marker_function`.
- The `_recache` function relies on the presence of a `_marker_function` attribute, which must be a callable.

## Bug:
The bug in the `_recache` function is that it tries to call the `_marker_function` attribute without checking if it is callable, which may result in an error if `_marker_function` is not a function.

## Fix:
1. Check if `_marker_function` is callable before invoking it.
2. If `_marker_function` is callable, proceed with calling it; otherwise, skip calling it.

## Corrected version of the function:
```python
class MarkerStyle():

    def _recache(self):
        if self._marker_function is not None and callable(self._marker_function):
            self._path = _empty_path
            self._transform = IdentityTransform()
            self._alt_path = None
            self._alt_transform = None
            self._snap_threshold = None
            self._joinstyle = 'round'
            self._capstyle = 'butt'
            self._filled = True
            self._marker_function()
``` 

In the corrected version, we added a conditional check `if self._marker_function is not None and callable(self._marker_function):` before invoking `_marker_function`. This check ensures that we only call `_marker_function` if it is not `None` and is callable, thus preventing potential errors.
