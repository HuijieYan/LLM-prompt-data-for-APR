## Analysis:
- The buggy function `_recache` is part of the `MarkerStyle` class.
- The function seems to be initializing various attributes of the `MarkerStyle` class, but there is an issue with the invocation of `self._marker_function()`.
- The `_marker_function` attribute is assumed to be a function, but if it is not properly defined or set to `None`, it can cause an error.

## Potential Error Locations:
- The line `self._marker_function()` could potentially raise an error if `self._marker_function` is not properly defined or set to `None`.

## Cause of the Bug:
The cause of the bug is that the `_recache` function is assuming that `_marker_function` is a callable function, but it hasn't been properly defined or set to a function yet.

## Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
We need to ensure that `_marker_function` is properly defined before invoking it in the `_recache` function. This can be done by checking if `_marker_function` is callable before calling it.

## Corrected Version:
```python
class MarkerStyle():
    def __init__(self):
        self._marker_function = None

    def set_marker_function(self, marker_function):
        self._marker_function = marker_function

    def _recache(self):
        if self._marker_function is not None and callable(self._marker_function):
            self._path = _empty_path
            self._transform = IdentityTransform()
            self._alt_path = None
            self._alt_transform = None
            self._snap_threshold = None
            self._joinstyle = 'round'
            self._capstyle = 'butt'
            self._filled = True
            self._marker_function()
```

In this corrected version:
- I added an `__init__` method to initialize `_marker_function` as `None`.
- I added a `set_marker_function` method to set the `_marker_function` attribute.
- I modified the `_recache` function to check if `_marker_function` is not `None` and callable before invoking it. This ensures that the function is properly defined before execution.
