1. The buggy function `_recache` is located inside the `MarkerStyle` class in the `matplotlib.markers` module.

2. Within the `_recache` function, the potential error lies in the line where it calls `self._marker_function()` without checking if `_marker_function` is callable or not.

3. The cause of the bug is that the function blindly calls `_marker_function` without verifying if it exists or if it's callable. This can lead to a `TypeError` if `_marker_function` is not defined or not a function.

4. To fix the bug, we should add a check to ensure that `_marker_function` is callable before attempting to call it.

5. Here is the corrected version of the `_recache` function:

```python
# The declaration of the class containing the buggy function
class MarkerStyle():

    # Corrected _recache function
    def _recache(self):
        if self._marker_function is not None and callable(self._marker_function):
            self._path = _empty_path
            self._transform = IdentityTransform()
            self._alt_path = None
            self._alt_transform = None
            self._snap_threshold = None
            self._joinstyle = 'round'
            self._capstyle = 'butt'
            self._filled = True
            self._marker_function()
```

By adding the check `if self._marker_function is not None and callable(self._marker_function):`, we ensure that `_marker_function` is both defined and callable before executing it. This prevents any potential `TypeError` that may occur due to calling an undefined or non-function object.
