## Analysis:
1. The `MarkerStyle` class contains the `_recache` function, which is supposed to update certain attributes of the class instance.
2. The `_recache` function checks if the `_marker_function` attribute is `None` before proceeding with setting other attributes.
3. The bug seems to be related to the execution of `self._marker_function()` without validating its existence properly, which can result in a runtime error if `_marker_function` is not defined or callable.

## Potential Error Location:
The potential error lies in the statement `self._marker_function()` being called without confirming if `_marker_function` exists or is callable.

## Bug Cause:
The bug occurs because the code attempts to call `_marker_function` without verifying if it is defined and callable. This can lead to a runtime error if `_marker_function` is `None` or not a callable object.

## Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to check if `self._marker_function` is not `None` and is callable before invoking it. This will prevent potential runtime errors.

## Corrected Version:
```python
# The corrected version of the _recache function
class MarkerStyle():
    def _recache(self):
        if callable(self._marker_function):
            self._path = _empty_path
            self._transform = IdentityTransform()
            self._alt_path = None
            self._alt_transform = None
            self._snap_threshold = None
            self._joinstyle = 'round'
            self._capstyle = 'butt'
            self._filled = True
            self._marker_function()
```

In the corrected version, we use the `callable()` function to check if `_marker_function` is callable before invoking it. This ensures that the function is only called if it is defined and can be called, avoiding potential runtime errors.
