## Analysis:
The buggy function `_recache` within the `MarkerStyle` class is designed to recache the marker properties. The function attempts to call the `_marker_function`, assuming it is not `None`. However, the function lacks proper initialization of `_marker_function`, leading to potential errors.

### Error:
The main error lies in the condition checking for the existence of `_marker_function`. Since it is not properly initialized, the function will encounter an error when attempting to call it.

### Cause of the bug:
The bug occurs because `_marker_function` is not initialized within the `_recache` function or in the class constructor. This leads to the function attempting to call a `None` object, resulting in an error.

### Strategy for fixing the bug:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that `_marker_function` is properly initialized either within the class constructor or before calling `_recache`. By setting `_marker_function` to an appropriate function, we can avoid the error of calling a `None` object.

## Corrected Version:

```python
# The corrected version of the buggy function
class MarkerStyle:
    
    def __init__(self):
        self._marker_function = None
    
    def _recache(self):
        if self._marker_function is None:
            return
        self._path = _empty_path
        self._transform = IdentityTransform()
        self._alt_path = None
        self._alt_transform = None
        self._snap_threshold = None
        self._joinstyle = 'round'
        self._capstyle = 'butt'
        self._filled = True
        self._marker_function()
```

In the corrected version, a constructor `__init__` is added to initialize the `_marker_function` attribute to `None` by default. This ensures that `_marker_function` exists and can be properly used within the `_recache` function. By initializing `_marker_function` in the constructor, we prevent the function from encountering a `None` object when called.
