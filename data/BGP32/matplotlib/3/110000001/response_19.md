## Analysis:
The buggy function `_recache()` in the `MarkerStyle` class is attempting to call the `_marker_function` without checking if it is defined or not. This can lead to an error if `_marker_function` is not defined.

## Bug location:
The potential error locations in the buggy function are:
- Checking if `_marker_function` is `None` before calling it.
- Potential error in case `_marker_function` is not defined.

## Cause of the bug:
The bug is caused by calling `_marker_function` without checking if it is defined, which can lead to a `TypeError` if `_marker_function` is `None`.

## Fix strategy:
1. Check if `_marker_function` is `None` before calling it.
2. Handle the case when `_marker_function` is not defined to avoid errors.

## The corrected version of the function:

```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: lib/matplotlib/markers.py

# The corrected version of the class containing the fixed function
class MarkerStyle():

    def _recache(self):
        if self._marker_function is None:
            return
        
        self._path = _empty_path
        self._transform = IdentityTransform()
        self._alt_path = None
        self._alt_transform = None
        self._snap_threshold = None
        self._joinstyle = 'round'
        self._capstyle = 'butt'
        self._filled = True
        self._marker_function()
    
``` 

This corrected version of the `_recache()` function includes a check to ensure that `_marker_function` is not `None` before calling it, thus preventing any potential `TypeError` that might occur.
