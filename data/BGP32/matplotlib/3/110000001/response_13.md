The buggy function `_recache` in the `MarkerStyle` class is trying to call a `_marker_function` without checking if it is defined. This can cause an error if `_marker_function` is not defined before calling.

Here is the corrected version of the `_recache` function with additional validation added:

```python
# The declaration of the class containing the corrected function
class MarkerStyle:

    def _recache(self):
        if self._marker_function is None or not callable(self._marker_function):
            return
        self._path = _empty_path
        self._transform = IdentityTransform()
        self._alt_path = None
        self._alt_transform = None
        self._snap_threshold = None
        self._joinstyle = 'round'
        self._capstyle = 'butt'
        self._filled = True
        self._marker_function()
```

In this corrected version, we added an additional check to ensure that `_marker_function` is both not `None` and callable before attempting to call it. This prevents potential errors that may occur if `_marker_function` is undefined or not a callable object.
