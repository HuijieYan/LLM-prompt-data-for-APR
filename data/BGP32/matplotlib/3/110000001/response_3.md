The buggy function `_recache()` in the `MarkerStyle` class seems to have an issue where it is trying to call `self._marker_function()` without initializing it first, which can lead to a potential `AttributeError`. The condition `if self._marker_function is None` might not be sufficient to handle all cases where `_marker_function` might be `None`.

To fix this bug, we can add a check to ensure that `_marker_function` is callable before trying to execute it.

Here is the corrected version of the `_recache()` function:

```python
class MarkerStyle:
    def _recache(self):
        if callable(self._marker_function):
            self._path = _empty_path
            self._transform = IdentityTransform()
            self._alt_path = None
            self._alt_transform = None
            self._snap_threshold = None
            self._joinstyle = 'round'
            self._capstyle = 'butt'
            self._filled = True
            self._marker_function()
```

In this corrected version, we first check if `self._marker_function` is callable using the `callable()` function. If it is callable, then we proceed to execute `_marker_function()`; otherwise, we skip that step. This fix ensures that the function is only called when it is defined and callable, preventing any potential errors.
