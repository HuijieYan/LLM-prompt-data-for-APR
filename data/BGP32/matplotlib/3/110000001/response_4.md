The potential error location in the buggy function is the line where the `_marker_function()` is being called without being properly initialized or defined.

The cause of the bug is that the `_marker_function` attribute is being checked for `None`, but even if it is not `None`, the function is being called without any proper implementation. This can lead to unexpected behavior or errors.

To fix this bug, we need to ensure that `_marker_function` is properly initialized and defined before calling it. We can add a condition to check if `_marker_function` is callable and then call it.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
class MarkerStyle():

    def _recache(self):
        if self._marker_function is None or not callable(self._marker_function):
            return
        self._path = _empty_path
        self._transform = IdentityTransform()
        self._alt_path = None
        self._alt_transform = None
        self._snap_threshold = None
        self._joinstyle = 'round'
        self._capstyle = 'butt'
        self._filled = True
        self._marker_function()
```

In this corrected version, before calling `_marker_function`, we first check if it is not `None` and if it is callable using the `callable()` function. If it is `None` or not callable, we return from the function without executing the potentially buggy function call.
