## Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_recache` is a method of the `MarkerStyle` class.
2. It tries to recache the attributes of the `MarkerStyle` instance.
3. The issue lies in the line where `_marker_function()` is called without checking if it exists.

## Identifying the Bug:
The bug in the `_recache` function is that it directly calls `self._marker_function()` without checking if `_marker_function` is defined, which can lead to a `NoneType` object has no attribute error.

## Bug Cause:
The bug is caused by directly calling `_marker_function` without verifying if it exists. If `_marker_function` is `None`, calling it will result in an AttributeError.

## Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to include a condition to check if `_marker_function` is not `None` before calling it.

## Corrected Version:
```python
# The corrected version of the buggy function
class MarkerStyle():
    def _recache(self):
        if self._marker_function is None:
            return
        self._path = _empty_path
        self._transform = IdentityTransform()
        self._alt_path = None
        self._alt_transform = None
        self._snap_threshold = None
        self._joinstyle = 'round'
        self._capstyle = 'butt'
        self._filled = True
        self._marker_function()
```
