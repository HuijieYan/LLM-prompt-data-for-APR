The buggy function `_recache` in the `MarkerStyle` class has an issue where it tries to call `self._marker_function()` without defining it or checking if it exists. This can lead to an error if `_marker_function` does not exist or is not initialized.

To fix this bug, we can check if `_marker_function` is not `None` before attempting to call it. If it is `None`, then we should skip the call to avoid any errors.

Here is the corrected version of the `_recache` function:

```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: lib/matplotlib/markers.py

# The corrected version of the class containing the fixed function
class MarkerStyle():
    
    def _recache(self):
        if self._marker_function is None:
            return
        self._path = _empty_path
        self._transform = IdentityTransform()
        self._alt_path = None
        self._alt_transform = None
        self._snap_threshold = None
        self._joinstyle = 'round'
        self._capstyle = 'butt'
        self._filled = True
        self._marker_function()
```

In the corrected version, we added a check to ensure that `_marker_function` is not `None` before attempting to call it. This prevents any potential errors that may arise from calling a non-existent function.
