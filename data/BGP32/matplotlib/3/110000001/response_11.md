The issue in the buggy function `_recache` is that it is trying to call a function `self._marker_function()` without checking if it is callable. This can lead to errors if `self._marker_function` is not defined or not a callable object.

To fix this bug, we can check if `self._marker_function` is callable before invoking it. Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
# The declaration of the class containing the corrected function
class MarkerStyle():

    def _recache(self):
        if self._marker_function is None:
            return
        
        if callable(self._marker_function):
            self._path = _empty_path
            self._transform = IdentityTransform()
            self._alt_path = None
            self._alt_transform = None
            self._snap_threshold = None
            self._joinstyle = 'round'
            self._capstyle = 'butt'
            self._filled = True
            self._marker_function()
        else:
            raise AttributeError("Marker function is not callable")
```

In the corrected version, we added a check using `callable(self._marker_function)` to ensure that `self._marker_function` is callable before attempting to call it. If `self._marker_function` is not callable, it will raise an `AttributeError`.

This fix ensures that the `_recache` function will only invoke `self._marker_function` if it is defined and callable, preventing potential errors.
