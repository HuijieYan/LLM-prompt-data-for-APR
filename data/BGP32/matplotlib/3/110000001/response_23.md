The buggy function `_recache` in the `MarkerStyle` class is missing the assignment of the `_marker_function` attribute. 

Here's an explanation of the bug:
1. The function `_recache` checks if the `_marker_function` is `None` and returns if it is.
2. The function then initializes some attributes, but it attempts to call `_marker_function()` without ensuring `_marker_function` is actually set to a function.

To fix this bug, you should add an assignment for the `_marker_function` attribute before calling it in the `_recache` function.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: lib/matplotlib/markers.py

# The declaration of the class with the corrected function
class MarkerStyle():
    def __init__(self):
        self._marker_function = None

    def _recache(self):
        if self._marker_function is None:
            return
        self._path = _empty_path
        self._transform = IdentityTransform()
        self._alt_path = None
        self._alt_transform = None
        self._snap_threshold = None
        self._joinstyle = 'round'
        self._capstyle = 'butt'
        self._filled = True
        self._marker_function()  # Call the marker function only if it is set
```

In the corrected version, I added an initialization of the `_marker_function` attribute in the class's constructor (`__init__()` method) and then check if it's `None` before calling it in the `_recache()` function.
