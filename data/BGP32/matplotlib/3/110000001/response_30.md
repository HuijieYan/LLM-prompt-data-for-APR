## Analysis:
The buggy function `_recache` within the `MarkerStyle` class initializes various attributes with default values if `_marker_function` is not `None`. However, there is a call to `_marker_function` at the end, which may cause an issue if `_marker_function` is not properly defined in the context of the class.

## Identified Issue:
The main issue in the `_recache` function is the unconditional call to `_marker_function` without checking if it is defined, which may lead to a `TypeError` if `_marker_function` is not a callable object.

## Cause of the Bug:
The bug occurs because the code tries to call `_marker_function` without verifying its existence, resulting in a potential `TypeError` which halts the program's execution.

## Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to add a check to ensure `_marker_function` is defined and callable before trying to invoke it. This will prevent any potential `TypeError` and ensure that only valid functions are executed.

## Corrected Version:
```python
class MarkerStyle():
    def _recache(self):
        if self._marker_function is not None and callable(self._marker_function):
            self._path = _empty_path
            self._transform = IdentityTransform()
            self._alt_path = None
            self._alt_transform = None
            self._snap_threshold = None
            self._joinstyle = 'round'
            self._capstyle = 'butt'
            self._filled = True
            self._marker_function()
```

In the corrected version, we added a check to ensure that `_marker_function` is not `None` and is callable using the `callable` function. This prevents any potential `TypeError` and ensures safe execution of `_marker_function` only when it is valid.
