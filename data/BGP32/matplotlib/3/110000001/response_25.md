The buggy function `_recache` in the `MarkerStyle` class is attempting to execute the `_marker_function` without checking if it exists. This can result in a `TypeError` if `_marker_function` is `None`.

To fix this bug, we need to ensure that `_marker_function` is checked for existence before attempting to execute it. We can modify the function to check if `_marker_function` is not `None` before calling it.

Here is the corrected version of the `_recache` function:

```python
# The declaration of the class containing the buggy function
class MarkerStyle():

    def _recache(self):
        if self._marker_function is not None:  # Check if _marker_function exists
            self._path = _empty_path
            self._transform = IdentityTransform()
            self._alt_path = None
            self._alt_transform = None
            self._snap_threshold = None
            self._joinstyle = 'round'
            self._capstyle = 'butt'
            self._filled = True
            self._marker_function()
```

By adding the check `if self._marker_function is not None`, we ensure that the `_marker_function` is only called if it is not `None`, preventing a potential `TypeError` from occurring.
