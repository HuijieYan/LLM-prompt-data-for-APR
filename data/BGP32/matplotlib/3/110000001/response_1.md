The buggy function `_recache` in the `MarkerStyle` class has a potential error related to the `_marker_function()` call. The function does not assign any value to the `_marker_function` attribute, and if it is not set to `None` initially, the function call could result in an error.

To fix this bug, we need to ensure that `_marker_function` is properly initialized before calling it. We can check if `_marker_function` exists as an attribute of the class before calling it.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
class MarkerStyle():

    def __init__(self):
        self._marker_function = None

    def _recache(self):
        if self._marker_function is None:
            return

        self._path = _empty_path
        self._transform = IdentityTransform()
        self._alt_path = None
        self._alt_transform = None
        self._snap_threshold = None
        self._joinstyle = 'round'
        self._capstyle = 'butt'
        self._filled = True

        if callable(self._marker_function):
            self._marker_function()
```

In this corrected version, we added an initialization of `_marker_function` in the class `__init__` method and changed the conditional check before calling `_marker_function` to ensure it is callable. This fix should prevent any errors related to calling an undefined function.
