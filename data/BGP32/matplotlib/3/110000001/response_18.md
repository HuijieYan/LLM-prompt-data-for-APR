## Analysis:
1. The `MarkerStyle` class contains the `_recache` method, which is responsible for recalculating marker properties.
2. The bug lies in the line `self._marker_function()`, where it tries to call the `_marker_function` attribute without checking if it is actually a function.

## Error location:
The error is in the line `self._marker_function()` where it is called without validation.

## Cause of the bug:
The bug occurs because the `_marker_function` attribute is checked for `None`, but not for whether it is a function or not. If `_marker_function` is set to anything other than a function, calling it will result in an error.

## Fix strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to handle the case where `_marker_function` is not a function before attempting to call it.

## Corrected version:
```python
class MarkerStyle():
    def _recache(self):
        if self._marker_function is None or not callable(self._marker_function):
            return
        self._path = _empty_path
        self._transform = IdentityTransform()
        self._alt_path = None
        self._alt_transform = None
        self._snap_threshold = None
        self._joinstyle = 'round'
        self._capstyle = 'butt'
        self._filled = True
        self._marker_function()
``` 

In the corrected version, before calling `self._marker_function()`, we first check if it is `None` or not callable using `callable(self._marker_function)`. This ensures that the function is only called if it is a valid callable object.
