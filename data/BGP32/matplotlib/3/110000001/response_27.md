## Analysis:
The `_recache` function in the `MarkerStyle` class is encountering a bug due to the call to `_marker_function` without checking if it exists or is callable. If `_marker_function` is None or not callable, it will raise an error.

## Bug Location:
The bug is located in the line:
```python
self._marker_function()
```

## Cause of the Bug:
The bug is caused by calling `_marker_function` unconditionally without checking if it exists or is callable. If `_marker_function` is not defined or callable, it will lead to an error.

## Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to check if `_marker_function` is not None and callable before invoking it. This will prevent any potential errors during the execution of the function.

## Corrected Version:
```python
# The declaration of the class containing the corrected function
class MarkerStyle():
    def _recache(self):
        if self._marker_function is not None and callable(self._marker_function):
            self._path = _empty_path
            self._transform = IdentityTransform()
            self._alt_path = None
            self._alt_transform = None
            self._snap_threshold = None
            self._joinstyle = 'round'
            self._capstyle = 'butt'
            self._filled = True
            self._marker_function()
``` 

In the corrected version, we first check if `_marker_function` is not None and whether it is callable using the `callable()` function before invoking it. This will ensure that the function is only called if it exists and is callable, preventing any potential errors.
