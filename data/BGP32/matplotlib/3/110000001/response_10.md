## Correction:

The buggy function `_recache` is missing the definition of `_marker_function`, which is called without being defined within the class. This results in a `NoneType` object error.

### Corrected Version:

To fix the bug, we need to define the `_marker_function` within the class `MarkerStyle` before calling it in the `_recache` function.

```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: lib/matplotlib/markers.py

# The declaration of the class containing the buggy function
class MarkerStyle():

    # Define _marker_function
    def _marker_function(self):
        pass

    # Corrected _recache function
    def _recache(self):
        if self._marker_function is None:  # Fixed the condition, check for the method itself
            return
        self._path = _empty_path
        self._transform = IdentityTransform()
        self._alt_path = None
        self._alt_transform = None
        self._snap_threshold = None
        self._joinstyle = 'round'
        self._capstyle = 'butt'
        self._filled = True
        self._marker_function()
```

By defining the `_marker_function` within the class before calling it in the `_recache` function, we have resolved the bug that was causing a `NoneType` error.
