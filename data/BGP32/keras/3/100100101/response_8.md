The bug in the `_clone_functional_model` function is in the creation of input layers and missing assignment to the `input_layers` variable, causing an issue with the subsequent node processing loop. Here's a breakdown of the issue step by step:

1. The function fails to create `input_layers` when `input_tensors` are provided, leading to an empty list.
2. The `input_layers` list remains empty, causing a problem in the processing of nodes later on.
3. As a result, the function cannot correctly map the input tensors and output tensors in the subsequent steps.

To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the `input_layers` are correctly created and assigned to the `layer_map` for further processing of nodes.

Here is the corrected version of the `_clone_functional_model` function:

```python
def _clone_functional_model(model, input_tensors=None):
    if not isinstance(model, Model):
        raise ValueError('Expected `model` argument to be a `Model` instance, got ', model)
    if isinstance(model, Sequential):
        raise ValueError('Expected `model` argument to be a functional `Model` instance, got a `Sequential` instance instead:', model)

    layer_map = {}  # Cache for created layers.
    tensor_map = {}  # Map {reference_tensor: (corresponding_tensor, mask)}
    
    # Create placeholders or take provided input tensors
    input_layers = [layer for layer in model._input_layers]
    if input_tensors is None:
        input_tensors = [Input(batch_shape=layer.batch_input_shape,
                                dtype=layer.dtype,
                                sparse=layer.sparse,
                                name=layer.name) for layer in input_layers]
    else:
        input_tensors = to_list(input_tensors)
        for i, x in enumerate(input_tensors):
            if not K.is_keras_tensor(x):
                name = input_layers[i].name
                input_tensor = Input(tensor=x, name='input_wrapper_for_' + name)
                input_tensors[i] = input_tensor
    
    for original, cloned in zip(model._input_layers, input_tensors):
        layer_map[original] = cloned

    for x, y in zip(model.inputs, input_tensors):
        tensor_map[x] = (y, None)  # tensor, mask

    # Iterate over every node in the reference model, in depth order
    depth_keys = sorted(model._nodes_by_depth.keys(), reverse=True)
    for depth in depth_keys:
        nodes = model._nodes_by_depth[depth]
        for node in nodes:
            # Remaining code remains the same

    # Check for model outputs, instantiate a new model
    output_tensors = []
    for x in model.outputs:
        assert x in tensor_map, 'Could not compute output ' + str(x)
        tensor, _ = tensor_map[x]
        output_tensors.append(tensor)
    
    return Model(input_tensors, output_tensors, name=model.name)
```

This corrected version ensures that the `input_layers` list is properly managed and mapped to the input tensors. Consequently, the function should now correctly clone the functional model as expected.
