### Bug Explanation:
The bug in the `_clone_functional_model` function arises from the incorrect handling of input layers and tensors when creating a clone model. The function fails to properly create and maintain the mapping between original and cloned layers, leading to inconsistencies in the cloned model's input structure.

### Bug Location:
One of the key issues is in the creation and handling of input layers and tensors within the function. The function fails to properly cache input layers and manage the associated tensors when constructing the cloned model.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To address the bug, it is essential to ensure that the input layers and tensors are correctly processed and mapped between the original model and the cloned model. Proper handling of input tensors, layer cloning, and tensor mapping will be crucial for fixing the bug.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
Here is the corrected version of the `_clone_functional_model` function:

```python
def _clone_functional_model(model, input_tensors=None):
    if not isinstance(model, Model):
        raise ValueError('Expected `model` argument to be a `Model` instance, got ', model)
    if isinstance(model, Sequential):
        raise ValueError('Expected `model` argument to be a functional `Model` instance, got a `Sequential` instance instead:', model)

    layer_map = {}  
    tensor_map = {}
    new_input_layers = []
    input_tensors = input_tensors if input_tensors is not None else []
    for layer in model.layers:
        new_layer = layer.__class__.from_config(layer.get_config())
        layer_map[layer] = new_layer
        if isinstance(layer, InputLayer):
            new_input_layers.append(new_layer)
        tensor_map[layer.output] = new_layer.output

    for layer in model.layers:
        if not isinstance(layer, InputLayer):
            new_layer = layer_map[layer]
            for node in layer._inbound_nodes:
                input_tensors = [tensor_map[x] for x in node.input_tensors]
                output_tensors = new_layer(input_tensors)
                if not isinstance(output_tensors, list):
                    output_tensors = [output_tensors]
                for i, input_tensor in enumerate(node.input_tensors):
                    tensor_map[input_tensor] = output_tensors[i]
    
    inputs = [tensor_map[x] for x in model.inputs]
    outputs = [tensor_map[x] for x in model.outputs]
    return Model(inputs=inputs, outputs=outputs, name=model.name)
```

With this corrected version, the function should now properly handle the cloning of a functional model, including input layers and tensors, and ensure the mapping between original and cloned layers is correctly maintained.
