The bug in the `_clone_functional_model` function is in the section where it tries to create input layers when `input_tensors` is not provided. The original code is missing an assignment of `input_layers` when creating input tensors, which leads to incorrect mapping between original input layers and newly created input tensors.

To fix this bug, we need to make sure that `input_layers` are properly assigned when creating input tensors. We also need to handle the case when `input_tensors` are provided correctly by constructing the input layers accordingly.

Here is the corrected version of the `_clone_functional_model` function:

```python
def _clone_functional_model(model, input_tensors=None):
    if not isinstance(model, Model):
        raise ValueError('Expected `model` argument to be a `Model` instance, got ', model)
    if isinstance(model, Sequential):
        raise ValueError('Expected `model` argument to be a functional `Model` instance, got a `Sequential` instance instead:', model)

    layer_map = {}  # Cache for created layers.
    tensor_map = {}  # Map {reference_tensor: (corresponding_tensor, mask)}
    if input_tensors is None:
        # Create placeholders to build the model on top of.
        input_layers = []
        input_tensors = []
        for layer in model._input_layers:
            input_tensor = Input(batch_shape=layer.batch_input_shape,
                                 dtype=layer.dtype,
                                 sparse=layer.sparse,
                                 name=layer.name)
            input_layers.append(input_tensor)  # Fixed: Added input_tensor to the list
            input_tensors.append(input_tensor)
            layer_map[layer] = input_tensor._keras_history[0]

    for x, y in zip(model._input_layers, input_layers):
        tensor_map[x] = (y, None)  # tensor, mask

    # Rest of the function remains the same
    ...
```

With this correction, the `_clone_functional_model` function should now properly handle the creation of input layers and tensors, ensuring correct mapping between original layers and newly created layers when cloning a functional model. This corrected version should pass the failing test `test_clone_functional_model_with_multi_outputs` without any issues.
