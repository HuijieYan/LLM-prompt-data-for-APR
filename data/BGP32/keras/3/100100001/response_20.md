The bug in the `_clone_functional_model` function lies in how it handles input tensors when creating a new model. The function fails to properly map the input tensors to the corresponding layers, resulting in incorrect behavior when trying to clone a model with multiple inputs and outputs.

To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the mapping between original input tensors and newly created input layers is correctly maintained throughout the cloning process. Additionally, we need to handle cases where multiple input tensors are involved, as in the failing test case provided.

Here is the corrected version of the `_clone_functional_model` function:

```python
def _clone_functional_model(model, input_tensors=None):
    if not isinstance(model, Model):
        raise ValueError('Expected `model` argument to be a `Model` instance, got ', model)
    
    if isinstance(model, Sequential):
        raise ValueError('Expected `model` argument to be a functional `Model` instance, got a `Sequential` instance instead:', model)
    
    layer_map = {}  # Cache for created layers
    tensor_map = {}  # Map {reference_tensor: (corresponding_tensor, mask)}
    
    # Handle input tensors
    if input_tensors is None:
        input_tensors = [Input(batch_shape=input_layer.input_shape[1:]) for input_layer in model.input_layers]

    for input_layer, input_tensor in zip(model._input_layers, input_tensors):
        layer_map[input_layer] = input_tensor
    
    for layer in model.layers:
        new_layer = layer.__class__.from_config(layer.get_config())
        layer_map[layer] = new_layer
    
    # Iterate through the model to set up connections
    for layer in model.layers:
        input_tensors = [tensor_map[i] for i in layer.input_tensors]
        kwargs = getattr(layer, 'arguments', {})
        output_tensors = layer(input_tensors, **kwargs)
        tensor_map.update(zip(layer.output_tensors, output_tensors))
    
    inputs = [layer_map[input_layer] for input_layer in model._input_layers]
    outputs = [tensor_map[output] for output in model.outputs]
    
    return Model(inputs=inputs, outputs=outputs, name=model.name)
```

By appropriately handling input tensors and maintaining the mapping between layers and tensors throughout the cloning process, the corrected version of `_clone_functional_model` function should pass the failing test case provided.
