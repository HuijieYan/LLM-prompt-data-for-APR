### Analysis:
The buggy function `_clone_functional_model` is designed to clone a functional `Model` instance by creating new layers and weights instead of sharing the existing ones. The function goes through the layers of the provided model and clones them while updating the input and output tensors. 

### Bug Location:
There are a few potential error locations within the buggy function:
1. The initial creation of `input_layers` and the settings of input placeholders.
2. The handling of input tensors when provided by the user.
3. The loop over nodes and the construction of the cloned layers.

### Cause of the bug:
One of the main causes of the bug is related to the incorrect assignment and handling of input tensors in the function, leading to inconsistencies when building the new model. Additionally, the loop over nodes might introduce errors due to improper handling of layer instances.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug in the function, we need to ensure proper handling of input tensors whether they are provided by the user or created within the function. Additionally, we should review the loop over nodes to guarantee the correct cloning of layers and updating of the tensor mappings.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def _clone_functional_model(model, input_tensors=None):
    if not isinstance(model, Model):
        raise ValueError('Expected `model` argument to be a `Model` instance, got ', model)
    if isinstance(model, Sequential):
        raise ValueError('Expected `model` argument to be a functional `Model` instance, got a `Sequential` instance instead:', model)

    layer_map = {}  
    tensor_map = {}

    if input_tensors is None:
        input_layers = []
        input_tensors = []
        for layer in model._input_layers:
            input_tensor = Input(batch_shape=layer.input_shape[1:],
                                 dtype=layer.input_spec.dtype)
            input_tensors.append(input_tensor)
            layer_map[layer] = input_tensor
        for i, layer in enumerate(model._input_layers):
            layer_map[layer] = input_tensors[i]
    else:
        input_tensors = to_list(input_tensors)
        for i, x in enumerate(input_tensors):
            if not K.is_keras_tensor(x):
                input_tensor = Input(tensor=x)
                layer_map[model._input_layers[i]] = input_tensor
            else:
                layer_map[model._input_layers[i]] = x

    for x, y in zip(model.inputs, input_tensors):
        tensor_map[x] = y

    for layer in model.layers:
        if layer not in layer_map:
            new_layer = layer.__class__.from_config(layer.get_config())
            layer_map[layer] = new_layer

    output_tensors = []
    for x in model.outputs:
        assert x in tensor_map, 'Could not compute output ' + str(x)
        output_tensors.append(tensor_map[x])

    return Model(input_tensors, output_tensors, name=model.name)
```

In the corrected version, the handling of input tensors and the creation of placeholders have been updated. The loop over layers has been simplified to ensure proper cloning, and the output tensors are retrieved correctly. This should address the issues in the original buggy function.
