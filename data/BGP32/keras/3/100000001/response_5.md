### Analysis:
The buggy function `_clone_functional_model` is intended to clone a functional Keras model with newly instantiated weights. However, there are several potential error locations within the code where bugs might occur:
1. The function checks if the input `model` is of type `Model` but then also checks if it is an instance of `Sequential` which is unnecessary.
2. `input_layers` list is created but not used properly within the code.
3. The mapping of input tensors to newly created tensors is incorrect in some places.
4. There might be issues with creating and caching new layers correctly.
5. There could be problems with the logic of updating `tensor_map`.

### Bug Cause:
The bug in the provided function might be due to the incorrect mapping of input tensors, improper handling of newly created layers, and incorrect usage of the `input_layers` list.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug in the function, we need to ensure that:
1. The mapping of input tensors is done correctly.
2. Newly created layers are cached properly.
3. The input_layers list is used appropriately.
4. The tensor_map is updated accurately.
5. The logic for cloning the layers is functioning correctly.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def _clone_functional_model(model, input_tensors=None):
    if not isinstance(model, Model):
        raise ValueError('Expected `model` argument to be a `Model` instance, got ', model)

    layer_map = {}  # Cache for created layers
    tensor_map = {}  # Map {reference_tensor: (corresponding_tensor, mask)}

    if input_tensors is None:
        # Create placeholders to build the model on top of
        input_layers = []

        for layer in model._input_layers:
            input_tensor = Input(batch_shape=layer.batch_input_shape,
                                 dtype=layer.dtype,
                                 sparse=layer.sparse,
                                 name=layer.name)
            input_layers.append(input_tensor)
            layer_map[layer] = input_tensor

        input_tensors = input_layers
    else:
        input_tensors = to_list(input_tensors)

    for x, y in zip(model.inputs, input_tensors):
        tensor_map[x] = (y, None)  # tensor, mask

    for depth in range(len(model._nodes_by_depth)):
        nodes = model._nodes_by_depth.get(depth, [])
        
        for node in nodes:
            layer = node.outbound_layer

            if layer not in layer_map:
                new_layer = layer.__class__.from_config(layer.get_config())
                layer_map[layer] = new_layer
                layer = new_layer
            else:
                layer = layer_map[layer]

                if isinstance(layer, InputLayer):
                    continue

            reference_input_tensors = node.input_tensors

            computed_data = []
            for x in reference_input_tensors:
                if x in tensor_map:
                    computed_data.append(tensor_map[x])

            if len(computed_data) == len(reference_input_tensors):
                kwargs = node.arguments if node.arguments else {}
                
                computed_tensors = [x[0] for x in computed_data]
                computed_masks = [x[1] for x in computed_data]

                if has_arg(layer.call, 'mask') and 'mask' not in kwargs:
                    kwargs['mask'] = computed_masks

                output_tensors = to_list(layer(computed_tensors, **kwargs))
                output_masks = to_list(layer.compute_mask(computed_tensors, computed_masks))

                for x, y, mask in zip(node.output_tensors, output_tensors, output_masks):
                    tensor_map[x] = (y, mask)

    output_tensors = [tensor_map[x][0] for x in model.outputs]
    return Model(input_tensors, output_tensors, name=model.name)
```

In the corrected version, I have fixed the input tensor creation, usage of created layers, updating tensor_map, and the logic for cloning layers. This corrected version should address the bugs present in the original function.
