### Analysis:
The `_clone_functional_model` function is intended to create a clone of a functional `Model` instance, replicating the behavior of the original model with new layers and newly instantiated weights. The function iterates through the layers of the model, cloning each layer and creating a mapping between the original tensors in the model and the new tensors in the clone.

### Potential Error Locations:
1. The way input tensors are handled within the function, especially when input_tensors are provided as an argument.
2. Handling of the mapping between old and new layers and tensors.
3. Correctly handling the layer creation for different types of layers.

### Bug Cause:
The bug might be caused by incorrect handling of input tensors when they are provided as an argument to the function. The logic for creating new input layers might be flawed, leading to incorrect mapping between original input layers and the newly created input layers.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Ensure that the creation of input layers is correct and that the mapping between original and new layers is accurate.
2. Check the logic of cloning layers, making sure that each layer is cloned appropriately while maintaining the correct relationships between layers.
3. Verify that the tensor mapping is updated correctly throughout the function.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def _clone_functional_model(model, input_tensors=None):
    if not isinstance(model, Model):
        raise ValueError('Expected `model` argument to be a `Model` instance, got ', model)
    if isinstance(model, Sequential):
        raise ValueError('Expected `model` argument to be a functional `Model` instance, got a `Sequential` instance instead:', model)

    layer_map = {}  # Cache for created layers.
    tensor_map = {}  # Map {reference_tensor: (corresponding_tensor, mask)}
    
    if input_tensors is None:
        # Create placeholders to build the model on top of.
        input_tensors = [Input(batch_shape=layer.batch_input_shape, dtype=layer.dtype, sparse=layer.sparse, name=layer.name)
                         for layer in model._input_layers]
    else:
        # Make sure that all input tensors come from a Keras layer.
        input_tensors = [Input(tensor=x, name=f'input_wrapper_for_{model._input_layers[i].name}')
                         if not K.is_keras_tensor(x) else x
                         for i, x in enumerate(to_list(input_tensors))]

    for original_layer, cloned_layer in zip(model._input_layers, input_tensors):
        layer_map[original_layer] = cloned_layer

    for x, y in zip(model.inputs, input_tensors):
        tensor_map[x] = (y, None)  # tensor, mask

    for depth in sorted(model._nodes_by_depth.keys(), reverse=True):
        for node in model._nodes_by_depth[depth]:
            layer = node.outbound_layer
            if layer not in layer_map:
                new_layer = layer.__class__.from_config(layer.get_config())
                layer_map[layer] = new_layer
            else:
                new_layer = layer_map[layer]
                if isinstance(new_layer, InputLayer):
                    continue
            
            computed_data = [(tensor_map[x] if x in tensor_map else None) for x in node.input_tensors]
            if all(computed_data):
                kwargs = node.arguments if node.arguments else {}
                computed_tensors, computed_masks = zip(*computed_data)
                kwargs['mask'] = computed_masks if has_arg(new_layer.call, 'mask') and 'mask' not in kwargs else None
                output_tensors = to_list(new_layer(computed_tensors, **kwargs))
                output_masks = to_list(new_layer.compute_mask(computed_tensors, computed_masks))
                for output_tensor, reference_output_tensor, output_mask in zip(output_tensors, node.output_tensors, output_masks):
                    tensor_map[reference_output_tensor] = (output_tensor, output_mask)

    output_tensors = [tensor_map[x][0] for x in model.outputs]
    
    return Model(input_tensors, output_tensors, name=model.name)
```

In the corrected version, the handling of input tensors is revised, ensuring that the creation of input layers, layer cloning, and tensor mapping are all handled correctly. The bug in the original implementation related to input tensor processing should be fixed with this update.
