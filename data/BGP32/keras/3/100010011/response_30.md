### Bug Analysis:
- The error message indicates that the assertion at line 166 is failing, specifically the check for `assert x in tensor_map`.
- The GitHub issue points out a similar issue related to `clone_model` when using a model with multiple outputs without mask support.
- The code does not handle the scenario where the `Lambda` layer does not support masks and only returns one output instead of multiple outputs.

### Bug Cause:
- The Lambda layer in the model is providing a single output while the code is expecting multiple outputs.
- The code does not handle the case where the `output_masks` are not available due to lack of mask support in the layers.

### Bug Fix:
- Modify the code to handle the scenario where the Lambda layer provides a single output without masks.
- Update the code to check the length of `reference_output_tensors` and handle the single output case accordingly.

### Updated Function:
```python
def _clone_functional_model(model, input_tensors=None):
    # Existing code

    for x, y in zip(model.inputs, input_tensors):
        tensor_map[x] = (y, None)  # tensor, mask

    # Existing code

    # Check that we did compute the model outputs,
    # then instantiate a new model from inputs and outputs.
    output_tensors = []
    for x in model.outputs:
        if x in tensor_map:
            tensor, _ = tensor_map[x]
            output_tensors.append(tensor)
        else:
            raise ValueError('Could not compute output ' + str(x))
    
    return Model(input_tensors, output_tensors, name=model.name)
```

### After Fix:
The above updated function should resolve the issue related to handling the Lambda layer with multiple outputs without mask support when cloning the model.
