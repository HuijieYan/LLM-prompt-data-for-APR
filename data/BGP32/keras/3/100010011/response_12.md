### Analysis:
The buggy function `_clone_functional_model` is responsible for creating a clone of a functional model instance in Keras. The error message indicates that an assertion fails when trying to compute the output tensors in the cloned model instance. This issue was also highlighted in the GitHub bug report where the user encountered the error while using `clone_model` in a specific scenario involving multi outputs, Lambda layers, and possible multi-GPU settings.

### Identified Issues:
1. The bug arises when the function tries to compute the output tensors for the cloned model.
2. The issue seems to be related to Lambda layers not supporting masks, leading to incorrect output masks and assertion failure.

### Bug Cause:
The bug occurs due to the Lambda layer not supporting masks. When the `_clone_functional_model` function tries to compute the output tensors for a model with a Lambda layer producing multiple outputs, it fails to handle the lack of masks correctly, leading to unsuccessful computation of the output tensors.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To address the bug, we need to modify the implementation of `_clone_functional_model` to handle the scenario where the model contains layers like Lambda that do not support masks. By adjusting the logic to correctly compute the output tensors without relying on masks from unsupported layers, we can ensure the cloned model creation process is successful.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def _clone_functional_model(model, input_tensors=None):
    # Existing code goes here...

    # Update tensor_map.
    for x, y, mask in zip(reference_output_tensors, output_tensors, [None] * len(output_tensors)):
        tensor_map[x] = (y, mask)

    # Check that we did compute the model outputs,
    # then instantiate a new model from inputs and outputs.
    output_tensors = []
    for x in model.outputs:
        assert x in tensor_map, 'Could not compute output ' + str(x)
        tensor, _ = tensor_map[x]
        output_tensors.append(tensor)

    return Model(input_tensors, output_tensors, name=model.name)
```

In the corrected version, the problematic behavior related to masks from Lambda layers has been addressed. By setting the output masks for Lambda layers to `None` explicitly, we ensure that the assertion for output tensor computation does not encounter issues.

### Outcome:
The corrected version of the `_clone_functional_model` function should now properly handle models with layers that do not support masks, such as Lambda layers. This fix should resolve the assertion error and allow the cloned model creation process to work correctly, addressing the reported bug in the GitHub issue as well.
