### Bug Analysis:
The bug occurs in the `_clone_functional_model` function when trying to clone a functional `Model` instance. The error message is raised when attempting to compute the output of the model during the cloning process. The issue is related to how the input tensors and layers are handled and mapped while creating the cloned model.

### Identified Errors:
1. The code incorrectly handles the input tensors when creating the cloned model, which leads to incorrect mapping and identification of input tensors during the cloning process.
2. There is a discrepancy in handling layers and input tensors in the function, which causes the error.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is caused by the incorrect mapping of input tensors and layers in the `layer_map` and `tensor_map` dictionaries. This incorrect mapping results in the failure to compute the output tensors of the model during the cloning process.

### Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, the input tensors and layers need to be correctly mapped and handled during the cloning process. Ensuring that the input tensors are properly associated with the corresponding layers and that the mapping is maintained throughout the function will resolve the issue.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
Here is the corrected version of the `_clone_functional_model` function:

```python
def _clone_functional_model(model, input_tensors=None):
    if not isinstance(model, Model):
        raise ValueError('Expected `model` argument to be a `Model` instance, got ', model)

    layer_map = {}
    tensor_map = {}

    if input_tensors is None:
        input_layers = []
        input_tensors = []
        for layer in model._input_layers:
            input_tensor = Input(batch_shape=layer.batch_input_shape,
                                 dtype=layer.dtype,
                                 sparse=layer.sparse,
                                 name=layer.name)
            input_tensors.append(input_tensor)
            layer_map[layer] = input_tensor
        for _original, _cloned in zip(model.inputs, input_tensors):
            layer_map[_original] = _cloned
    else:
        input_tensors = to_list(input_tensors)
        for i, x in enumerate(input_tensors):
            name = model._input_layers[i].name
            input_tensor = Input(tensor=x, name='input_wrapper_for_' + name)
            layer_map[model._input_layers[i]] = input_tensor

    for x, y in zip(model._input_layers, input_tensors):
        tensor_map[x] = (y, None)

    for layer in model.layers:
        if layer not in layer_map:
            new_layer = layer.__class__.from_config(layer.get_config())
            layer_map[layer] = new_layer

    for node in model._nodes_by_depth:
        layer = node.outbound_layer
        if layer not in layer_map:
            new_layer = layer.__class__.from_config(layer.get_config())
            layer_map[layer] = new_layer

    for node in model._nodes_by_depth:
        layer = layer_map[node.outbound_layer]
        reference_input_tensors = to_list(node.inbound_layers)
        reference_output_tensors = to_list(node.output_layers)

        computed_data = []
        for x in reference_input_tensors:
            if x in tensor_map:
                computed_data.append(tensor_map[x])

        if len(computed_data) == len(reference_input_tensors):
            kwargs = node.arguments if node.arguments else {}
            computed_tensors = [x[0] for x in computed_data]
            computed_masks = [x[1] for x in computed_data]
            output_tensors = to_list(layer(computed_tensors, **kwargs))
            tensor_map.update({x: (y, mask) for x, y, mask in zip(reference_output_tensors, output_tensors, [])})

    output_tensors = [tensor_map[x][0] for x in model.outputs]
    
    return Model(input_tensors, output_tensors, name=model.name)
```

### Conclusion:
The corrected version of the `_clone_functional_model` function should now handle the cloning of functional `Model` instances correctly and address the issue raised in the failing test. The function should now properly create a new model with new inputs, using newly instantiated weights.
