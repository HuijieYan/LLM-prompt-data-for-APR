### Analysis:
The `clone_model` function is calling the `_clone_functional_model` function to clone a functional model instance. The issue arises when the passed model is a `Sequential` model instead of a functional model. The code checks if the input model is a `Sequential` model but does not prevent the cloning process when it is a `Sequential` model. This leads to unexpected behavior and errors.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is caused by not properly handling the case when the input model is a `Sequential` model instead of a functional model. The code raises a `ValueError` when the model is an instance of `Sequential`, but it does not prevent the further execution of the cloning process.

### Proposed Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the `_clone_functional_model` function should not proceed with cloning if the input model is a `Sequential` model. We should raise an error and halt the process in this case.

### Updated Corrected Version:
```python
def _clone_functional_model(model, input_tensors=None):
    if not isinstance(model, Model):
        raise ValueError('Expected `model` argument to be a `Model` instance, got ', model)
    if isinstance(model, Sequential):
        raise ValueError('Expected `model` argument to be a functional `Model` instance, got a `Sequential` instance instead:', model)

    # Rest of the function remains unchanged
```

In the updated code, if the input model is a `Sequential` model, it will directly raise a `ValueError` without proceeding further with the cloning process. This will prevent any unexpected behavior and errors when trying to clone a `Sequential` model as if it were a functional model.
