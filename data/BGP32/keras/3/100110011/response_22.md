## Analyzing the buggy function and failing test code

The buggy function `_clone_functional_model` is designed to clone a functional `Model` instance by creating new layers and weights instead of sharing existing ones. The function has logic to create new placeholders if input tensors are not provided. However, there are issues with the implementation leading to the failing test `test_clone_functional_model_with_multi_outputs`.

The failing test creates a model with multiple outputs and attempts to clone it using `keras.models.clone_model` which internally calls the `_clone_functional_model` function. The error occurs during the cloning process, specifically when trying to compute the output tensors of the model. The error message indicates that the function fails to compute the output for a specific tensor.

## Potential error locations within the buggy function
1. Handling of input_tensors and creation of placeholders.
2. Computing output tensors by traversing the nodes in the reference model.
3. Checking and updating tensor_map for input/output tensors.
4. Assertion for computing model outputs at the end.

## Cause of the bug
The bug arises from incorrect handling of input_tensors and the subsequent traversal of nodes in the model during the cloning process. The failure to correctly map tensors and update tensor_map leads to the assertion error when computing the model outputs.

Additionally, the model in the failing test has multiple output tensors, which requires special handling during the cloning process.

## Strategy for fixing the bug
1. Ensure that input_tensors are correctly processed and mapped.
2. Properly update the tensor_map with input and output tensors.
3. Handle the case of models with multiple output tensors by ensuring the correct computation and mapping of tensors during the cloning process.

## Corrected version of the buggy function
```python
def _clone_functional_model(model, input_tensors=None):
    if not isinstance(model, Model):
        raise ValueError('Expected `model` argument to be a `Model` instance, got ', model)
    if isinstance(model, Sequential):
        raise ValueError('Expected `model` argument to be a functional `Model` instance, got a `Sequential` instance instead: ', model)

    layer_map = {}  # Cache for created layers.
    tensor_map = {}  # Map {reference_tensor: (corresponding_tensor, mask)}
    if input_tensors is None:
        input_tensors = [Input(shape=layer.input_shape[1:], name=layer.name) for layer in model.layers if isinstance(layer, InputLayer)]
    else:
        input_tensors = to_list(input_tensors)

    for layer in model.layers:
        if isinstance(layer, InputLayer):
            layer_map[layer] = layer
        else:
            config = layer.get_config()
            new_layer = layer.__class__.from_config(config)  # Clone layer
            layer_map[layer] = new_layer

    for node in model._nodes_by_depth.values():
        for node_id, node_data in node.items():
            outbound_layer = node_data['outbound_layer']
            if outbound_layer in layer_map:
                outbound_layer = layer_map[outbound_layer]

            inbound_tensors = [tensor_map[tensor] for tensor in node_data['input_tensors']]

            if len(inbound_tensors) == len(node_data['input_tensors']):
                kwargs = node_data.get('arguments', {})
                output_tensors = to_list(outbound_layer(inbound_tensors, **kwargs))

                for idx, output_tensor in enumerate(node_data['output_tensors']):
                    tensor_map[output_tensor] = output_tensors[idx]

    outputs = []
    for node_id, output_tensors in tensor_map.items():
        if node_id in model.outputs:
            outputs.append(output_tensors)

    return Model(inputs=input_tensors, outputs=outputs, name=model.name)
```

By updating the `_clone_functional_model` function with the corrections mentioned above, the function should now correctly clone functional models with multiple outputs, resolving the issue encountered in the failing test.
