### Analysis:
The buggy function `_clone_functional_model` is used to clone a functional model instance, creating new layers and weights instead of sharing existing ones. The function is raising an error when a `Sequential` model is passed as an argument. Additionally, the failing test `test_clone_functional_model_with_multi_outputs` is trying to clone a model with multiple outputs, leading to an assertion error when calling `keras.models.clone_model(model)`.

### Error Cause:
1. The function checks if the passed model is an instance of `Model`, but it should also exclude `Sequential` models that are not considered functional models.
   
2. The failing test creates a model with multiple outputs, using layers that do not support masks, causing issues in the layer computations during model cloning.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
1. Modify the function to properly handle cases where a `Sequential` model is passed as an argument.
   
2. Address the issue related to models with multiple outputs and layers lacking mask support by adjusting the model cloning logic accordingly.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def _clone_functional_model(model, input_tensors=None):
    if not isinstance(model, Model) or isinstance(model, Sequential):
        raise ValueError('Expected `model` argument to be a functional `Model` instance, got ', model)

    layer_map = {}
    tensor_map = {}

    if input_tensors is None:
        input_layers = []
        input_tensors = []
        for layer in model.input_layers:
            input_tensor = Input(batch_shape=layer.batch_input_shape, dtype=layer.dtype,
                                 sparse=layer.sparse, name=layer.name)
            input_tensors.append(input_tensor)
            layer_map[layer] = input_tensor

    for x, y in zip(model.inputs, input_tensors):
        tensor_map[x] = (y, None)

    # Clone the model's nodes and layers
    for node in model._nodes:
        layer = node.outbound_layer
        new_layer = layer.__class__.from_config(layer.get_config())
        layer_map[layer] = new_layer

        inputs = [tensor_map[x][0] for x in node.input_tensors]
        kwargs = node.arguments if node.arguments else {}
        outputs = to_list(new_layer(inputs, **kwargs))

        for x, y in zip(node.output_tensors, outputs):
            tensor_map[x] = (y, None)

    output_tensors = [tensor_map[x][0] for x in model.outputs]

    return Model(input_tensors, output_tensors, name=model.name)
```

By updating the function to handle `Sequential` models correctly and adjusting the model cloning process for models with multiple outputs and unique layers, the bug should be resolved.
