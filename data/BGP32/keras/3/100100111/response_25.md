### Issue Analysis:
- The buggy function `_clone_functional_model` is supposed to clone a functional `Model` instance. The issue arises when trying to clone a model with multiple outputs, such as in the failing test case `test_clone_functional_model_with_multi_outputs`.
- The failing test uses a `Lambda` layer with multiple outputs and a custom `Layer` called `SwapLayer` also with multiple outputs.
- The issue stems from the fact that the function fails to correctly handle the case of cloning a model with layers that produce multiple outputs without mask support.
- The failing test expects the same predictions from the original and cloned models, but due to the incorrect handling of layers with multiple outputs, the cloned model fails to produce the correct output.

### Error Location:
- The main issue lies within the handling of layers with multiple outputs that do not support masks. This can be seen in the failing test where the `SwapLayer` does not support using masks.
- Specifically, the problem arises in the section of the function where it builds the cloned model by iterating over nodes and processing each layer.

### Bug Cause:
- The bug is caused by the assumption that all output masks will be available, which is not the case for layers that do not support masks, like the `Lambda` and `Add` layers in the failing test. This assumption leads to an incorrect mapping of tensors, resulting in the incorrect output from the cloned model.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
- To fix this bug, the function `_clone_functional_model` needs to handle layers with multiple outputs correctly, especially those that do not support masks, by properly handling the computation of output tensors and masks in such cases.
- The function should check the mask support for each layer and adjust the logic accordingly when processing layers with multiple outputs.
- The output tensors and masks must be correctly computed and mapped to ensure the cloned model produces the expected output.

The corrected function includes adjustments to handle layers with multiple outputs correctly, ensuring that the cloned model will produce the expected output, especially in cases where layers do not support masks.
