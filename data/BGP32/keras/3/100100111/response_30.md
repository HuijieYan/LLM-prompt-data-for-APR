### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_clone_functional_model` is responsible for creating a new clone of a functional Keras model with newly instantiated weights.
2. The function tries to create new layers and input tensors based on the original model and input tensors provided.
3. The bug seems to be related to the creation of input tensors and input layers, which involves caching and mapping. The issue might lie in how input tensors and their corresponding layers are handled.
4. The failing test case `test_clone_functional_model_with_multi_outputs` tries to create a model with multiple input and output tensors and then clone it using `clone_model`. However, the function fails to handle this scenario correctly leading to an assertion error when comparing predictions from the original model and the cloned model.
5. The expected values and types at various points in the function and the failing test provide insights into the bug's cause.
6. The GitHub issue describes a similar problem related to the `clone_model` function when used in conjunction with `multi_gpu_model` and certain types of layers. The issue is linked to `compute_mask` returning `None` when a layer doesn't support masks, leading to an inability to compute the output tensor.

### Bugs and Causes:
1. Handling of input tensors and input layers is incorrect, leading to discrepancies in the mapping and caching process.
2. Incorrect handling of multiple input tensors and their corresponding layers.
3. Failure to correctly compute output tensors when certain layers do not support masks, leading to output masks being set to `None`.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
1. Ensure that input tensors and their corresponding layers are correctly cached and mapped.
2. Enhance the handling of multiple input tensors and input layers to prevent data loss.
3. Modify the logic related to computing output tensors to handle cases where layers do not support masks gracefully.

    return Model(input_tensors, output_tensors, name=model.name)
```

This corrected version enhances the logic related to input layers, input tensors, and the computation of output tensors. It ensures that input tensors and their corresponding layers are correctly cached and mapped, particularly when handling multiple input tensors and layers. Additionally, it properly computes output tensors even when layers do not support masks, preventing `None` values for output masks.
