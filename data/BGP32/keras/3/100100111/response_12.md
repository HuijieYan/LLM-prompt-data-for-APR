## Analysis:
1. The `clone_model` function in Keras is encountering an issue when working with models that have layers with multiple outputs, particularly when certain layers do not support masks.
2. The failing test case provided tries to clone a model with a `SwapLayer` that returns multiple outputs without mask support, leading to the `Could not compute output Tensor` error.
3. The issue arises when the function tries to compute the output masks for layers that do not support masking, resulting in `output_masks` being set to `None`.
4. The failing test case demonstrates the issue by creating a model with a `SwapLayer` that lacks mask support and then cloning it using `clone_model`.
5. To fix the bug, we need to ensure proper handling of layers without mask support during the cloning process.

## Solution:
1. Modify the `_clone_functional_model` function to check for layers without mask support and handle them appropriately.
2. Update the code to skip the computation of masks for layers that do not support masking.
3. For layers without mask support, set the `output_masks` to `None` to prevent the `Could not compute output Tensor` error.

## The corrected function:

```python
def _clone_functional_model(model, input_tensors=None):
    if not isinstance(model, Model):
        raise ValueError('Expected `model` argument to be a `Model` instance, got ', model)
    if isinstance(model, Sequential):
        raise ValueError('Expected `model` argument to be a functional `Model` instance, got a `Sequential` instance instead:', model)

    layer_map = {}  
    tensor_map = {}  
    ...
   
    for depth in depth_keys:
        nodes = model._nodes_by_depth[depth]
        for node in nodes:
            layer = node.outbound_layer

            if layer not in layer_map:
                new_layer = layer.__class__.from_config(layer.get_config())
                layer_map[layer] = new_layer
                layer = new_layer
            else:
                layer = layer_map[layer]
                if isinstance(layer, InputLayer):
                    continue

            reference_input_tensors = node.input_tensors
            reference_output_tensors = node.output_tensors

            computed_data = []  
            for x in reference_input_tensors:
                if x in tensor_map:
                    computed_data.append(tensor_map[x])

            if len(computed_data) == len(reference_input_tensors):
                if node.arguments:
                    kwargs = node.arguments
                else:
                    kwargs = {}
                if len(computed_data) == 1:
                    computed_tensor, _ = computed_data[0]
                    computed_tensors = [computed_tensor]
                else:
                    computed_tensors = [x[0] for x in computed_data]
                
                # Call layer.
                output_tensors = to_list(layer(computed_tensors, **kwargs))
                # Update tensor_map.
                for x, y in zip(reference_output_tensors, output_tensors):
                    tensor_map[x] = (y, None)  

    output_tensors = []
    for x in model.outputs:
        assert x in tensor_map, 'Could not compute output ' + str(x)
        tensor, _ = tensor_map[x]
        output_tensors.append(tensor)
    return Model(input_tensors, output_tensors, name=model.name)
```

By updating the function to handle layers without mask support properly and setting `output_masks` to `None` for those layers, the corrected function addresses the issue with models having layers with multiple outputs.
