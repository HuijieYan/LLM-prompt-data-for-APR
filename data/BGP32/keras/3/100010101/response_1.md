### Bug analysis:
The buggy function `_clone_functional_model` is failing due to an incorrect check for the type of `model`. The function is expecting an instance of `Model` class but encounters a `Sequential` instance instead during the test execution.

The error occurs because the function checks if `model` is not an instance of `Model` and raises an error. However, it should check if `model` is an instance of `Sequential` to raise the proper error message.

### Bug fix strategy:
1. Change the condition in the function to check if `model` is an instance of `Sequential` instead of `Model`.
2. Modify the error message to inform the user that a `Sequential` instance was provided.

### Corrected function:
```python
def _clone_functional_model(model, input_tensors=None):
    """Clone a functional `Model` instance.

    Model cloning is similar to calling a model on new inputs,
    except that it creates new layers (and thus new weights) instead
    of sharing the weights of the existing layers.

    # Arguments
        model: Instance of `Model`.
        input_tensors: optional list of input tensors
            to build the model upon. If not provided,
            placeholders will be created.

    # Returns
        An instance of `Model` reproducing the behavior
        of the original model, on top of new inputs tensors,
        using newly instantiated weights.

    # Raises
        ValueError: in case of invalid `model` argument value.
    """
    if not isinstance(model, Model):
        raise ValueError('Expected `model` argument '
                         'to be a `Model` instance, got ', model)
    if isinstance(model, Sequential):
        raise ValueError('Expected `model` argument '
                         'to be a functional `Model` instance, '
                         'got a `Sequential` instance instead:', model)

    layer_map = {}  # Cache for created layers.
    tensor_map = {}  # Map {reference_tensor: (corresponding_tensor, mask)}
  
    # Remaining implementation...
  
    return Model(input_tensors, output_tensors, name=model.name)
```

By making the above improvements, the corrected function should now properly handle sequential models and raise the appropriate error messages when necessary.
