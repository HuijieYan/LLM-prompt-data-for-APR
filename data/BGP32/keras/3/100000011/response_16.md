### Analysis:
The buggy function `_clone_functional_model` is used to clone a functional Keras model instance. The function encounters an error when trying to compute the output tensors, which leads to the `Could not compute output Tensor` error mentioned in the GitHub issue. The error seems to be related to the processing of masks for the output tensors.

### Error Location:
The error is likely occurring in the section where the function handles the output tensors and masks. Specifically, the issue seems to be related to the handling of masks when calling the layers, especially when dealing with multiple outputs from a layer that does not support masks.

### Cause of the Bug:
The bug arises from the fact that certain layers in the model (like `Lambda` in the example provided in the GitHub issue) do not support masks, leading to `output_masks` being `None`. This discrepancy in mask handling causes the error during the computation of output tensors.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, the handling of masks needs to be adjusted to account for layers that do not support masks. The code should be updated to properly handle cases where the output masks might be `None`.

### Correction:
Here is the corrected version of the `_clone_functional_model` function based on the identified issue:

```python
def _clone_functional_model(model, input_tensors=None):
    # existing code...
    
    for x, y in zip(model.inputs, input_tensors):
        tensor_map[x] = (y, None)  # tensor, mask

    # existing code...

    for x, y, mask in zip(reference_output_tensors, output_tensors, output_masks):
        if mask is None:
            mask = None  # Handle the case where the mask is None
        tensor_map[x] = (y, mask)

    # Check that we did compute the model outputs,
    # then instantiate a new model from inputs and outputs.
    output_tensors = []
    for x in model.outputs:
        assert x in tensor_map, 'Could not compute output ' + str(x)
        tensor, mask = tensor_map[x]
        output_tensors.append(tensor)
    return Model(input_tensors, output_tensors, name=model.name)
```

By updating the way masks are handled during the computation of output tensors, this corrected version of the function should resolve the issue reported in the GitHub bug.
