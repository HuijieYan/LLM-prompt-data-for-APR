### Analysis:
The bug reported in the GitHub issue is related to the `clone_model()` function in Keras. The error occurs when using `multi_gpu_model` with `cpu_relocation=True`, which internally uses `clone_model`. The issue seems to stem from the fact that the `clone_model` function may not handle certain cases correctly when dealing with layers that do not support masks.

### Error Location:
The bug is likely to be in the `_clone_functional_model` function in the `keras.models` module, specifically in the part where output masks are computed for layers that do not support masks.

### Cause of the Bug:
The bug arises due to the `output_masks` variable always being set to `None` because the layers generated by the `lambda` function do not support masks. This results in the `AssertionError` being raised when trying to compute the output tensor.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to modify the way output masks are computed for layers that do not support masks. We can handle this by checking if the layer has a `compute_mask` method and only computing masks if the method exists.

### Corrected Version:
Below is the corrected version of the `_clone_functional_model` function that addresses the bug:

```python
def _clone_functional_model(model, input_tensors=None):
    if not isinstance(model, Model):
        raise ValueError('Expected `model` argument to be a `Model` instance, got ', model)

    if isinstance(model, Sequential):
        raise ValueError('Expected `model` argument to be a functional `Model` instance, got a `Sequential` instance instead:', model)

    layer_map = {}  # Cache for created layers.
    tensor_map = {}  # Map {reference_tensor: (corresponding_tensor, mask)}

    # Rest of the function remains the same until the loop where masks are computed

    # Iterated over every node in the reference model, in depth order.
    depth_keys = list(model._nodes_by_depth.keys())
    depth_keys.sort(reverse=True)
    for depth in depth_keys:
        nodes = model._nodes_by_depth[depth]
        for node in nodes:
            # Rest of the loop remains the same

            # Check if the layer supports masks
            if hasattr(layer, 'compute_mask'):
                output_masks = to_list(
                    layer.compute_mask(computed_tensors, computed_masks))

                # Update tensor_map
                for x, y, mask in zip(reference_output_tensors, output_tensors, output_masks):
                    tensor_map[x] = (y, mask)
            else:
                # Update tensor_map without computing masks
                for x, y in zip(reference_output_tensors, output_tensors):
                    tensor_map[x] = (y, None)

    # Rest of the function remains the same

```

This corrected version ensures that masks are only computed if the layer supports it, or else it updates the tensor map without the mask. This change should address the issue reported in the GitHub bug.
