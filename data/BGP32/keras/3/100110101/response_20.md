### Bug Analysis:
The bug in the `_clone_functional_model` function arises from incorrectly checking the type of the input `model`. The function first checks if the input `model` is an instance of `keras.engine.training.Model`, and this check should be sufficient. However, the subsequent check wrongly treats a `Sequential` model as an instance of `Model`, leading to a `ValueError` being raised in the case of a `Sequential` model. This is incorrect behavior since a `Sequential` model is not considered a functional `Model` instance.

### Bug Fix:
To fix the bug, we need to remove the unnecessary type check for `Sequential` and rely solely on checking if the input `model` is an instance of `Model`. This will enable the function to appropriately handle functional models and avoid raising errors for `Sequential` models.

### Updated Function:
```python
def _clone_functional_model(model, input_tensors=None):
    """Clone a functional `Model` instance.

    Model cloning is similar to calling a model on new inputs, except that it creates new layers (and thus new weights) instead of sharing the weights of the existing layers.

    # Arguments
        model: Instance of `Model`.
        input_tensors: optional list of input tensors to build the model upon. If not provided, placeholders will be created.

    # Returns
        An instance of `Model` reproducing the behavior of the original model, on top of new inputs tensors, using newly instantiated weights.

    # Raises
        ValueError: in case of invalid `model` argument value.
    """
    if not isinstance(model, Model):
        raise ValueError('Expected `model` argument to be a `Model` instance, got ', model)

    layer_map = {}  # Cache for created layers.
    tensor_map = {}  # Map {reference_tensor: (corresponding_tensor, mask)}
    
    # Remaining code remains the same
    ...
```

By updating the function as shown above, we ensure that only instances of `Model` will pass the initial type check and proceed with the cloning process correctly.
