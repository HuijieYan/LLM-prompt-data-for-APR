### Identified Bug
The bug in the `_clone_functional_model` function is that it incorrectly checks whether the input `model` is an instance of `Sequential` before checking if it is an instance of `Model`. Since `Sequential` is a subclass of `Model`, the condition for `Sequential` is always triggered, leading to an erroneous exception being raised even if the input model is a functional `Model`.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug
To fix the bug, we should first check if the input `model` is an instance of `Sequential` before checking if it is an instance of the base class `Model`. This change in order of condition checking will ensure that the correct exception is raised when necessary.

### Corrected Function
```python
def _clone_functional_model(model, input_tensors=None):
    if not isinstance(model, Model):
        raise ValueError('Expected `model` argument to be a `Model` instance, got ', model)
    if isinstance(model, Sequential):
        raise ValueError('Expected `model` argument to be a functional `Model` instance, got a `Sequential` instance instead:', model)

    # Rest of the function remains the same...
}
``` 

By changing the order of condition checking, we ensure that the correct error is raised when `model` is incorrectly specified as a `Sequential` instance instead of a functional `Model`. This correction will fix the bug and allow the function to work correctly.
