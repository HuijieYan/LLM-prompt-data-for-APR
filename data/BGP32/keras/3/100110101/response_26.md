### Identified Bug:

The bug arises from the function `_clone_functional_model` not correctly handling a possible `Sequential` model instance, which causes an assertion error when attempting to clone the model. 

1. The function does not correctly validate the input model type, leading to incorrect type checks on the `model` argument. It should not only check if the model is an instance of `Model` but also exclude instances of `Sequential`.
2. The function does not properly handle the case where the input tensors are not provided, leading to issues in placeholder creation. 

### Fix Strategy:

1. Add a check to ensure that only instances of `Model` are accepted, excluding `Sequential` instances.
2. Adjust the logic for creating input tensors in case `input_tensors` is None to prevent errors in creating placeholders.

### Corrected Function:

```python
def _clone_functional_model(model, input_tensors=None):
    if not isinstance(model, Model):
        raise ValueError('Expected `model` argument to be a `Model` instance, got:', model)
    if isinstance(model, Sequential):
        raise ValueError('Expected `model` argument to be a functional `Model` instance, got a `Sequential` instance instead:', model)

    if model.inputs and input_tensors is None:
        input_tensors = [Input(batch_shape=layer.input_shape[1:], dtype=layer.input_spec.dtype) for layer in model.layers if isinstance(layer, InputLayer)]

    # Rest of the function logic unchanged
``` 

With this correction, the function will properly handle the input model and the condition where input tensors are not provided. This should resolve the assertion error encountered in the failing test.
