### Bug Analysis:
The bug occurs because the function `_clone_functional_model` is expecting `model` to be an instance of `Model`, but in the failing test, `model` is an instance of `Model`, which does not satisfy the condition. This leads to the value of `model` being incorrect and causes an assertion error during the execution of the function.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix this bug, we need to correct the condition checking the type of `model` by using `isinstance(model, Model)` instead of checking if it is not an instance of `Model`. Additionally, we need to modify the comparison of `model` with `Sequential` to ensure that the correct instance of `Model` is used for the cloning operation.

### The corrected function:
```python
def _clone_functional_model(model, input_tensors=None):
    if not isinstance(model, Model):
        raise ValueError('Expected `model` argument to be a `Model` instance, got {}'.format(model))
    if isinstance(model, Sequential):
        raise ValueError('Expected `model` argument to be a functional `Model` instance, got a `Sequential` instance instead: {}'.format(model)

    # Rest of the function remains unchanged
    ...
```

After making this correction, the function should be able to successfully clone the model without raising any errors.
