### Bug Analysis:
- The bug occurs in the `_clone_functional_model` function when checking the input model type. The function raises a ValueError if the input model is not an instance of the `Model` class. However, it fails to account for the case where the input model is an instance of the `Sequential` class, leading to an incorrect error message and failure.
- The buggy function does not properly handle the case where the input model is a `Sequential` instance, resulting in an error message that incorrectly identifies the issue.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
- To fix the bug, we need to modify the type check condition to include a check for instances of the `Sequential` class before the main check for `Model` instances.
- If the input is a `Sequential` instance, we should raise a ValueError with the corresponding error message.
- We also need to ensure that the correct error messages are raised for the expected input types to avoid confusion.

### The corrected function:
```python
def _clone_functional_model(model, input_tensors=None):
    """Clone a functional `Model` instance.

    Model cloning is similar to calling a model on new inputs,
    except that it creates new layers (and thus new weights) instead
    of sharing the weights of the existing layers.

    # Arguments
        model: Instance of `Model`.
        input_tensors: optional list of input tensors
            to build the model upon. If not provided,
            placeholders will be created.

    # Returns
        An instance of `Model` reproducing the behavior
        of the original model, on top of new inputs tensors,
        using newly instantiated weights.

    # Raises
        ValueError: in case of invalid `model` argument value.
    """
    if not isinstance(model, Model):
        raise ValueError('Expected `model` argument '
                         'to be a `Model` instance, got ', model)
    if isinstance(model, Sequential):
        raise ValueError('Expected `model` argument '
                         'to be a functional `Model` instance, '
                         'got a `Sequential` instance instead:', model)

    # The remaining code remains the same
```

With this correction, the function will correctly identify the input model as a `Sequential` instance and raise the appropriate error message.
