### Correction of the Bug

#### Cause of the Bug
The bug occurs because the function `_clone_functional_model` checks if the input `model` is an instance of `Model` or `Sequential` using `isinstance`. However, the error arises from an incorrect check when comparing the model to `Sequential`. The correct comparison should be checking if the model is an instance of `Sequential` before checking if it is an instance of `Model`.

#### Fixing the Bug
To fix the bug, we need to first check if the input model is an instance of `Sequential` and raise an error accordingly. Then, we can check if it is an instance of `Model` before proceeding with the cloning process.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _clone_functional_model(model, input_tensors=None):
    """Clone a functional `Model` instance.

    Model cloning is similar to calling a model on new inputs,
    except that it creates new layers (and thus new weights) instead
    of sharing the weights of the existing layers.

    # Arguments
        model: Instance of `Model`.
        input_tensors: optional list of input tensors
            to build the model upon. If not provided,
            placeholders will be created.

    # Returns
        An instance of `Model` reproducing the behavior
        of the original model, on top of new inputs tensors,
        using newly instantiated weights.

    # Raises
        ValueError: in case of invalid `model` argument value.
    """
    if isinstance(model, Sequential):
        raise ValueError('Expected `model` argument '
                         'to be a functional `Model` instance, '
                         'got a `Sequential` instance instead:', model)
    if not isinstance(model, Model):
        raise ValueError('Expected `model` argument '
                         'to be a `Model` instance, got ', model)

    # rest of the function remains unchanged
```

With this correction in place, the function should now correctly handle instances of `Sequential` before proceeding to clone instances of `Model`.
