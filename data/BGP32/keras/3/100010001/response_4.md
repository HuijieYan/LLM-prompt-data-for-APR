## Analysis:
- The error occurs when trying to clone a model with multiple outputs.
- The error is raised at the end of the `_clone_functional_model` function when checking if all model outputs have been computed.

## Bug Cause:
- The bug is caused by incorrect handling of multiple output tensors in the `_clone_functional_model` function.
- The function does not properly handle multiple outputs from layers, which results in the assertion error when trying to compute the model outputs.

## Correction Strategy:
- Ensure that all outputs of the model are computed correctly during the cloning process.
- Handle multiple outputs from layers appropriately.
- Update the logic for computing the model outputs based on the multiple output tensors.

## Corrected Function:

```python
def _clone_functional_model(model, input_tensors=None):
    if not isinstance(model, Model):
        raise ValueError('Expected `model` argument to be a `Model` instance, got ', model)
    if isinstance(model, Sequential):
        raise ValueError('Expected `model` argument to be a functional `Model` instance, '
                         'got a `Sequential` instance instead:', model)

    layer_map = {}  
    tensor_map = {}  
    if input_tensors is None: 
        input_tensors = [Input(shape=layer.output_shape[1:]) for layer in model.layers if layer.__class__.__name__ == 'InputLayer']
    for layer in model.layers:
        layer_config = layer.get_config()
        new_layer = layer.__class__.from_config(layer_config)
        layer_map[layer] = new_layer
    tensor_map = {original_tensor: new_tensor for original_tensor, new_tensor in zip(model.inputs, input_tensors)}

    for layer in model.layers:
        new_layer = layer_map[layer]
        inbound_layers = [layer_map.get(node.outbound_layer, node.outbound_layer) for node in layer._inbound_nodes]
        if not isinstance(new_layer, InputLayer):
            new_layer(inbound_layers)

    output_tensors = [tensor_map.get(output, output) for output in model.outputs]
    return Model(input_tensors, output_tensors, name=model.name)
```

By correcting the `_clone_functional_model` function with the above code, the model cloning process should now handle multiple output tensors correctly and pass the failing test.
