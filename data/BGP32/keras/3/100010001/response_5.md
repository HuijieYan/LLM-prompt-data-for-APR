### Analysis:
The buggy function, `_clone_functional_model`, is intended to clone a functional `Model` instance by creating new layers and weights. The function takes in a `Model` instance and an optional list of input tensors and returns a cloned `Model` instance. The bug seems to be related to the way the function handles the input layers when cloning the model.

### Bug Location:
The bug seems to be in the handling of input layers where the function is not correctly assigning the newly created input tensors to the input layers.

### Cause of the Bug:
The bug is caused by the way the function `_clone_functional_model` handles the creation of input_tensors when `input_tensors` is None. It creates the `input_tensor` objects correctly but doesn't assign them to `input_layers` list which is later used for mapping with the original input layers. This results in missing mappings between original input layers and newly created input layers.

### Bug Fix:
To fix the bug, we need to update the code to correctly assign the newly created input tensors to the `input_layers` list for mapping with the original input layers.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def _clone_functional_model(model, input_tensors=None):
    if not isinstance(model, Model):
        raise ValueError('Expected `model` argument to be a `Model` instance, got ', model)
    if isinstance(model, Sequential):
        raise ValueError('Expected `model` argument to be a functional `Model` instance, got a `Sequential` instance instead:', model)

    layer_map = {}  
    tensor_map = {}  
    
    if input_tensors is None:
        input_layers = []  # Initialize input_layers list
        input_tensors = []
        for layer in model._input_layers:
            input_tensor = Input(batch_shape=layer.batch_input_shape,
                                 dtype=layer.dtype,
                                 sparse=layer.sparse,
                                 name=layer.name)
            input_layers.append(input_tensor)  # Append input_tensor to input_layers
            # Cache newly created input layer.
            newly_created_input_layer = input_tensor._keras_history[0]
            layer_map[layer] = newly_created_input_layer
        for _original, _cloned in zip(model._input_layers, input_layers):
            layer_map[_original] = _cloned  # Update layer_map with original and cloned input layers

    else:
        # Remaining code remains the same

    # Remaining code remains the same
```

This corrected version correctly maintains the mapping between the original input layers and the newly created input layers.
