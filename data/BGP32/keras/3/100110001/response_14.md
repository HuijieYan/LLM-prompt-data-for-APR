### Analysis:
1. The error message indicates that the `assert` statement in the `_clone_functional_model` function fails due to not being able to compute the output for a specific tensor (`Tensor("swap_layer_1/Identity:0", shape=(?, 4), dtype=float32)`).
2. The error is likely related to the logic for handling input tensors and their corresponding mappings in the function.
3. The function is designed to clone a functional model instance but seems to be encountering an issue when dealing with multiple input and output tensors.
   
### Bug:
The bug seems to stem from the incorrect handling of input tensors and mappings in the `_clone_functional_model` function, leading to an error in computing the output tensors.

### Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the input tensors and their mappings are correctly handled and used when creating the new model. We should also verify that all output tensors can be computed successfully based on the input data.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def _clone_functional_model(model, input_tensors=None):
    if not isinstance(model, Model):
        raise ValueError('Expected `model` argument to be a `Model` instance, got ', model)
    if isinstance(model, Sequential):
        raise ValueError('Expected `model` argument to be a functional `Model` instance, '
                         'got a `Sequential` instance instead:', model)

    layer_map = {}  # Cache for created layers.
    tensor_map = {}  # Map {reference_tensor: (corresponding_tensor, mask)}
    
    if input_tensors is None:
        # Create placeholders to build the model on top of.
        input_tensors = []
        for layer in model.input_layers:
            input_tensor = Input(batch_shape=layer.batch_input_shape,
                                 dtype=layer.dtype,
                                 sparse=layer.sparse,
                                 name=layer.name)
            input_tensors.append(input_tensor)
            layer_map[layer] = input_tensor

    for i, x in enumerate(model.inputs):
        if input_tensors and i < len(input_tensors):
            tensor_map[x] = (input_tensors[i], None)  # tensor, mask
        else:
            tensor_map[x] = (x, None)

    for depth in range(len(model._nodes_by_depth) - 1, -1, -1):
        nodes = model._nodes_by_depth[depth]
        for node in nodes:
            inbound_layers = [layer_map[x] for x in node.inbound_layers]

            kwargs = node.arguments if node.arguments is not None else {}
            computed_tensors = []
            for x in inbound_layers:
                if x in tensor_map:
                    computed_tensors.append(tensor_map[x][0])

            if len(computed_tensors) == len(inbound_layers):
                new_output_tensors = node.outbound_layer(computed_tensors, **kwargs)

                if not isinstance(new_output_tensors, list):
                    new_output_tensors = [new_output_tensors]

                outbound_nodes = model._outbound_nodes[node.outbound_layer]
                for i, x in enumerate(outbound_nodes):
                    tensor_map[x] = (new_output_tensors[i], None)
    
    output_tensors = [tensor_map[x][0] for x in model.outputs]
    return Model(input_tensors, output_tensors, name=model.name)
```

The corrected version focuses on ensuring that input tensors are correctly mapped and effectively used in computing the output tensors for the new model. This fix should address the issue encountered in the failing test.
