### Analysis:
The `clone_model` function is calling the `_clone_functional_model` function with the `model` as an argument. However, the `_clone_functional_model` function is expecting an instance of `Model` as input but is not handling the case for `Sequential` instances properly. The error occurs when a `Sequential` model is passed as input.

### Bug Explanation:
The bug occurs because the code does not handle the case where the input model is a `Sequential` model properly. It raises a `ValueError` stating that it expects a functional `Model` instance but receives a `Sequential` instance instead.

### Bug Fix:
To fix the bug, we need to modify the `_clone_functional_model` function to handle the case where the input model is a `Sequential` instance separately. We should raise an appropriate error in that case.

### Corrected Function:
```python
def _clone_functional_model(model, input_tensors=None):
    if not isinstance(model, Model):
        raise ValueError('Expected `model` argument to be a `Model` instance, got ', model)
    
    if isinstance(model, Sequential):
        raise ValueError('Expected `model` argument to be a functional `Model` instance, got a `Sequential` instance instead:', model)

    # Rest of the function implementation...
```
