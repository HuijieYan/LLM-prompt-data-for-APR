## Analysis:
1. The `ValueError` is raised within the `_clone_functional_model` function when trying to clone a model.
2. The error occurs when the function checks if the input `model` is an instance of the `Model` class and is not a `Sequential` model.
3. The error message indicates that the model being provided as input is not being correctly identified.
4. The cloning logic inside the function is not handling the `Sequential` case properly, leading to the error.

## Bug Cause:
The bug occurs because the function incorrectly checks if the provided `model` is an instance of the `Sequential` class without first checking if it is an instance of the `Model` class. This leads to the function trying to clone a `Sequential` model as if it were a functional model.

## Fix Strategy:
1. Correct the logic to first check if the provided `model` is an instance of the `Model` class before checking if it is a `Sequential` model.
2. Handle the case of cloning a functional model separately from a `Sequential` model.

## Corrected Function:
```python
def _clone_functional_model(model, input_tensors=None):
    if not isinstance(model, Model):
        raise ValueError('Expected `model` argument to be a `Model` instance, got ', model)
    if isinstance(model, Sequential):
        raise ValueError('Expected `model` argument to be a functional `Model` instance, got a `Sequential` instance instead:', model)

    layer_map = {}
    tensor_map = {}
  
    # The rest of the function logic...

    # Check that we did compute the model outputs,
    # then instantiate a new model from inputs and outputs.
    output_tensors = []
    for x in model.outputs:
        if x not in tensor_map:
            raise ValueError('Could not compute output ', x)
        tensor, _ = tensor_map[x]
        output_tensors.append(tensor)
    return Model(input_tensors, output_tensors, name=model.name)
```

By fixing the logic to correctly check the type of the `model` input, the function will be able to handle the cloning of functional models correctly and avoid the error scenario encountered in the failing test.
