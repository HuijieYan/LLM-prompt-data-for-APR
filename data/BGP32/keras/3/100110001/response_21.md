### Analysis:
- The buggy function `_clone_functional_model` is responsible for cloning a functional `Model` instance by creating new layers and new weights instead of sharing the weights of the existing layers.
- The failing test `test_clone_functional_model_with_multi_outputs` is trying to clone a model with multiple outputs, but it fails with an error related to not being able to compute the output during the cloning process.
- The error message indicates that the failure happens while trying to compute the model outputs, specifically during the assertion that checks if a particular output tensor is computed successfully.
- The error occurs when the function tries to find the output tensor in the `tensor_map` dictionary but can't locate it, leading to an assertion failure.
- This issue points to a problem in the mapping of input and output tensors during the cloning process.

### Bug Explanation:
- The bug in the `_clone_functional_model` function arises from incorrect mapping of input and output tensors during the cloning process.
- When trying to loop over the model outputs and check if the output tensor is present in the `tensor_map` dictionary, the function fails to find the computed tensor for a specific output, resulting in the assertion error.
- This error indicates that the mapping of tensors in the `tensor_map` dictionary is not done correctly, causing a discrepancy between the actual outputs and the computed outputs.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
- To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the input and output tensors are correctly mapped in the `tensor_map` dictionary during the cloning process.
- The function should properly track the computed tensors and update the `tensor_map` with the correct mappings for both input and output tensors.
- The issue most likely lies in the process of capturing the computed tensors and masks and updating the `tensor_map` accordingly for each node in the model.

    output_tensors = [tensor_map[out][0] for out in model.outputs]
    
    return Model(input_tensors, output_tensors, name=model.name)
``` 

After applying these fixes, the updated `_clone_functional_model` function should be able to properly clone the functional `Model` instance with correct tensor mappings, successfully passing the failing test `test_clone_functional_model_with_multi_outputs`.
