The bug in the `_clone_functional_model` function seems to be related to the incorrect handling of input tensors and layer mappings. The function fails to correctly map input tensors and layers, resulting in a discrepancy while creating the new model.

To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the input tensors and their corresponding layers are properly mapped and managed throughout the function. Specifically, we need to update the way input tensors are created and cached, as well as how layers are cloned and reused.

Here is the corrected version of the `_clone_functional_model` function:

```python
def _clone_functional_model(model, input_tensors=None):
    """Clone a functional `Model` instance.
    
    # Arguments
        model: Instance of `Model`.
        input_tensors: optional list of input tensors
            to build the model upon. If not provided,
            placeholders will be created.
    
    # Returns
        An instance of `Model` reproducing the behavior
        of the original model, on top of new inputs tensors,
        using newly instantiated weights.
    
    # Raises
        ValueError: in case of invalid `model` argument value.
    """
    if not isinstance(model, Model):
        raise ValueError('Expected `model` argument to be a `Model` instance, got ', model)
    
    layer_map = {}  # Cache for created layers
    tensor_map = {}  # Map {reference_tensor: (corresponding_tensor, mask)}
    
    if input_tensors is None:
        input_tensors = [Input(tensor=layer.output) for layer in model.layers]
    else:
        input_tensors = to_list(input_tensors)
    
    for input_tensor, original_layer in zip(input_tensors, model.layers):
        layer_map[original_layer] = input_tensor._keras_history[0]
    
    for layer in model.layers:
        if layer not in layer_map:
            new_layer = layer.__class__.from_config(layer.get_config())
            layer_map[layer] = new_layer
    
    for original_layer, cloned_layer in layer_map.items():
        if isinstance(cloned_layer, InputLayer):
            continue
        if cloned_layer not in tensor_map:
            tensor_map[original_layer.output] = (cloned_layer(input_tensors), None)
    
    output_tensors = [tensor_map[output] for output in model.outputs]
    
    return Model(inputs=input_tensors, outputs=output_tensors, name=model.name)
```

This corrected version ensures proper mapping of input tensors and layers, creating a new functional model based on the original model but with newly instantiated weights. It addresses the issues identified in the buggy function and should satisfy the expected input/output values for the provided test case.
