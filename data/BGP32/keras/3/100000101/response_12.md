The bug in the `_clone_functional_model` function lies in the creation and handling of `input_layers` and `input_tensors`. Specifically, in the section where new input layers are created and caching of input layers is done. The bug causes incorrect mapping of input tensors to the corresponding layers, leading to missing input tensors during the model cloning process.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the correct input layers are cached and that the mapping of input tensors to their corresponding layers is accurate. This can be achieved by creating new input layers for input tensors if they are not originating from a Keras layer, and correctly caching the newly created input layers. Additionally, the loop that creates new input layers should be aligned with the actual input layers to ensure proper mapping.

Here is the corrected version of the `_clone_functional_model` function:

```python
def _clone_functional_model(model, input_tensors=None):
    if not isinstance(model, Model):
        raise ValueError('Expected `model` argument to be a `Model` instance, got ', model)
    if isinstance(model, Sequential):
        raise ValueError('Expected `model` argument to be a functional `Model` instance, got a `Sequential` instance instead:', model)

    layer_map = {}  # Cache for created layers.
    tensor_map = {}  # Map {reference_tensor: (corresponding_tensor, mask)}
    if input_tensors is None:
        # Create placeholders to build the model on top of.
        input_layers = []
        input_tensors = []
        for layer in model._input_layers:
            input_tensor = Input(batch_shape=layer.batch_input_shape,
                                 dtype=layer.dtype,
                                 sparse=layer.sparse,
                                 name=layer.name)
            input_tensors.append(input_tensor)
            # Cache newly created input layer.
            newly_created_input_layer = input_tensor._keras_history[0]
            layer_map[layer] = newly_created_input_layer
            input_layers.append(newly_created_input_layer)
    else:
        # Make sure that all input tensors come from a Keras layer.
        # If tensor comes from an input layer: cache the input layer.
        input_tensors = to_list(input_tensors)
        _input_tensors = []
        for i, x in enumerate(input_tensors):
            if not K.is_keras_tensor(x):
                name = model._input_layers[i].name
                input_tensor = Input(tensor=x,
                                     name='input_wrapper_for_' + name)
                _input_tensors.append(input_tensor)
                # Cache newly created input layer.
                original_input_layer = x._keras_history[0]
                newly_created_input_layer = input_tensor._keras_history[0]
                layer_map[model._input_layers[i]] = newly_created_input_layer
            else:
                _input_tensors.append(x)
        input_tensors = _input_tensors

    for x, y in zip(model.inputs, input_tensors):
        tensor_map[x] = (y, None)  # tensor, mask

    # Rest of the function stays the same

    return Model(input_layers, output_tensors, name=model.name)
```

This corrected version ensures that the input layers and input tensors are correctly aligned, and the mapping between them is accurate, considering the expected values and types mentioned in the failing test case.
