### Correction Strategy:
1. The current implementation of `_clone_functional_model` is failing because it raises a ValueError when the input `model` is an instance of `Sequential` instead of a functional `Model`.
2. The correction strategy involves ensuring that the input `model` is not an instance of `Sequential`. To achieve this, we need to remove the check for `Sequential` and focus solely on the type check for `Model`.
3. The remaining logic in the function should work correctly as long as the provided model is a functional Model instance.
4. By making this change, we can address the issue raised in the GitHub bug report and ensure that the function works as expected for functional models.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def _clone_functional_model(model, input_tensors=None):
    """Clone a functional `Model` instance.

    Model cloning is similar to calling a model on new inputs,
    except that it creates new layers (and thus new weights) instead
    of sharing the weights of the existing layers.

    # Arguments
        model: Instance of `Model`.
        input_tensors: optional list of input tensors
            to build the model upon. If not provided,
            placeholders will be created.

    # Returns
        An instance of `Model` reproducing the behavior
        of the original model, on top of new inputs tensors,
        using newly instantiated weights.

    # Raises
        ValueError: in case of invalid `model` argument value.
    """
    if not isinstance(model, Model):
        raise ValueError('Expected `model` argument to be a `Model` instance, got ', model)

    layer_map = {}  # Cache for created layers.
    tensor_map = {}  # Map {reference_tensor: (corresponding_tensor, mask)}
    if input_tensors is None:
        ## Remaining code remains the same...
```

By making this correction and removing the check for `Sequential`, the function should now work correctly for the provided model and address the issue highlighted in the GitHub report.
