### Bug Explanation:
The bug in the `_preprocess_numpy_input` function occurs when the `mode` parameter is set to `'caffe'` or `'torch'` and the `data_format` is set to `'channels_first'`. In these cases, the function incorrectly calculates the mean subtraction and normalization for the input array `x`. This leads to incorrect preprocess results in the failing test cases.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to adjust the calculation of mean subtraction and normalization for the input array `x` when `mode` is set to `'caffe'` or `'torch'` and `data_format` is set to `'channels_first'`.

### Corrected Function:

```python
import numpy as np

def _preprocess_numpy_input(x, data_format, mode):
    """Preprocesses a Numpy array encoding a batch of images.

    # Arguments
        x: Input array, 3D or 4D.
        data_format: Data format of the image array.
        mode: One of "caffe", "tf" or "torch".
            - caffe: will convert the images from RGB to BGR,
                then will zero-center each color channel with
                respect to the ImageNet dataset,
                without scaling.
            - tf: will scale pixels between -1 and 1,
                sample-wise.
            - torch: will scale pixels between 0 and 1 and then
                will normalize each channel with respect to the
                ImageNet dataset.

    # Returns
        Preprocessed Numpy array.
    """
    if mode == 'tf':
        x = x / 127.5 - 1.0
        return x

    if mode == 'torch':
        x = x / 255.0
        mean = [0.485, 0.456, 0.406]
        std = [0.229, 0.224, 0.225]
    else:
        if data_format == 'channels_first':
            # 'RGB'->'BGR'
            if x.ndim == 3:
                x = x[:, ::-1, ...]
            else:
                x = x[:, :, ::-1, ...]
        else:
            # 'RGB'->'BGR'
            x = x[..., ::-1]
        mean = [103.939, 116.779, 123.68]
        std = None

    # Zero-center by mean pixel
    if data_format == 'channels_first':
        x[:, 0, :, :] -= mean[0]
        x[:, 1, :, :] -= mean[1]
        x[:, 2, :, :] -= mean[2]
        if std is not None:
            x[:, 0, :, :] /= std[0]
            x[:, 1, :, :] /= std[1]
            x[:, 2, :, :] /= std[2]
    else:
        x[..., 0] -= mean[0]
        x[..., 1] -= mean[1]
        x[..., 2] -= mean[2]
        if std is not None:
            x[..., 0] /= std[0]
            x[..., 1] /= std[1]
            x[..., 2] /= std[2]

    return x
```

The corrected version of the function fixes the calculation of mean subtraction and normalization when `mode` is set to `'caffe'` or `'torch'` and `data_format` is set to `'channels_first'. This version of the function should now pass the failing test cases and produce the expected output values.
