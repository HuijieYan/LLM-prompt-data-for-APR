### Analysis:
The buggy function `_preprocess_numpy_input` is responsible for pre-processing image batches in different modes (caffe, tf, torch) based on the input parameters `x`, `data_format`, and `mode`. The bug seems to arise from the conditionals that handle different modes, specifically the calculations for mean and std when `mode` is 'tf' or 'torch'.

### Bug Explanation:
1. For the cases where `mode` is 'tf' or 'torch', the function correctly modifies the input `x` according to the specifications. However, the bug appears when setting the `mean` and `std` values. Since there is no return statement in these cases, the function incorrectly sets these values and proceeds to the next conditional blocks, causing confusion and incorrect calculations.
2. The expected behavior is for the function to set `mean` and `std` only when `mode` is 'torch'.

### Bug Fix:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the mean and std values are set only when `mode` is 'torch'. When `mode` is 'tf', the function should apply the appropriate scaling to `x` but skip the mean and std calculations. For other cases, it should correctly handle the conversion based on `data_format`.

### Corrected Function:
```python
def _preprocess_numpy_input(x, data_format, mode):
    """Preprocesses a Numpy array encoding a batch of images.

    # Arguments
        x: Input array, 3D or 4D.
        data_format: Data format of the image array.
        mode: One of "caffe", "tf" or "torch".
            - caffe: will convert the images from RGB to BGR,
                then will zero-center each color channel with
                respect to the ImageNet dataset,
                without scaling.
            - tf: will scale pixels between -1 and 1,
                sample-wise.
            - torch: will scale pixels between 0 and 1 and then
                will normalize each channel with respect to the
                ImageNet dataset.

    # Returns
        Preprocessed Numpy array.

By applying these changes to the `_preprocess_numpy_input` function, the corrected version should now pass the failing test cases provided.
