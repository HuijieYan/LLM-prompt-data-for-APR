### Bug Analysis:
The bug in the `_preprocess_numpy_input` function lies in the section responsible for processing images in 'tf' mode and 'torch' mode. When the input mode is 'tf', the function incorrectly scales the pixel values between -1 and 1 by dividing by 127.5 and subtracting 1. Similarly, when the mode is 'torch', the function incorrectly scales the pixel values between 0 and 1 but does not normalize them based on the ImageNet dataset.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the function correctly preprocesses the input array according to the specified mode ('tf', 'torch'). Specifically, for 'tf' mode, we should scale the pixel values between -1 and 1 by dividing by 127.5 and subtracting 1. For 'torch' mode, we should scale the pixel values between 0 and 1 and then normalize each channel based on the ImageNet dataset mean and std.

### Corrected Function:
```python
import numpy as np

def _preprocess_numpy_input(x, data_format, mode):
    """Preprocesses a Numpy array encoding a batch of images.

    # Arguments
        x: Input array, 3D or 4D.
        data_format: Data format of the image array.
        mode: One of "caffe", "tf" or "torch".
            - caffe: will convert the images from RGB to BGR,
                then will zero-center each color channel with
                respect to the ImageNet dataset,
                without scaling.
            - tf: will scale pixels between -1 and 1,
                sample-wise.
            - torch: will scale pixels between 0 and 1 and then
                will normalize each channel with respect to the
                ImageNet dataset.

    # Returns
        Preprocessed Numpy array.
    """
    if mode == 'tf':
        x /= 127.5
        x -= 1.
        return x

    if mode == 'torch':
        x /= 255.
        mean = [0.485, 0.456, 0.406]
        std = [0.229, 0.224, 0.225]
        if data_format == 'channels_first':
            x[0] -= mean[0]
            x[1] -= mean[1]
            x[2] -= mean[2]
            x[0] /= std[0]
            x[1] /= std[1]
            x[2] /= std[2]
        else:
            x -= mean
            x /= std
        return x

    if data_format == 'channels_first':
        if x.ndim == 3:
            x[0, :, :] -= 103.939
            x[1, :, :] -= 116.779
            x[2, :, :] -= 123.68
        else:
            x[:, 0, :, :] -= 103.939
            x[:, 1, :, :] -= 116.779
            x[:, 2, :, :] -= 123.68
    else:
        x[..., 0] -= 103.939
        x[..., 1] -= 116.779
        x[..., 2] -= 123.68

    return x
```

By applying these corrections, the `_preprocess_numpy_input` function should now correctly preprocess the input array based on the specified mode and satisfy the expected input/output values for all cases.
