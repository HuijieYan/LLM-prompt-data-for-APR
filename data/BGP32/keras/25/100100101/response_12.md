### Bug Analysis:
The bug in the `_preprocess_numpy_input` function lies in the calculation of the pre-processing values based on the `mode` parameter. The calculations in the `if` and `else` branches are not consistent with the given `mode` options ('tf', 'torch', and others).

1. For the cases where `mode` is not 'tf' or 'torch', the function incorrectly changes the color format from 'RGB' to 'BGR' regardless of the input image. This affects the pre-processing calculations, resulting in an incorrect output.

2. For the 'torch' mode, the function calculates the mean and standard deviation values for normalization. Still, the division operation to normalize each channel is incorrectly performed with the standard deviation values even if they are `None`.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to address the following issues:
1. Adjust the pre-processing calculations based on the `mode` parameter.
2. Ensure that the color format conversion is only performed when necessary.
3. Correctly normalize the input `x` array based on the chosen `mode`.

### Corrected Function:
```python
def _preprocess_numpy_input(x, data_format, mode):
    if mode == 'tf':
        x /= 127.5
        x -= 1.
        return x

    if mode == 'torch':
        x /= 255.
        mean = [0.485, 0.456, 0.406]
        std = [0.229, 0.224, 0.225]
        
        x = x[..., ::-1]  # Convert 'RGB' to 'BGR'
    else:
        mean = [103.939, 116.779, 123.68]
        std = None

        if data_format == 'channels_first' and x.ndim == 4:
            x[:, 0] -= mean[0]
            x[:, 1] -= mean[1]
            x[:, 2] -= mean[2]
            if std is not None:
                x[:, 0] /= std[0]
                x[:, 1] /= std[1]
                x[:, 2] /= std[2]
        elif x.ndim == 3:
            x[..., 0] -= mean[0]
            x[..., 1] -= mean[1]
            x[..., 2] -= mean[2]
            if std is not None:
                x[..., 0] /= std[0]
                x[..., 1] /= std[1]
                x[..., 2] /= std[2]

    return x
```

By making these adjustments, the corrected function should now handle the different pre-processing modes correctly and pass the failing test cases with the expected input/output values.
