### Analysis:
The buggy function `_preprocess_numpy_input` is designed to preprocess a batch of images represented by a Numpy array based on a specified mode. The bug seems to be related to the calculations involving the mean and standard deviation values, specifically when the `mode` is 'torch' or any other mode than 'tf'. The issue lies in how the mean and standard deviation values are used to transform the input array. In the code, the mean values are subtracted from the input array, but the standard deviation values are not used correctly in the division process.

### Bug Explanation:
When the `mode` is 'torch' or different from 'tf', the function expects to apply a certain normalization procedure, including dividing by the standard deviation values. However, due to incorrect conditional branching and calculation handling, the standard deviation values are not incorporated correctly, leading to incorrect preprocessing of input images.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that if the mode is not 'tf', the standard deviation values are properly utilized in the normalization step. This involves adjusting the calculation process to include division by the standard deviation values when applicable.

### Corrected Function:
```python
def _preprocess_numpy_input(x, data_format, mode):
    if mode == 'tf':
        x /= 127.5
        x -= 1.
        return x

    if mode == 'torch':
        x /= 255.
        mean = [0.485, 0.456, 0.406]
        std = [0.229, 0.224, 0.225]
    else:
        if data_format == 'channels_first':
            if x.ndim == 3:
                x = x[::-1, ...]
            else:
                x = x[:, ::-1, ...]
        else:
            x = x[..., ::-1]
        mean = [103.939, 116.779, 123.68]
        std = None

    if std is not None:  # Include standard deviation in normalization
        x -= mean
        x /= std
    else:
        x -= mean

    return x
```

### Update:
- Added a conditional statement to check if `std` is not None before including it in the normalization process.
- Adjusted the normalization step to divide by `std` if it is not None, after subtracting the mean values.

By making the changes above, the corrected function should now properly preprocess input batches of images according to the specified mode and data format, including correct handling of mean and standard deviation values.
