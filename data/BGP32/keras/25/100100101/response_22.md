### Analysis:
The buggy function `_preprocess_numpy_input` is not correctly handling the preprocessing based on the `mode` and `data_format` parameters. There are issues with how the function applies the mean subtraction and scaling based on the input mode. The calculations for mean subtraction and scaling are not done correctly, leading to incorrect preprocessed outputs.

### Bug Explanation:
- For the `mode == 'torch'` condition, the function assigns the mean and std values correctly. However, it doesn't apply the mean subtraction and normalization as intended.
- In the case where `mode` is not 'tf' or 'torch', the function handles the 'channels_first' and 'channels_last' data formats differently, but there are discrepancies in the mean subtraction and scaling calculations.
- The calculation for normalizing by the provided mean and std values are not correctly implemented for different data formats.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Update the function to correctly apply the mean subtraction and normalization for the different modes and data formats.
2. Ensure that the mean subtraction and std normalization calculations are consistent with the provided mean and std values for each mode.
3. Make necessary adjustments to handle the different data formats ('channels_first' and 'channels_last') appropriately for the preprocessing.

### Corrected Function:
```python
import numpy as np

def _preprocess_numpy_input(x, data_format, mode):
    if mode == 'tf':
        x /= 127.5
        x -= 1.
        return x

    if mode == 'torch':
        x /= 255.
        mean = np.array([0.485, 0.456, 0.406])
        std = np.array([0.229, 0.224, 0.225])
        x = (x - mean) / std
        return x

    if data_format == 'channels_first':
        if x.ndim == 3:
            if mode != 'tf' and mode != 'torch':
                mean = np.array([103.939, 116.779, 123.68])
                x[0] -= mean[0]
                x[1] -= mean[1]
                x[2] -= mean[2]
                return x
            else:
                raise ValueError("Invalid mode for 'channels_first' data format.")
        else:
            if mode != 'tf' and mode != 'torch':
                mean = np.array([103.939, 116.779, 123.68])
                x[:, 0] -= mean[0]
                x[:, 1] -= mean[1]
                x[:, 2] -= mean[2]
                return x
            else:
                raise ValueError("Invalid mode for 'channels_first' data format.")
    else:
        if x.ndim == 3:
            mean = np.array([103.939, 116.779, 123.68])
            x[..., 0] -= mean[0]
            x[..., 1] -= mean[1]
            x[..., 2] -= mean[2]
            return x
        else:
            mean = np.array([103.939, 116.779, 123.68])
            x[..., 0] -= mean[0]
            x[..., 1] -= mean[1]
            x[..., 2] -= mean[2]
            return x
```

By correcting the calculations for mean subtraction and normalization in the `mode == 'torch'` condition and handling the different data formats correctly, the corrected function should now produce the expected outputs for the given test cases.
