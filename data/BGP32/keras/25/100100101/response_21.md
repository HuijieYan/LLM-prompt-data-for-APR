### Error Analysis:
1. The function `_preprocess_numpy_input` has conditional branches for different `mode` values but lacks handling for the case when `mode` is neither `'tf'` nor `'torch'`.
2. In the `else` block for the case where `mode` is not `'tf'` or `'torch'`, there is a conversion of RGB to BGR based on the `data_format` which could be incorrect.
3. The calculations involving `mean` and `std` values in the function are incorrect for different cases.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is caused when the `mode` is not `'tf'` or `'torch'`, and the RGB to BGR conversion is not done correctly, affecting the normalization step.

### Bug Fix:
To address the bug, we need to:
1. Add handling for the case when `mode` is neither `'tf'` nor `'torch'` by correctly converting RGB to BGR.
2. Update the calculation of mean and std based on the correct values and format.

### Corrected Version:
```python
import numpy as np

def _preprocess_numpy_input(x, data_format, mode):
    if mode == 'tf':
        x /= 127.5
        x -= 1.
        return x

    if mode == 'torch':
        x /= 255.
        mean = [0.485, 0.456, 0.406]
        std = [0.229, 0.224, 0.225]
    else:
        if data_format == 'channels_first':
            x = x[:, ::-1, ...]
        else:
            x = x[..., ::-1]
        mean = [103.939, 116.779, 123.68]
        std = None

    # Zero-center by mean pixel
    x -= mean
    if std is not None:
        x /= std

    return x
```

By updating the function with the corrected version provided above, the function should now handle all cases correctly and pass the failing tests with the expected input/output values.
