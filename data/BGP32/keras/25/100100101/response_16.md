### Analysis:
The buggy function `_preprocess_numpy_input` seems to have an issue with normalizing the input array `x` based on the specified `mode` and `data_format`. The bug is likely in the calculation or application of the mean and standard deviation values for different modes and data formats.

### Bug Cause:
The bug causes incorrect normalization and mean subtraction for the input array `x`, leading to incorrect preprocessed output.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to adjust the calculations of mean and standard deviation based on the specified `mode` and `data_format`. Additionally, the normalization and mean subtraction calculations should be correct for each channel and channel-wise normalization should be performed depending on the data format (`channels_first` or `channels_last`).

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def _preprocess_numpy_input(x, data_format, mode):
    if mode == 'tf':
        x /= 127.5
        x -= 1.
        return x

    if mode == 'torch':
        x /= 255.
        mean = [0.485, 0.456, 0.406]
        std = [0.229, 0.224, 0.225]
    else:
        if data_format == 'channels_first':
            # 'RGB'->'BGR'
            if x.ndim == 3:
                x = x[:, ::-1, ...]
            else:
                x = x[:, :, ::-1, ...]
        else:
            # 'RGB'->'BGR'
            x = x[..., ::-1]
        mean = [103.939, 116.779, 123.68]
        std = None

    # Zero-center by mean pixel
    if data_format == 'channels_first':
        x[:, 0, :, :] -= mean[0]
        x[:, 1, :, :] -= mean[1]
        x[:, 2, :, :] -= mean[2]
        if std is not None:
            x[:, 0, :, :] /= std[0]
            x[:, 1, :, :] /= std[1]
            x[:, 2, :, :] /= std[2]
    else:
        x[..., 0] -= mean[0]
        x[..., 1] -= mean[1]
        x[..., 2] -= mean[2]
        if std is not None:
            x[..., 0] /= std[0]
            x[..., 1] /= std[1]
            x[..., 2] /= std[2]
    return x
```

After applying these changes, the corrected function should now correctly preprocess the input array `x` based on the specified `mode` and `data_format` without any normalization issues.
