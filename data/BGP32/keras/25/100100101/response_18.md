The bug in the `_preprocess_numpy_input` function lies in the calculation and normalization of pixel values based on the chosen mode. The bug causes incorrect transformations of the input pixel values, leading to incorrect preprocessed arrays. 

To fix the bug, we need to update the calculation of pixel values based on the chosen mode correctly. Specifically, we need to ensure that RGB to BGR conversions and mean subtraction are done accurately for different data formats and modes.

Here is the corrected version of the `_preprocess_numpy_input` function:

```python
def _preprocess_numpy_input(x, data_format, mode):
    if mode == 'tf':
        x /= 127.5
        x -= 1.
        return x

    if mode == 'torch':
        x /= 255.
        mean = np.array([0.485, 0.456, 0.406])
        std = np.array([0.229, 0.224, 0.225])
        x = (x - mean) / std
    else:
        if data_format == 'channels_first':
            # 'RGB'->'BGR'
            if x.ndim == 3:
                x = x[:, ::-1, ...]
            else:
                x = x[:, :, ::-1, :]
        else:
            # 'RGB'->'BGR'
            x = x[..., ::-1]
        
        mean = np.array([103.939, 116.779, 123.68])
        x -= mean

    return x
```

By making these changes, the function should now correctly preprocess the input arrays according to the specified mode and data format.

Please ensure to run tests on this corrected function to confirm that it now behaves as expected and passes all the failing test cases provided.
