### Analysis:
The buggy function `_preprocess_numpy_input` is supposed to preprocess a numpy array based on the specified mode ('caffe', 'tf', 'torch') and data format ('channels_first', 'channels_last'). The bug seems to be located in the calculation of the preprocessed array based on the mode provided. In the 'tf' mode, the function correctly scales the pixels, but in the 'torch' mode, the normalization is not properly applied.

### Bug Explanation:
When the mode is set to 'torch', the bug occurs in the calculation of the mean normalization. The mean is applied correctly to the x array, but the standard deviation (std) is not taken into account for the normalization step.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the standard deviation is considered for the normalization in the 'torch' mode. We should apply the same normalization process for both mean and std to scale the pixels between 0 and 1.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def _preprocess_numpy_input(x, data_format, mode):
    """Preprocesses a Numpy array encoding a batch of images.

    # Arguments
        x: Input array, 3D or 4D.
        data_format: Data format of the image array.
        mode: One of "caffe", "tf" or "torch".
            - caffe: will convert the images from RGB to BGR,
                then will zero-center each color channel with
                respect to the ImageNet dataset,
                without scaling.
            - tf: will scale pixels between -1 and 1,
                sample-wise.
            - torch: will scale pixels between 0 and 1 and then
                will normalize each channel with respect to the
                ImageNet dataset.

    # Returns
        Preprocessed Numpy array.
    """
    if mode == 'tf':
        x /= 127.5
        x -= 1.
        return x

    if mode == 'torch':
        x /= 255.
        mean = [0.485, 0.456, 0.406]
        std = [0.229, 0.224, 0.225]
    else:
        if data_format == 'channels_first':
            # 'RGB'->'BGR'
            if x.ndim == 3:
                x = x[::-1, ...]
            else:
                x = x[:, ::-1, ...]
        else:
            # 'RGB'->'BGR'
            x = x[..., ::-1]
        mean = [103.939, 116.779, 123.68]
        std = None

    # Zero-center by mean pixel
    x -= mean
    if std is not None:
        x /= std
    
    return x
```

By including the standard deviation in the normalization step for the 'torch' mode, the corrected function should now pass the failing test cases and produce the expected preprocessed arrays.
