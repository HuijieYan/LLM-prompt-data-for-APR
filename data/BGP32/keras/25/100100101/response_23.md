### Analysis:
1. The function `_preprocess_numpy_input` preprocesses a numpy array of images based on the specified mode ("caffe", "tf", "torch") and data format ("channels_first", "channels_last").
2. The bug seems to be related to incorrect processing of input arrays when the mode is not "tf" or "torch".
3. The failing test case indicates that the output of the function does not match the expected values when the data format is specified as either "channels_first" or "channels_last".
4. The issue appears to be with the calculation and application of mean and standard deviation values based on the data format and mode.
5. To fix the bug, the mean and std calculations should be correctly applied based on the mode and data format.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Check the processing logic for different modes and data formats.
2. Ensure that mean and std calculations are correctly applied based on the mode and data format.
3. Verify that the mean subtraction and division operations are performed correctly for different dimensions.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
import numpy as np

def _preprocess_numpy_input(x, data_format, mode):
    if mode == 'tf':
        x /= 127.5
        x -= 1.
        return x

    if mode == 'torch':
        x /= 255.
        mean = [0.485, 0.456, 0.406]
        std = [0.229, 0.224, 0.225]
    else:
        if data_format == 'channels_first':
          # 'RGB'->'BGR'
            if x.ndim == 3:
                x = x[::-1, ...]
            else:
                x = x[:, ::-1, ...]
        else:
          # 'RGB'->'BGR'
            x = x[..., ::-1]
            
        mean = [103.939, 116.779, 123.68]
        std = None

    # Zero-center by mean pixel
    if data_format == 'channels_first':
        x[:, 0, :, :] -= mean[0]
        x[:, 1, :, :] -= mean[1]
        x[:, 2, :, :] -= mean[2]
        if std is not None:
            x[:, 0, :, :] /= std[0]
            x[:, 1, :, :] /= std[1]
            x[:, 2, :, :] /= std[2]
    else:
        x[..., 0] -= mean[0]
        x[..., 1] -= mean[1]
        x[..., 2] -= mean[2]
        if std is not None:
            x[..., 0] /= std[0]
            x[..., 1] /= std[1]
            x[..., 2] /= std[2]
    
    return x
```

By applying the corrected version of the function, the provided failing test cases should now pass based on the expected input/output values for different scenarios.
