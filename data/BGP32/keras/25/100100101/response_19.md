### Bugs in the provided function:
1. The function does not handle the case when `mode` is neither `'tf'` nor `'torch'`. This results in incorrect preprocessing for the `'caffe'` mode.
2. When `mode` is not `'tf'` or `'torch'`, the function incorrectly calculates `mean` and `std` values based on the `data_format` which may lead to incorrect preprocessing.

### Bug Explanation:
In the provided function `_preprocess_numpy_input`, when `mode` is neither `'tf'` nor `'torch`, the `mean` and `std` values are incorrectly calculated based on the `data_format`. This results in incorrect preprocessing for the `'caffe'` mode and potentially for other undefined modes as well, affecting the output array.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to correctly handle the preprocessing for the `'caffe'` mode by calculating the correct `mean` and `std` values when `mode` is `'caffe'` and the correct `mean` values when `mode` is either `'tf'` or `'torch'.

### Corrected Function:
```python
import numpy as np

def _preprocess_numpy_input(x, data_format, mode):
    """Preprocesses a Numpy array encoding a batch of images.

    # Arguments
        x: Input array, 3D or 4D.
        data_format: Data format of the image array.
        mode: One of "caffe", "tf" or "torch".
            - caffe: will convert the images from RGB to BGR,
                then will zero-center each color channel with
                respect to the ImageNet dataset,
                without scaling.
            - tf: will scale pixels between -1 and 1,
                sample-wise.
            - torch: will scale pixels between 0 and 1 and then
                will normalize each channel with respect to the
                ImageNet dataset.

    # Returns
        Preprocessed Numpy array.
    """
    
    if mode == 'tf':
        x /= 127.5
        x -= 1.
        return x
    
    if mode == 'torch':
        x /= 255.
        mean = [0.485, 0.456, 0.406]
        std = [0.229, 0.224, 0.225]
    
    if mode == 'caffe':
        if data_format == 'channels_first':
            x = x[:, ::-1, ...]
        else:
            x = x[..., ::-1]
        mean = [103.939, 116.779, 123.68]
        std = None
    
    # Zero-center by mean pixel
    if std is not None:
        x -= mean
        x /= std
    else:
        x -= mean
        
    return x
```

By the corrected function above, the bug regarding incorrect preprocessing for the `'caffe'` mode should be fixed. It takes into account the correct mean values for preprocessing in the `'caffe'` mode.
