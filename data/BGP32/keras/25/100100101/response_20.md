### Potential Error Locations:
1. The calculations for mean subtraction and division by standard deviation are not correctly handled for different input shapes and data formats.
2. The handling of different data formats (channels_first, channels_last) may not be consistent or accurate in all cases.
3. The conditional logic for different modes ('caffe', 'tf', 'torch') might not be properly implemented.

### Bug Explanation:
The bug in the `_preprocess_numpy_input` function arises due to incorrect handling of mean subtraction and standard deviation division. In the provided buggy function, the mean subtraction and division by standard deviation are not adjusted based on the input data format accurately. This results in incorrect preprocessing of input arrays, leading to incorrect output values.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to adjust the mean and standard deviation calculations based on the input data format and ensure consistent handling of different modes. We should also properly handle different input shapes and data formats to ensure accurate preprocessing.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def _preprocess_numpy_input(x, data_format, mode):
    """Preprocesses a Numpy array encoding a batch of images.

    # Arguments
        x: Input array, 3D or 4D.
        data_format: Data format of the image array.
        mode: One of "caffe", "tf" or "torch".
            - caffe: will convert the images from RGB to BGR,
                then will zero-center each color channel with
                respect to the ImageNet dataset,
                without scaling.
            - tf: will scale pixels between -1 and 1,
                sample-wise.
            - torch: will scale pixels between 0 and 1 and then
                will normalize each channel with respect to the
                ImageNet dataset.

    # Returns
        Preprocessed Numpy array.
    """
    if mode == 'tf':
        x /= 127.5
        x -= 1.
        return x
    elif mode == 'torch':
        x /= 255.
        mean = np.array([0.485, 0.456, 0.406])
        std = np.array([0.229, 0.224, 0.225])
    else:
        mean = np.array([103.939, 116.779, 123.68])
        std = None

    if data_format == 'channels_first':
        if x.ndim == 3:
            for i in range(3):
                x[i, :, :] -= mean[i]
                if std is not None:
                    x[i, :, :] /= std[i]
        else:
            for i in range(3):
                x[:, i, :, :] -= mean[i]
                if std is not None:
                    x[:, i, :, :] /= std[i]
    else:
        for i in range(3):
            x[..., i] -= mean[i]
            if std is not None:
                x[..., i] /= std[i]

    return x
```

### The corrected function now properly handles mean subtraction and standard deviation division based on input data format and ensures accurate preprocessing of input arrays. This corrected version should pass the failing test cases and provide the expected output values for different input parameters and formats.
