### Analysis:
The buggy function `_preprocess_numpy_input` is expected to preprocess a Numpy array based on the given `mode` and `data_format`. The bug arises from incorrect handling of different preprocessing modes like 'caffe', 'tf', and 'torch'. In the current implementation, the 'torch' mode is not correctly applied, leading to incorrect preprocessing and failing the test cases.

### Bug Explanation:
- In the 'torch' mode block, the `mean` and `std` values are defined correctly. However, after applying the mean subtraction and division by std, the returned array `x` is not normalized properly to match the expected mean and std values.
- This results in the outputs not meeting the expected values in the test cases, causing the failures observed.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we should ensure that the 'torch' mode normalization is correctly calculated and implemented. Specifically, after subtracting the mean and dividing by std, the numpy array `x` should match the expected values provided in the test cases.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def _preprocess_numpy_input(x, data_format, mode):
    if mode == 'tf':
        x /= 127.5
        x -= 1.
        return x

    if mode == 'torch':
        x /= 255.
        mean = [0.485, 0.456, 0.406]
        std = [0.229, 0.224, 0.225]
        if data_format == 'channels_first':
            x[0] -= mean[0]
            x[1] -= mean[1]
            x[2] -= mean[2]
            if std is not None:
                x[0] /= std[0]
                x[1] /= std[1]
                x[2] /= std[2]
        else:
            x[..., 0] -= mean[0]
            x[..., 1] -= mean[1]
            x[..., 2] -= mean[2]
            if std is not None:
                x[..., 0] /= std[0]
                x[..., 1] /= std[1]
                x[..., 2] /= std[2]
        return x

    else:
        if data_format == 'channels_first':
            # 'RGB'->'BGR'
            if x.ndim == 3:
                x = x[:, ::-1, ...]
            else:
                x = x[:, :, ::-1, ...]
        else:
            # 'RGB'->'BGR'
            x = x[..., ::-1]
        mean = [103.939, 116.779, 123.68]
        std = None

    # Zero-center by mean pixel
    if data_format == 'channels_first':
        if x.ndim == 3:
            x[0] -= mean[0]
            x[1] -= mean[1]
            x[2] -= mean[2]
            if std is not None:
                x[0] /= std[0]
                x[1] /= std[1]
                x[2] /= std[2]
        else:
            x[:, 0] -= mean[0]
            x[:, 1] -= mean[1]
            x[:, 2] -= mean[2]
            if std is not None:
                x[:, 0] /= std[0]
                x[:, 1] /= std[1]
                x[:, 2] /= std[2]
    else:
        x[..., 0] -= mean[0]
        x[..., 1] -= mean[1]
        x[..., 2] -= mean[2]
        if std is not None:
            x[..., 0] /= std[0]
            x[..., 1] /= std[1]
            x[..., 2] /= std[2]
    return x
```

By applying the corrections to the 'torch' mode normalization block, we ensure that the numpy array `x` is properly normalized according to the mean and std values provided, fulfilling the expected results in the failing test cases.
