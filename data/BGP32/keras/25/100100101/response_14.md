### Analysis:
The buggy function `_preprocess_numpy_input` is designed to preprocess input image data according to different modes ("caffe", "tf", "torch") and data formats ("channels_first" or "channels_last"). The bug seems to be related to the incorrect implementation of either the "caffe" mode or the data format handling.

In the failing test cases, we expect the input images (`x`) to be preprocessed according to the "caffe" mode and the specified data format. The expected output values are calculated based on the provided mean and standard deviation values.

### Error Location:
The bug likely occurs in the calculation and application of the mean and standard deviation values when the mode is set to "torch" or when handling the "caffe" mode with different data formats.

### Bug Explanation:
For the failing test cases, the bug likely manifests as an incorrect transformation of the input image data, resulting in incorrect mean subtraction and possibly wrong channel-wise normalization. This leads to the mismatch between the expected and actual output values.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
1. Check and correct the mean subtraction and channel-wise normalization calculations for both "torch" mode and the "caffe" mode with different data formats.
2. Ensure that the images are properly converted between RGB and BGR according to the data format.
3. Verify the correct application of mean subtraction and normalization for different channel positions based on the data format.

### Updated Corrected Function: `_preprocess_numpy_input`:
```python
def _preprocess_numpy_input(x, data_format, mode):
    if mode == 'tf':
        x /= 127.5
        x -= 1.
        return x

    if mode == 'torch':
        x /= 255.
        mean = [0.485, 0.456, 0.406]
        std = [0.229, 0.224, 0.225]
    else:
        if data_format == 'channels_first':
            # 'RGB'->'BGR'
            if x.ndim == 3:
                x = x[:, ::-1, ...]
            else:
                x = x[:, :, ::-1, ...]
        else:
            # 'RGB'->'BGR'
            x = x[..., ::-1]
        mean = [103.939, 116.779, 123.68]
        std = None

    # Zero-center by mean pixel
    if data_format == 'channels_first':
        x[:, 0, :, :] -= mean[0]
        x[:, 1, :, :] -= mean[1]
        x[:, 2, :, :] -= mean[2]
        if std is not None:
            x[:, 0, :, :] /= std[0]
            x[:, 1, :, :] /= std[1]
            x[:, 2, :, :] /= std[2]
    else:
        x[..., 0] -= mean[0]
        x[..., 1] -= mean[1]
        x[..., 2] -= mean[2]
        if std is not None:
            x[..., 0] /= std[0]
            x[..., 1] /= std[1]
            x[..., 2] /= std[2]
    
    return x
```

By updating the function as suggested above, it should now correctly preprocess the input image data according to the specified mode and data format, successfully passing the failing test cases and providing the expected output values.
