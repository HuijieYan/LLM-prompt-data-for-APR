### Bug Explanation:
The bug in the `_preprocess_numpy_input` function lies in the calculation of the preprocessed array based on the `mode` parameter. The bug occurs when `mode` is neither `'tf'` nor `'torch'`. In this case, the function incorrectly performs RGB to BGR conversion for the input array `x` and then proceeds to subtract mean pixel values from it, without handling the necessary data format conversions accurately based on the `data_format` parameter.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Check the `mode` parameter first and handle the `'tf'` and `'torch'` cases separately as they are already correctly implemented.
2. For the default case when `mode` is not `'tf'` or `'torch'`, ensure that RGB to BGR conversion and mean subtraction are performed correctly based on the `data_format` parameter.

### Corrected Function:
```python
import numpy as np

def _preprocess_numpy_input(x, data_format, mode):
    """Preprocesses a Numpy array encoding a batch of images.

    # Arguments
        x: Input array, 3D or 4D.
        data_format: Data format of the image array.
        mode: One of "caffe", "tf" or "torch".
            - caffe: will convert the images from RGB to BGR,
                then will zero-center each color channel with
                respect to the ImageNet dataset,
                without scaling.
            - tf: will scale pixels between -1 and 1,
                sample-wise.
            - torch: will scale pixels between 0 and 1 and then
                will normalize each channel with respect to the
                ImageNet dataset.

    # Returns
        Preprocessed Numpy array.
    """
    if mode == 'tf':
        x /= 127.5
        x -= 1.
        return x

    if mode == 'torch':
        x /= 255.
        mean = [0.485, 0.456, 0.406]
        std = [0.229, 0.224, 0.225]
    else:
        # Perform RGB to BGR conversion and mean subtraction based on data_format
        if data_format == 'channels_first':
            if x.ndim == 3:
                x = x[:, ::-1, ...]  # 'RGB' -> 'BGR'
            else:
                x = x[:, :, ::-1, ...]  # 'RGB' -> 'BGR'
        else:
            x = x[..., ::-1]  # 'RGB' -> 'BGR'
        mean = [103.939, 116.779, 123.68]
        std = None

    # Normalize by mean and std deviation
    x = np.subtract(x, mean)
    if std is not None:
        x = np.divide(x, std)
        
    return x
```

Now, the corrected function should handle the default case accurately and pass the failing test cases while providing the expected output values.
