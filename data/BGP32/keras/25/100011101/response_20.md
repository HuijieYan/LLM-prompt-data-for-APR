### Bug Explanation
The bug occurs when the function receives an input array `x` with integer values and the `mode` is set to `'caffe'`. The bug arises from performing arithmetic operations on integer arrays (subtract) when the operation involves a float value. This leads to a casting error because NumPy doesn't allow operations that mix integer and float types like subtracting a float from an integer array.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the input array `x` is cast to a float array before performing the arithmetic operations. This way, we prevent any type conflicts that may result in casting errors.

### Corrected Function
I will modify the `_preprocess_numpy_input` function to cast the array `x` to a float type before performing any arithmetic operations. Here is the corrected version:

```python
def _preprocess_numpy_input(x, data_format, mode):
    if mode == 'tf':
        x = x.astype('float32')  # Cast x to float
        x /= 127.5
        x -= 1.
        return x

    if mode == 'torch':
        x = x.astype('float32')  # Cast x to float
        x /= 255.
        mean = [0.485, 0.456, 0.406]
        std = [0.229, 0.224, 0.225]
    else:
        x = x.astype('float32')  # Cast x to float
        if data_format == 'channels_first':
            # 'RGB'->'BGR'
            if x.ndim == 3:
                x = x[::-1, ...]
            else:
                x = x[:, ::-1, ...]
        else:
            # 'RGB'->'BGR'
            x = x[..., ::-1]
        mean = [103.939, 116.779, 123.68]
        std = None

    # Zero-center by mean pixel
    if data_format == 'channels_first':
        if x.ndim == 3:
            x[0, :, :] -= mean[0]
            x[1, :, :] -= mean[1]
            x[2, :, :] -= mean[2]
            if std is not None:
                x[0, :, :] /= std[0]
                x[1, :, :] /= std[1]
                x[2, :, :] /= std[2]
        else:
            x[:, 0, :, :] -= mean[0]
            x[:, 1, :, :] -= mean[1]
            x[:, 2, :, :] -= mean[2]
            if std is not None:
                x[:, 0, :, :] /= std[0]
                x[:, 1, :, :] /= std[1]
                x[:, 2, :, :] /= std[2]
    else:
        x[..., 0] -= mean[0]
        x[..., 1] -= mean[1]
        x[..., 2] -= mean[2]
        if std is not None:
            x[..., 0] /= std[0]
            x[..., 1] /= std[1]
            x[..., 2] /= std[2]
    return x
```

This corrected function will ensure that input arrays are treated as float arrays and prevent casting errors during arithmetic operations.
