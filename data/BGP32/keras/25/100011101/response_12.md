### Analysis
- The bug occurs when the input `x` is an integer array, causing a data type mismatch during the subtraction operation with `mean`, which contains float values.
- The error message indicates that there is a `UFuncTypeError`, meaning a type casting issue during the subtraction operation.

### Bug Fix Strategy
- The bug fix involves ensuring that the data types of `x` and `mean` are compatible during the subtraction operation.

### Bug Fix
```python
import numpy as np

def _preprocess_numpy_input(x, data_format, mode):
    """Preprocesses a Numpy array encoding a batch of images.

    # Arguments
        x: Input array, 3D or 4D.
        data_format: Data format of the image array.
        mode: One of "caffe", "tf" or "torch".
            - caffe: will convert the images from RGB to BGR,
                then will zero-center each color channel with
                respect to the ImageNet dataset,
                without scaling.
            - tf: will scale pixels between -1 and 1,
                sample-wise.
            - torch: will scale pixels between 0 and 1 and then
                will normalize each channel with respect to the
                ImageNet dataset.

    # Returns
        Preprocessed Numpy array.
    """
    x = np.asarray(x, dtype=np.float32)  # Convert x to float array
    if mode == 'tf':
        x /= 127.5
        x -= 1.
        return x

    if mode == 'torch':
        x /= 255.
        mean = np.array([0.485, 0.456, 0.406])
        std = np.array([0.229, 0.224, 0.225])
    else:
        if data_format == 'channels_first':
            # 'RGB'->'BGR'
            if x.ndim == 3:
                x = x[:, ::-1, ...]
            else:
                x = x[:, :, ::-1, ...]
        else:
            # 'RGB'->'BGR'
            x = x[..., ::-1]
        mean = np.array([103.939, 116.779, 123.68])
        std = None

    # Zero-center by mean pixel
    x -= mean.reshape((1, 1, 1, 3))
    if std is not None:
        x /= std.reshape((1, 1, 1, 3))

    return x
``` 

### Updates Made
1. Added `np.asarray(x, dtype=np.float32)` to convert `x` to a float array.
2. Changed the initialization of `mean` to use `np.array` for consistency.
3. Reshaped `mean` and `std` before subtraction to broadcast correctly based on the input `x`.
4. Fixed the channel order reversal based on the data format.

Now, the function should handle integer input arrays correctly and perform the necessary preprocessing steps.
