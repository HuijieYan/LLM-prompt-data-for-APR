### Bug Analysis:
The bug occurs when the code tries to subtract the mean values from the input array `x`. The error message indicates that there is a type mismatch when attempting to subtract the mean from the array of type `int32`. This discrepancy arises from the fact that the mean values are floats, and the operation involving float and integer arrays results in the casting error.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix this bug, we need to ensure that all operations are performed consistently with the data types. Specifically, when subtracting the mean values from the input array, the mean values should also be converted to the same data type as the input array. This way, the subtraction operation can be executed without any type casting errors.

### Updated and Corrected Function:
```python
def _preprocess_numpy_input(x, data_format, mode):
    if mode == 'tf':
        x = x / 127.5
        x = x - 1.0
        return x.astype('float32')

    mean = [103.939, 116.779, 123.68]
    if mode == 'torch':
        x = x / 255.0
        std = [0.229, 0.224, 0.225]
    else:
        if data_format == 'channels_first':
            x = x[:, ::-1, ...] if x.ndim == 3 else x[:, :, ::-1, ...]
        else:
            x = x[..., ::-1]
        std = None

    mean = np.array(mean, dtype=x.dtype)  # Convert mean to the same data type as x

    if std is not None:
        std = np.array(std, dtype=x.dtype)  # Convert std to the same data type as x

    x -= mean
    if std is not None:
        x /= std

    return x
```

### The corrected function will handle the data type conversion correctly and ensure that the mean values are subtracted from the input array with the same data type, resolving the casting error. This updated version should pass the failing test cases and produce the expected outputs.
