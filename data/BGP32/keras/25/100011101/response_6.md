### Bug Explanation:
In the `_preprocess_numpy_input` function, there is an issue with the calculation of the normalized values when `mode` is `'torch'`. The function attempts to normalize the input array `x` with respect to the ImageNet dataset, but when `data_format` is `'channels_first'`, the normalization is incorrect due to incorrect indexing.

The bug arises from improper indexing and normalization calculations when handling the `data_format` and `mode` conditions for `'torch'`. In cases where `data_format` is `'channels_first'`, the function fails to normalize the input correctly and results in an error due to a mismatch in datatype for subtraction operations.

### Bug Fix:
To fix the bug, we need to correctly normalize the input array `x` based on the provided `mean` and `std` values when `mode` is `'torch'`. Ensure that the indexing is appropriate for the `data_format` being used to correctly normalize the channels.

Here is the corrected version of the `_preprocess_numpy_input` function:

```python
def _preprocess_numpy_input(x, data_format, mode):
    if mode == 'tf':
        x /= 127.5
        x -= 1.
        return x

    if mode == 'torch':
        x /= 255.
        mean = [0.485, 0.456, 0.406]
        std = [0.229, 0.224, 0.225]
        if data_format == 'channels_first':
            x[0] -= mean[0]
            x[1] -= mean[1]
            x[2] -= mean[2]
            if std is not None:
                x[0] /= std[0]
                x[1] /= std[1]
                x[2] /= std[2]
        else:
            x[..., 0] -= mean[0]
            x[..., 1] -= mean[1]
            x[..., 2] -= mean[2]
            if std is not None:
                x[..., 0] /= std[0]
                x[..., 1] /= std[1]
                x[..., 2] /= std[2]
        return x
    
    if data_format == 'channels_first':
        if x.ndim == 3:
            x = x[:, ::-1, ...]
        else:
            x = x[:, ::-1, :, :]
    else:
        x = x[..., ::-1]

    mean = [103.939, 116.779, 123.68]
    x[..., 0] -= mean[0]
    x[..., 1] -= mean[1]
    x[..., 2] -= mean[2]

    return x
```

This corrected version of the function resolves the indexing and normalization issues for the given scenarios, ensuring the correct preprocessing of the input array based on the specified `mode` and `data_format`.
