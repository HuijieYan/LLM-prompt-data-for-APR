## Bug Explanation:
The bug occurs when the function tries to perform arithmetic operations on the input numpy arrays without converting them to float arrays. This leads to errors as the input data might be in int32 format, causing unexpected behavior in the calculations. The error message `UFuncTypeError: Cannot cast ufunc 'subtract' output from dtype('float64') to dtype('int32') with casting rule 'same_kind'` indicates the mismatch in the data types.

## Bug Fix:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the input arrays `x` are converted to float arrays to allow the arithmetic operations to be performed without issues. This can be done by explicitly converting the input arrays to float arrays at the beginning of the `_preprocess_numpy_input` function.

## Corrected Function:

```python
def _preprocess_numpy_input(x, data_format, mode):
    """Preprocesses a Numpy array encoding a batch of images.

    # Arguments
        x: Input array, 3D or 4D.
        data_format: Data format of the image array.
        mode: One of "caffe", "tf" or "torch".
            - caffe: will convert the images from RGB to BGR,
                then will zero-center each color channel with
                respect to the ImageNet dataset,
                without scaling.
            - tf: will scale pixels between -1 and 1,
                sample-wise.
            - torch: will scale pixels between 0 and 1 and then
                will normalize each channel with respect to the
                ImageNet dataset.
