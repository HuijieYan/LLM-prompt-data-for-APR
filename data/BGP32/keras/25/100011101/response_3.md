### Bug Analysis:
The bug occurs when the `mode` is set to `'torch'`, and the input array `x` has `dtype` set to `int32`, which leads to a `UFuncTypeError` during an arithmetic operation where a float output is attempted to be cast as an `int32` type. This error arises specifically when trying to subtract the `mean` value from the input array `x`.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the input array `x` is converted to a float type before performing arithmetic operations. This conversion will prevent the `UFuncTypeError` from happening when attempting to subtract float values from integers.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def _preprocess_numpy_input(x, data_format, mode):
    """Preprocesses a Numpy array encoding a batch of images.

    # Arguments
        x: Input array, 3D or 4D.
        data_format: Data format of the image array.
        mode: One of "caffe", "tf" or "torch".
            - caffe: convert images from RGB to BGR, zero-center each color channel with respect to ImageNet dataset, without scaling.
            - tf: scale pixels between -1 and 1 sample-wise.
            - torch: scale pixels between 0 and 1, then normalize each channel with respect to ImageNet dataset.

    # Returns
        Preprocessed Numpy array.
    """
    x = x.astype('float32')

    if mode == 'tf':
        x /= 127.5
        x -= 1.
        return x

    if mode == 'torch':
        x /= 255.
        mean = [0.485, 0.456, 0.406]
        std = [0.229, 0.224, 0.225]
    else:
        if data_format == 'channels_first':
            if x.ndim == 3:
                x = x[::-1, ...]
            else:
                x = x[:, ::-1, ...]
        else:
            x = x[..., ::-1]
        mean = [103.939, 116.779, 123.68]
        std = None

    if data_format == 'channels_first':
        if x.ndim == 3:
            x[0, :, :] -= mean[0]
            x[1, :, :] -= mean[1]
            x[2, :, :] -= mean[2]
            if std is not None:
                x[0, :, :] /= std[0]
                x[1, :, :] /= std[1]
                x[2, :, :] /= std[2]
        else:
            x[:, 0, :, :] -= mean[0]
            x[:, 1, :, :] -= mean[1]
            x[:, 2, :, :] -= mean[2]
            if std is not None:
                x[:, 0, :, :] /= std[0]
                x[:, 1, :, :] /= std[1]
                x[:, 2, :, :] /= std[2]
    else:
        x[..., 0] -= mean[0]
        x[..., 1] -= mean[1]
        x[..., 2] -= mean[2]
        if std is not None:
            x[..., 0] /= std[0]
            x[..., 1] /= std[1]
            x[..., 2] /= std[2]
    return x
``` 

By explicitly converting `x` to `float32` at the beginning of the function, we ensure that all arithmetic operations are performed with floating-point values, avoiding the `UFuncTypeError` caused by mixing float and integer types.
