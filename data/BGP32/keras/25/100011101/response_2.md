### Analysis
The bug occurs when trying to subtract the `mean` values from the input array `x` which is of type `int32`. This causes a `UFuncTypeError` because the subtraction operation involves casting from `float64` to `int32`.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the input array `x` is of type `float32` before performing the subtraction operation with the mean values.

### The Corrected Function
```python
import numpy as np

def _preprocess_numpy_input(x, data_format, mode):
    """Preprocesses a Numpy array encoding a batch of images.

    # Arguments
        x: Input array, 3D or 4D.
        data_format: Data format of the image array.
        mode: One of "caffe", "tf" or "torch".
            - caffe: will convert the images from RGB to BGR,
                then will zero-center each color channel with
                respect to the ImageNet dataset,
                without scaling.
            - tf: will scale pixels between -1 and 1,
                sample-wise.
            - torch: will scale pixels between 0 and 1 and then
                will normalize each channel with respect to the
                ImageNet dataset.

    # Returns
        Preprocessed Numpy array.
    """
    x = np.array(x, dtype=np.float32)  # Convert x to float32 type
    if mode == 'tf':
        x /= 127.5
        x -= 1.
        return x

    if mode == 'torch':
        x /= 255.

            x[1, :, :] -= mean[1]
            x[2, :, :] -= mean[2]
            if std is not None:
                x[0, :, :] /= std[0]
                x[1, :, :] /= std[1]
                x[2, :, :] /= std[2]

                x[:, 2, :, :] /= std[2]
    else:
        x[..., 0] -= mean[0]

This corrected version includes the conversion of the input array `x` to `float32` at the beginning of the function to ensure that subsequent operations like subtraction with the `mean` values are performed correctly without causing casting issues.
