### Issue:
The bug in the `_preprocess_numpy_input` function arises when the input `x` is of integer type, causing type conversion errors during arithmetic operations.

### Explanation:
When the input `x` is cast to `int32`, the subsequent operations in the function involve division or subtraction by float values. This leads to a type mismatch error when numpy tries to subtract `mean[0]` from `x[..., 0]`, which is of integer type. 

### Solution:
To fix this bug, we need to ensure that all calculations in the function are performed with floating-point numbers to avoid type conversion issues.

### Corrected Function:
```python
def _preprocess_numpy_input(x, data_format, mode):
    """Preprocesses a Numpy array encoding a batch of images.

    # Arguments
        x: Input array, 3D or 4D.
        data_format: Data format of the image array.
        mode: One of "caffe", "tf" or "torch".
            - caffe: will convert the images from RGB to BGR,
                then will zero-center each color channel with
                respect to the ImageNet dataset,
                without scaling.
            - tf: will scale pixels between -1 and 1,
                sample-wise.
            - torch: will scale pixels between 0 and 1 and then
                will normalize each channel with respect to the
                ImageNet dataset.

    # Returns
        Preprocessed Numpy array.
    """
    x = x.astype('float32')  # Ensure x is a float array
    
    if mode == 'tf':
        x /= 127.5
        x -= 1.0
        return x

    if mode == 'torch':
        x /= 255.0
        mean = [0.485, 0.456, 0.406]
        std = [0.229, 0.224, 0.225]
    else:
        if data_format == 'channels_first':
            # 'RGB' -> 'BGR'
            x = x[:,::-1,...]
        else:
            # 'RGB' -> 'BGR'
            x = x[...,::-1]
        mean = [103.939, 116.779, 123.68]
        std = None

    # Zero-center by mean pixel
    x -= mean
    if std is not None:
        x /= std

    return x
```

By updating the function to ensure that `x` is treated as a float type array and performing all calculations with floating-point numbers, the bug causing the type mismatch error is resolved. This corrected version of the function will now handle integer input arrays (`int32`) correctly and pass the failing test cases.
