The bug in the `_preprocess_numpy_input` function arises from the calculations of mean and std values with different data types which lead to inconsistent type handling during normalization. The error message indicates a type mismatch in the subtract operation between a float (mean values) and an integer (input array).

To address this issue and ensure consistency in data types, we need to ensure that all values are handled as floats during the preprocessing steps.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _preprocess_numpy_input(x, data_format, mode):
    if mode == 'tf':
        x = x / 127.5
        x = x - 1.0
        return x.astype('float32')

    if mode == 'torch':
        x = x / 255.0
        mean = [0.485, 0.456, 0.406]
        std = [0.229, 0.224, 0.225]
    else:
        if data_format == 'channels_first':
            if x.ndim == 3:
                x = x[:, ::-1, ...]
                x = x.astype('float32') - np.array([103.939, 116.779, 123.68]).reshape((1, 3, 1, 1))
            else:
                x = x[:, :, ::-1, ...]
                x = x.astype('float32') - np.array([103.939, 116.779, 123.68])
        else:
            x = x[..., ::-1]
            x = x.astype('float32') - np.array([103.939, 116.779, 123.68])

    return x.astype('float32')
```

In the correction, we placed explicit type casting to float32 to ensure uniformity in data types throughout the operations. This adjustment resolves the type mismatch issue and ensures that all calculations and transformations are consistently applied to float values.

With these changes, the function should now correctly preprocess the input arrays, ensuring that the tests pass and the expected input/output values are satisfied.
