### Bug Explanation:
The bug occurs in the function `_preprocess_numpy_input` when the data_format is 'channels_last' and mode is 'caffe' or 'torch' due to the calculations being performed on the input array `x`, which may lead to incorrect data type conversion as demonstrated in the failing test. The error message "Cannot cast ufunc 'subtract' output from dtype('float64') to dtype('int32') with casting rule 'same_kind'" indicates the issue with data type mismatch during subtraction operations.

The problematic line causing the bug is:
```python
x[..., 0] -= mean[0]
```
Here, since x is a numpy array with dtype int32, trying to perform subtraction on its slice with float64 values from mean leads to type conversion issues, hence causing the bug.

### Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the operations inside the function maintain the correct data type consistency. We should convert the input array `x` to float before performing any division or subtraction operations to avoid type conflicts. Additionally, we need to consider the data format and mode conditions appropriately to ensure the correct preprocessing steps are applied.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def _preprocess_numpy_input(x, data_format, mode):
    x = x.astype('float32')  # Convert x to float32 to ensure consistent data type
    
    if mode == 'tf':
        x /= 127.5
        x -= 1.
        return x

    if mode == 'torch':
        x /= 255.
        mean = [0.485, 0.456, 0.406]
        std = [0.229, 0.224, 0.225]
    else:
        if data_format == 'channels_first':
            # 'RGB'->'BGR'
            if x.ndim == 3:
                x = x[::-1, ...]
            else:
                x = x[:, ::-1, ...]
        else:
            # 'RGB'->'BGR'
            x = x[..., ::-1]
        mean = [103.939, 116.779, 123.68]
        std = None

    # Zero-center by mean pixel
    if data_format == 'channels_first':
        if x.ndim == 3:
            x[0, :, :] -= mean[0]
            x[1, :, :] -= mean[1]
            x[2, :, :] -= mean[2]
            if std is not None:
                x[0, :, :] /= std[0]
                x[1, :, :] /= std[1]
                x[2, :, :] /= std[2]
        else:
            x[:, 0, :, :] -= mean[0]
            x[:, 1, :, :] -= mean[1]
            x[:, 2, :, :] -= mean[2]
            if std is not None:
                x[:, 0, :, :] /= std[0]
                x[:, 1, :, :] /= std[1]
                x[:, 2, :, :] /= std[2]
    else:
        x[..., 0] -= mean[0]
        x[..., 1] -= mean[1]
        x[..., 2] -= mean[2]
        if std is not None:
            x[..., 0] /= std[0]
            x[..., 1] /= std[1]
            x[..., 2] /= std[2]
    return x
``` 

By converting the input array `x` to float32 at the beginning of the function, we can ensure that all subsequent calculations maintain data type consistency. This corrected version should pass the failing test cases and provide the expected output.
