### Bug Explanation
The bug occurs when the `mode` is `'torch'`. In this case, the code attempts to subtract `mean` values that are floats from the input `x`, which is an integer array, causing a type mismatch error since the result is expected to be a float after subtraction. 

### Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that all arithmetic operations that involve `mean` and `std` are performed on float arrays. This can be achieved by converting the input `x` to float before performing these operations, regardless of its initial type.

### Corrected Function
```python
def _preprocess_numpy_input(x, data_format, mode):
    """Preprocesses a Numpy array encoding a batch of images.

    # Arguments
        x: Input array, 3D or 4D.
        data_format: Data format of the image array.
        mode: One of "caffe", "tf" or "torch".
            - caffe: will convert the images from RGB to BGR,
                then will zero-center each color channel with
                respect to the ImageNet dataset,
                without scaling.
            - tf: will scale pixels between -1 and 1,
                sample-wise.
            - torch: will scale pixels between 0 and 1 and then
                will normalize each channel with respect to the
                ImageNet dataset.

    # Returns
        Preprocessed Numpy array.
    """
    x = x.astype('float32')  # Convert input to float

    if mode == 'tf':
        x /= 127.5
        x -= 1.
        return x

    if mode == 'torch':
        x /= 255.
        mean = [0.485, 0.456, 0.406]
        std = [0.229, 0.224, 0.225]
    else:
        if data_format == 'channels_first':
            # 'RGB'->'BGR'
            if x.ndim == 3:
                x = x[::-1, ...]
            else:
                x = x[:, ::-1, ...]
        else:
            # 'RGB'->'BGR'
            x = x[..., ::-1]
            mean = [103.939, 116.779, 123.68]
            std = None

    if mode == 'torch':
        # Normalize each channel with respect to ImageNet dataset
        x -= np.array(mean)
        if std is not None:
            x /= np.array(std)

    return x
``` 

This corrected function should now successfully preprocess the input arrays and avoid the type mismatch error seen previously.
