### Explanation:
The error message indicates that there is an issue with casting the output of the `subtract` operation from dtype `float64` to dtype `int32`. This occurs when trying to subtract a float value from an integer value in the `x[..., 0] -= mean[0]` operation.

### Bug:
The bug is in the way the preprocessing is applied to the input array `x`. When the `mode` is not `'tf'` or `'torch'`, and the `data_format` is not `'channels_first'`, the mean subtraction is being calculated based on float values `[103.939, 116.779, 123.68]`, which leads to a mixed type operation issue.

### Fix:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that both `x` and `mean` have consistent datatypes for subtraction. We can achieve this by converting `mean` to the same datatype as `x` before performing the subtraction operation.

### Corrected Function:
```python
def _preprocess_numpy_input(x, data_format, mode):
    if mode == 'tf':
        x /= 127.5
        x -= 1.
        return x

    if mode == 'torch':
        x /= 255.
        mean = [0.485, 0.456, 0.406]
        std = [0.229, 0.224, 0.225]
    else:
        if data_format == 'channels_first':
            # 'RGB'->'BGR'
            if x.ndim == 3:
                x = x[::-1, ...]
            else:
                x = x[:, ::-1, ...]
        else:
            # 'RGB'->'BGR'
            x = x[..., ::-1]
        mean = np.array([103.939, 116.779, 123.68], dtype=x.dtype)
        std = None

    # Zero-center by mean pixel
    if data_format == 'channels_first':
        if x.ndim == 3:
            x[0, :, :] -= mean[0]
            x[1, :, :] -= mean[1]
            x[2, :, :] -= mean[2]
            if std is not None:
                x[0, :, :] /= std[0]
                x[1, :, :] /= std[1]
                x[2, :, :] /= std[2]
        else:
            x[:, 0, :, :] -= mean[0]
            x[:, 1, :, :] -= mean[1]
            x[:, 2, :, :] -= mean[2]
            if std is not None:
                x[:, 0, :, :] /= std[0]
                x[:, 1, :, :] /= std[1]
                x[:, 2, :, :] /= std[2]
    else:
        x[..., 0] -= mean[0]
        x[..., 1] -= mean[1]
        x[..., 2] -= mean[2]
        if std is not None:
            x[..., 0] /= std[0]
            x[..., 1] /= std[1]
            x[..., 2] /= std[2]
    return x
```

By ensuring that the `mean` values are converted to the same datatype as `x`, we fix the bug that caused the mixed type operation issue in the subtraction process.
