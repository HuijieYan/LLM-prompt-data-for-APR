### Bug Analysis:
The error message indicates a `UFuncTypeError` which occurs when there is an issue with casting the output of a numpy ufunc operation. Specifically, the error arises from trying to subtract a float value from an integer numpy array. This mismatch in types causes the error.

### Bug Explanation:
In the function `_preprocess_numpy_input`, when the `mode` is not 'tf' or 'torch', the processing involves subtracting mean values from the input numpy array `x`, which is expected to be a float array. However, in the failing test case, the input array `xint` is of type `int32`, leading to the mismatch between the types during subtraction and the subsequent error.

### Bug Fix:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the input array `x` is of float type before executing the subtraction operations. We can achieve this by converting the input integer array to float before the subtraction.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
# The corrected version of the buggy function
def _preprocess_numpy_input(x, data_format, mode):
    """Preprocesses a Numpy array encoding a batch of images.

    # Arguments
        x: Input array, 3D or 4D.
        data_format: Data format of the image array.
        mode: One of "caffe", "tf" or "torch".
            - caffe: will convert the images from RGB to BGR,
                then will zero-center each color channel with
                respect to the ImageNet dataset,
                without scaling.
            - tf: will scale pixels between -1 and 1,
                sample-wise.
            - torch: will scale pixels between 0 and 1 and then
                will normalize each channel with respect to the
                ImageNet dataset.

    # Returns
        Preprocessed Numpy array.

By ensuring that `x` is of float type before performing the subtraction operations, we fix the bug and allow the function to handle both float and int input arrays correctly.
