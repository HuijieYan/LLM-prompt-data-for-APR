### Bug Explanation:
The bug occurs when the function tries to subtract the mean value from pixel values of the input array `x` with integer data type. Subtracting a floating point value from an integer array raises a `UFuncTypeError` because it cannot cast the output to the integer data type.

### Bug Fix:
To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the input array `x` is converted to a floating point type before performing the mean subtraction operation. This can be done by explicitly converting `x` to a floating point type before subtracting the mean values.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def _preprocess_numpy_input(x, data_format, mode):
    """Preprocesses a Numpy array encoding a batch of images.

    # Arguments
        x: Input array, 3D or 4D.
        data_format: Data format of the image array.
        mode: One of "caffe", "tf" or "torch".
            - caffe: will convert the images from RGB to BGR,
                then will zero-center each color channel with
                respect to the ImageNet dataset,
                without scaling.
            - tf: will scale pixels between -1 and 1,
                sample-wise.
            - torch: will scale pixels between 0 and 1 and then
                will normalize each channel with respect to the
                ImageNet dataset.

    # Returns
        Preprocessed Numpy array.

By converting `x` to a floating-point type at the beginning of the `_preprocess_numpy_input` function, we ensure that subsequent mathematical operations involving mean subtraction work correctly. This correction will resolve the `UFuncTypeError` seen in the failing test scenario.
