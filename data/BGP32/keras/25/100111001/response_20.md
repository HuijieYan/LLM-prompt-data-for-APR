### Bug Explanation
The error occurs due to the mismatch in data types. The input `xint` is of type `int32`, but the calculation in the function leads to a `float64` type. Specifically, the subtraction operation `x[..., 0] -= mean[0]` results in a float value while trying to assign back to an `int32` array causing the error.

### Bug Fix
To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the type of `x` matches the data type of `mean` to prevent casting issues during operations. One way to achieve this is by explicitly converting `x` to the same data type as `mean` before applying operations. 

### Corrected Version
```python
def _preprocess_numpy_input(x, data_format, mode):
    if mode == 'tf':
        x /= 127.5
        x -= 1.
        return x

    if mode == 'torch':
        x = x.astype('float32')  # Ensure x is of the same type as mean and std
        x /= 255.
        mean = [0.485, 0.456, 0.406]
        std = [0.229, 0.224, 0.225]
    else:
        x = x.astype('float32')  # Ensure x is of the same type as mean and std
        if data_format == 'channels_first':
            # 'RGB'->'BGR'
            if x.ndim == 3:
                x = x[::-1, ...]
            else:
                x = x[:, ::-1, ...]
        else:
            # 'RGB'->'BGR'
            x = x[..., ::-1]
        mean = [103.939, 116.779, 123.68]
        std = None

    # Zero-center by mean pixel
    if data_format == 'channels_first':
        if x.ndim == 3:
            x[0, :, :] -= mean[0]
            x[1, :, :] -= mean[1]
            x[2, :, :] -= mean[2]
            if std is not None:
                x[0, :, :] /= std[0]
                x[1, :, :] /= std[1]
                x[2, :, :] /= std[2]
        else:
            x[:, 0, :, :] -= mean[0]
            x[:, 1, :, :] -= mean[1]
            x[:, 2, :, :] -= mean[2]
            if std is not None:
                x[:, 0, :, :] /= std[0]
                x[:, 1, :, :] /= std[1]
                x[:, 2, :, :] /= std[2]
    else:
        x[..., 0] -= mean[0]
        x[..., 1] -= mean[1]
        x[..., 2] -= mean[2]
        if std is not None:
            x[..., 0] /= std[0]
            x[..., 1] /= std[1]
            x[..., 2] /= std[2]
    return x

```

By ensuring that `x` is converted to the appropriate data type before performing calculations, the bug that caused the type mismatch leading to the error should be fixed.
