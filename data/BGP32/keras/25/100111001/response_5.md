### Bug Explanation
The bug in the `_preprocess_numpy_input` function arises from attempting to perform arithmetic operations on an input array `x` of type `int32` in a way that violates the data type compatibility required by NumPy ufuncs. Specifically, when the `mode` is not 'tf' or 'torch', the function directly subtracts the `mean` values from the `x` array which leads to mismatched data types; the `mean` values are `float64` and the `x` array is of type `int32`, causing a `UFuncTypeError`.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix this bug, we need to ensure that all arithmetic operations are performed between arrays of compatible data types. In this case, we should convert the `x` array to a floating point data type before applying operations that involve floating point values like the `mean`.

### Corrected Function

```python
def _preprocess_numpy_input(x, data_format, mode):
    """Preprocesses a Numpy array encoding a batch of images.

    # Arguments
        x: Input array, 3D or 4D.
        data_format: Data format of the image array.
        mode: One of "caffe", "tf" or "torch".
            - caffe: will convert the images from RGB to BGR,
                then will zero-center each color channel with
                respect to the ImageNet dataset,
                without scaling.
            - tf: will scale pixels between -1 and 1,
                sample-wise.
            - torch: will scale pixels between 0 and 1 and then
                will normalize each channel with respect to the
                ImageNet dataset.

    # Returns
        Preprocessed Numpy array.
    """
    x = x.astype('float32')  # Convert x to float32

    if mode == 'tf':
        x /= 127.5
        x -= 1.
        return x

    if mode == 'torch':
        x /= 255.

            x = x[..., ::-1]

        if x.ndim == 3:

            x[1, :, :] -= mean[1]
            x[2, :, :] -= mean[2]
            if std is not None:
                x[0, :, :] /= std[0]
                x[1, :, :] /= std[1]
                x[2, :, :] /= std[2]
        else:
            x[:, 0, :, :] -= mean[0]
            x[:, 1, :, :] -= mean[1]
            x[:, 2, :, :] -= mean[2]
            if std is not None:
                x[:, 0, :, :] /= std[0]
                x[:, 1, :, :] /= std[1]
                x[:, 2, :, :] /= std[2]
    else:
        x[..., 0] -= mean[0]
        x[..., 1] -= mean[1]
        x[..., 2] -= mean[2]
        if std is not None:
            x[..., 0] /= std[0]
            x[..., 1] /= std[1]
            x[..., 2] /= std[2]
    return x
```

By converting `x` to `float32` at the beginning of the function, we ensure that all subsequent arithmetic operations are performed with compatible data types, resolving the `UFuncTypeError` issue.
