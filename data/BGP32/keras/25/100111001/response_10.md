### Bug Explanation
The bug occurs due to attempting to subtract a float value from an integer array. In this specific case, the error arises when trying to subtract the mean values from the input array `x`, which is of type `int32`. The mean values are floating-point numbers, causing a `UFuncTypeError` when trying to perform this operation.

### Bug Fix
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that operations involving float values do not conflict with integer types. In this case, we can cast the input array `x` to a floating-point array before performing operations that involve float values.

### Corrected Version of the Function
```python
def _preprocess_numpy_input(x, data_format, mode):
    """Preprocesses a Numpy array encoding a batch of images.

    # Arguments
        x: Input array, 3D or 4D.
        data_format: Data format of the image array.
        mode: One of "caffe", "tf" or "torch".
            - caffe: will convert the images from RGB to BGR,
                then will zero-center each color channel with
                respect to the ImageNet dataset,
                without scaling.
            - tf: will scale pixels between -1 and 1,
                sample-wise.
            - torch: will scale pixels between 0 and 1 and then
                will normalize each channel with respect to the
                ImageNet dataset.

    # Returns
        Preprocessed Numpy array.
    """
    x = x.astype('float32')  # Cast input array to float32

    if mode == 'tf':
        x /= 127.5
        x -= 1.
        return x

    if mode == 'torch':
        x /= 255.

                x[0, :, :] /= std[0]
                x[1, :, :] /= std[1]
                x[2, :, :] /= std[2]
        else:

                x[:, 0, :, :] /= std[0]
                x[:, 1, :, :] /= std[1]
                x[:, 2, :, :] /= std[2]
    else:
        x[..., 0] -= mean[0]
        x[..., 1] -= mean[1]

    return x
```

By casting `x` to `float32` at the beginning of the `_preprocess_numpy_input` function, we ensure that all subsequent calculations involving floating-point values will not lead to conflicts with integer types. This corrected version of the function should now pass the failing test.
