### Bug Explanation
In the provided function `_preprocess_numpy_input`, when the `mode` is set to `'caffe'`, the function correctly processes the input array `x` by converting RGB to BGR and then zero-centering each channel with respect to the ImageNet dataset without scaling. However, the bug occurs when the data type of the input array `x` changes during this process from `float` to `int`, which leads to a type mismatch error when trying to subtract values.

The error message specifically states that there is a `UFuncTypeError: Cannot cast ufunc 'subtract' output from dtype('float64') to dtype('int32') with casting rule 'same_kind'`. This error occurs when trying to subtract a floating-point value (mean) from an integer value (`x`). The function assumes that the original input `x` is a float array but does not handle the case where `x` is an integer array, leading to the type mismatch error.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the calculation within the function `_preprocess_numpy_input` is done with the correct data types. Specifically, when performing operations involving mean values, we should ensure that the input array `x` is maintained as a float array to avoid type conversion issues.

### Corrected Version of the Function

```python
def _preprocess_numpy_input(x, data_format, mode):
    """Preprocesses a Numpy array encoding a batch of images.

    # Arguments
        x: Input array, 3D or 4D.
        data_format: Data format of the image array.
        mode: One of "caffe", "tf" or "torch".
            - caffe: will convert the images from RGB to BGR,
                then will zero-center each color channel with
                respect to the ImageNet dataset,
                without scaling.
            - tf: will scale pixels between -1 and 1,
                sample-wise.
            - torch: will scale pixels between 0 and 1 and then
                will normalize each channel with respect to the
                ImageNet dataset.

By explicitly converting `x` to a float array at the beginning of the function, we ensure that subsequent operations involving floating-point values are consistent and the type mismatch error is avoided. This corrected version should now pass the failing test.
