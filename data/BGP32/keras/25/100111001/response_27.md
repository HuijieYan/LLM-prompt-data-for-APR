### Bug Explanation
The bug occurs when the `mode` is set to `'caffe'` and the `data_format` is `'channels_last'`. In this case, the code attempts to subtract the `mean` values from the input array `x`, which results in a type error because `x` is of type `int32` and mean values are of type `float64`. The numpy ufunc `subtract` cannot cast the output from `float64` to `int32`.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the `x` array is of the appropriate type to perform the subtraction with the `mean` values. We can either change the type of `x` array to `float64` or ensure that the mean values are cast to `int32` before performing the subtraction.

### Corrected Function
```python
def _preprocess_numpy_input(x, data_format, mode):
    """Preprocesses a Numpy array encoding a batch of images.

    # Arguments
        x: Input array, 3D or 4D.
        data_format: Data format of the image array.
        mode: One of "caffe", "tf" or "torch".
            - caffe: will convert the images from RGB to BGR,
                then will zero-center each color channel with
                respect to the ImageNet dataset,
                without scaling.
            - tf: will scale pixels between -1 and 1,
                sample-wise.
            - torch: will scale pixels between 0 and 1 and then
                will normalize each channel with respect to the
                ImageNet dataset.

    # Returns
        Preprocessed Numpy array.

By adding the `.astype('float64')` conversion where necessary, we ensure that the input `x` array is of the right type to perform the subtraction without running into type errors.
