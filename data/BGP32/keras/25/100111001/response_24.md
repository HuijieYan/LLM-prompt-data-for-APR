### Bug Explanation
The bug occurs when the input `mode` is `'caffe'`, and the input `data_format` is `'channels_last'`. In this case, the function tries to subtract the `mean` values from the input array `x` of type `int32`, resulting in a `UFuncTypeError` because the operation involves casting from `float64` to `int32`, which is not allowed.

### Bug Fix
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the input array `x` is converted to a floating-point type before performing operations that involve float values. This can be accomplished using the `astype` method to convert `x` to a float type before applying the mean subtraction.

### Corrected Version of the Function

```python
def _preprocess_numpy_input(x, data_format, mode):
    """Preprocesses a Numpy array encoding a batch of images.

    # Arguments
        x: Input array, 3D or 4D.
        data_format: Data format of the image array.
        mode: One of "caffe", "tf" or "torch".
            - caffe: will convert the images from RGB to BGR,
                then will zero-center each color channel with
                respect to the ImageNet dataset,
                without scaling.
            - tf: will scale pixels between -1 and 1,
                sample-wise.
            - torch: will scale pixels between 0 and 1 and then
                will normalize each channel with respect to the
                ImageNet dataset.

    # Returns
        Preprocessed Numpy array.

By converting `x` to `float32` type at the beginning of the function, we ensure that subsequent arithmetic operations involving float values are valid. This corrected version should pass the failing test.
