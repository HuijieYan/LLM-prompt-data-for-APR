### Bug Explanation
The bug occurs when the input `x` is of dtype `int32` and the `mode` is not `'tf'` or `'torch'`. In this case, when trying to subtract the mean values from each channel, the subtraction operation between `int32` and `float64` types causes a `UFuncTypeError` since numpy cannot cast the output from `float64` to `int32`.

### Bug Fix
To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the input `x` is converted to a floating-point dtype before performing any division or subtraction operations on it. We can achieve this by explicitly converting `x` to a floating-point dtype at the beginning of the `_preprocess_numpy_input` function.

### Corrected Version of the Function

```python
import numpy as np

def _preprocess_numpy_input(x, data_format, mode):
    x = x.astype('float64')  # convert x to float dtype

    """Preprocesses a Numpy array encoding a batch of images.

    # Arguments
        x: Input array, 3D or 4D.
        data_format: Data format of the image array.
        mode: One of "caffe", "tf" or "torch".
            - caffe: will convert the images from RGB to BGR,
                then will zero-center each color channel with
                respect to the ImageNet dataset,
                without scaling.
            - tf: will scale pixels between -1 and 1,
                sample-wise.
            - torch: will scale pixels between 0 and 1 and then
                will normalize each channel with respect to the
                ImageNet dataset.

    # Returns
        Preprocessed Numpy array.
