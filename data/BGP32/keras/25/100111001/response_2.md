### Bug Explanation:
The bug occurs when the `mode` is set to `'caffe'` and the `data_format` is `'channels_last'`. In this case, the function tries to subtract the `mean` values from the input `x`, which leads to a casting error because `x` is of type `int32` and the `mean` values are of type `float64`. This mismatch in data types causes the error `UFuncTypeError: Cannot cast ufunc 'subtract' output from dtype('float64') to dtype('int32')`.

### Bug Fix:
To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the `mean` values are converted to the same data type as the input `x` before subtraction. Since `x` is of type `int32`, we should convert the `mean` values to `int32` before performing the subtraction.

### Corrected Version:

```python
def _preprocess_numpy_input(x, data_format, mode):
    if mode == 'tf':
        x /= 127.5
        x -= 1.
        return x

    if mode == 'torch':
        x /= 255.
        mean = [0.485, 0.456, 0.406]
        std = [0.229, 0.224, 0.225]
    else:
        if data_format == 'channels_first':
            if x.ndim == 3:
                x = x[::-1, ...]
            else:
                x = x[:, ::-1, ...]
        else:
            x = x[..., ::-1]
        mean = [103.939, 116.779, 123.68]
        std = None

    if not all(isinstance(m, int) for m in mean):  # Convert mean to int32 if not already
        mean = [int(m) for m in mean]

    if data_format == 'channels_first':
        if x.ndim == 3:
            x[0, :, :] -= mean[0]
            x[1, :, :] -= mean[1]
            x[2, :, :] -= mean[2]
            if std is not None:
                x[0, :, :] /= std[0]
                x[1, :, :] /= std[1]
                x[2, :, :] /= std[2]
        else:
            x[:, 0, :, :] -= mean[0]
            x[:, 1, :, :] -= mean[1]
            x[:, 2, :, :] -= mean[2]
            if std is not None:
                x[:, 0, :, :] /= std[0]
                x[:, 1, :, :] /= std[1]
                x[:, 2, :, :] /= std[2]
    else:
        x[..., 0] -= mean[0]
        x[..., 1] -= mean[1]
        x[..., 2] -= mean[2]
        if std is not None:
            x[..., 0] /= std[0]
            x[..., 1] /= std[1]
            x[..., 2] /= std[2]
    return x
``` 

By ensuring that the `mean` values are of the same data type as the input `x`, we prevent the casting error and fix the bug.
