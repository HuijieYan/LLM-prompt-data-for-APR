### Bug Analysis:
The bug occurs when the `mode` is set to `'caffe'` or `'torch'` and `data_format` is not `'tf'`. In these cases, the function tries to subtract the `mean` values from the input array `x` which leads to a `UFuncTypeError` when the input array `x` is of type `int32` and the mean values are `float`.

### Bug Explanation:
When the `mode` is set to `'caffe'` or `'torch'`, and `data_format` is not `'tf', the function attempts to subtract the mean values from the input array `x`. However, for the failing test example where `x` is of type `int32` and the mean values are `float`, the subtraction operation results in a `UFuncTypeError` because it tries to cast the output to `int32` but the result remains a `float`.

### Bug Fix:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that when the `mode` is set to `'caffe'` or `'torch'`, and `data_format` is not `'tf'`, the input array `x` is converted to a floating-point type before performing the subtraction operation.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def _preprocess_numpy_input(x, data_format, mode):
    if mode == 'tf':
        x /= 127.5
        x -= 1.
        return x

    if mode == 'torch':
        x = x.astype('float32')  # Convert x to float32 type
        x /= 255.
        mean = [0.485, 0.456, 0.406]
        std = [0.229, 0.224, 0.225]
    else:
        if data_format == 'channels_first':
            if x.ndim == 3:
                x = x[::-1, ...]
            else:
                x = x[:, ::-1, ...]
        else:
            x = x[..., ::-1]
        mean = [103.939, 116.779, 123.68]
        std = None

    if mode != 'tf':
        x = x.astype('float32')  # Convert x to float32 type before processing

    if data_format == 'channels_first':
        if x.ndim == 3:
            x[0, :, :] -= mean[0]
            x[1, :, :] -= mean[1]
            x[2, :, :] -= mean[2]
            if std is not None:
                x[0, :, :] /= std[0]
                x[1, :, :] /= std[1]
                x[2, :, :] /= std[2]
        else:
            x[:, 0, :, :] -= mean[0]
            x[:, 1, :, :] -= mean[1]
            x[:, 2, :, :] -= mean[2]
            if std is not None:
                x[:, 0, :, :] /= std[0]
                x[:, 1, :, :] /= std[1]
                x[:, 2, :, :] /= std[2]
    else:
        x[..., 0] -= mean[0]
        x[..., 1] -= mean[1]
        x[..., 2] -= mean[2]
        if std is not None:
            x[..., 0] /= std[0]
            x[..., 1] /= std[1]
            x[..., 2] /= std[2]
    return x
```

By converting the `x` input array to `float32` type before processing, we ensure that the subtraction operation with `float` mean values will not result in a `UFuncTypeError`. This corrected version should pass the failing test cases.
