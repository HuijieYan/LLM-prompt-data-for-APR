### Error Analysis
The error message indicates a `UFuncTypeError` due to the inability to cast the output of the `subtract` operation from `float64` to `int32`. This error occurs in the line `x[..., 0] -= mean[0]` within the `else` block where `mode` is not 'tf' or 'torch'.

### Bug Cause
The bug is caused by attempting to subtract a `float64` value from an `int32` array element in the line `x[..., 0] -= mean[0]`.

### Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that `mean` values are preserved as `float64` values when subtracting from the array elements.

### Corrected Function
```python
def _preprocess_numpy_input(x, data_format, mode):
    """Preprocesses a Numpy array encoding a batch of images.

    # Arguments
        x: Input array, 3D or 4D.
        data_format: Data format of the image array.
        mode: One of "caffe", "tf" or "torch".
            - caffe: will convert the images from RGB to BGR,
                then will zero-center each color channel with
                respect to the ImageNet dataset,
                without scaling.
            - tf: will scale pixels between -1 and 1,
                sample-wise.
            - torch: will scale pixels between 0 and 1 and then
                will normalize each channel with respect to the
                ImageNet dataset.

    # Returns
        Preprocessed Numpy array.

By ensuring that the `mean` values are converted to `float64` and subtracted from the array elements accordingly, this corrected function should pass the failing test.
