### Bug Analysis:
The bug occurs when the input parameter `mode` is set to `'torch'`, leading to a type error when trying to subtract `mean` values from elements of array `x`. The error message indicates that there is a failure when trying to subtract a float value from an `int32` type element of the array.

### Bug Explanation:
The bug arises because the `x` array is initialized with elements of type `int32` in the failing test, but the preprocessing operation in the `_preprocess_numpy_input` function involves subtracting floating-point values (the `mean` values) from the elements of the array. This causes a `UFuncTypeError` since the subtraction operation tries to cast `float64` to `int32`, which is not a permitted type conversion.

### Bug Fix:
To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the `x` array is operating with float elements to allow subtraction operations with float `mean` values. We can achieve this by converting the `x` array to float type before the preprocessing steps are applied.

### Corrected Code:
Here is the corrected version of the `_preprocess_numpy_input` function:

```python
def _preprocess_numpy_input(x, data_format, mode):
    if mode == 'tf':
        x = x.astype('float32')  # Ensure x is float
        x /= 127.5
        x -= 1.
        return x

    if mode == 'torch':
        x = x.astype('float32')  # Ensure x is float
        x /= 255.
        mean = [0.485, 0.456, 0.406]
        std = [0.229, 0.224, 0.225]
    else:
        if data_format == 'channels_first':
            # 'RGB'->'BGR'
            if x.ndim == 3:
                x = x[::-1, ...]
            else:
                x = x[:, ::-1, ...]
        else:
            # 'RGB'->'BGR'
            x = x[..., ::-1]
        mean = [103.939, 116.779, 123.68]
        std = None

    # Zero-center by mean pixel
    if data_format == 'channels_first':
        if x.ndim == 3:
            x[0, :, :] -= mean[0]
            x[1, :, :] -= mean[1]
            x[2, :, :] -= mean[2]
            if std is not None:
                x[0, :, :] /= std[0]
                x[1, :, :] /= std[1]
                x[2, :, :] /= std[2]
        else:
            x[:, 0, :, :] -= mean[0]
            x[:, 1, :, :] -= mean[1]
            x[:, 2, :, :] -= mean[2]
            if std is not None:
                x[:, 0, :, :] /= std[0]
                x[:, 1, :, :] /= std[1]
                x[:, 2, :, :] /= std[2]
    else:
        x[..., 0] -= mean[0]
        x[..., 1] -= mean[1]
        x[..., 2] -= mean[2]
        if std is not None:
            x[..., 0] /= std[0]
            x[..., 1] /= std[1]
            x[..., 2] /= std[2]
    return x
```

Now, converting `x` to float32 helps avoid type conversion issues during subtraction operations, ensuring the correct preprocessing of the input array.
