### Bug Explanation
The bug occurs in the case where `mode='torch'` and `data_format='channels_last'`. When the calculation `x[..., 0] -= mean[0]` is performed, the subtraction operation creates floating-point values whereas `x` is of type `int32`, leading to a type mismatch error when trying to assign floating-point values to an `int32` array.

### Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the calculations inside the function are consistent with the data type of the input array `x`. We can achieve this by converting `x` to float before performing the subtraction operations.

### Corrected Version of the Function

```python
def _preprocess_numpy_input(x, data_format, mode):
    """Preprocesses a Numpy array encoding a batch of images.

    # Arguments
        x: Input array, 3D or 4D.
        data_format: Data format of the image array.
        mode: One of "caffe", "tf" or "torch".
            - caffe: will convert the images from RGB to BGR,
                then will zero-center each color channel with
                respect to the ImageNet dataset,
                without scaling.
            - tf: will scale pixels between -1 and 1,
                sample-wise.
            - torch: will scale pixels between 0 and 1 and then
                will normalize each channel with respect to the
                ImageNet dataset.

    # Returns
        Preprocessed Numpy array.
    """
    x = x.astype('float32') # Convert x to float

    if mode == 'tf':
        x /= 127.5

        else:
            x[:, 0, ...] -= mean[0]
            x[:, 1, ...] -= mean[1]
            x[:, 2, ...] -= mean[2]
            if std is not None:
                x[:, 0, ...] /= std[0]

    else:
        x[..., 0] -= mean[0]

        x[..., 2] -= mean[2]
        if std is not None:
            x[..., 0] /= std[0]
            x[..., 1] /= std[1]
            x[..., 2] /= std[2]
    
    return x
``` 

By converting `x` to `float32` at the beginning of the function, we ensure that all subsequent operations maintain data consistency and prevent the type mismatch error.
