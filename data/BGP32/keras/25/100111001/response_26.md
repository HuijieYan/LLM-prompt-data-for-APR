### Bug Analysis:
The bug occurs when the input `mode` is `'caffe'` and the `data_format` is `'channels_last'`. In this case, the function tries to subtract the mean values (which are in float) from the input array `x`, which is of type `int32`. This causes a runtime error due to an incompatible subtraction operation between different data types.

### Bug Fix:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the data types of the variables involved in the subtraction operation are compatible. In this case, we can either convert the input array `x` to a float type before performing the subtraction or ensure that the mean values are integer values.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def _preprocess_numpy_input(x, data_format, mode):
    """Preprocesses a Numpy array encoding a batch of images.

    # Arguments
        x: Input array, 3D or 4D.
        data_format: Data format of the image array.
        mode: One of "caffe", "tf" or "torch".
            - caffe: will convert the images from RGB to BGR,
                then will zero-center each color channel with
                respect to the ImageNet dataset,
                without scaling.
            - tf: will scale pixels between -1 and 1,
                sample-wise.
            - torch: will scale pixels between 0 and 1 and then
                will normalize each channel with respect to the
                ImageNet dataset.

    # Returns
        Preprocessed Numpy array.

By converting the input array `x` to float before performing the subtraction, we ensure compatibility of data types and fix the bug.
