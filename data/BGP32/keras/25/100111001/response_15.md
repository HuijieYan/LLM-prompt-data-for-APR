### Bug Explanation:
The bug occurs when the `mode` is set to 'caffe' and the input data is in 'channels_last' format. In this case, the function tries to subtract `mean` values (which are of type float) from the input data `x` (which is of type int32). This results in a type mismatch error during the subtraction operation.

### Bug Fix:
To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the input data `x` is converted to float type before performing the subtraction with the `mean` values.

### Corrected Function:
```python
def _preprocess_numpy_input(x, data_format, mode):
    """Preprocesses a Numpy array encoding a batch of images.

    # Arguments
        x: Input array, 3D or 4D.
        data_format: Data format of the image array.
        mode: One of "caffe", "tf" or "torch".
            - caffe: will convert the images from RGB to BGR,
                then will zero-center each color channel with
                respect to the ImageNet dataset,
                without scaling.
            - tf: will scale pixels between -1 and 1,
                sample-wise.
            - torch: will scale pixels between 0 and 1 and then
                will normalize each channel with respect to the
                ImageNet dataset.

    # Returns
        Preprocessed Numpy array.
