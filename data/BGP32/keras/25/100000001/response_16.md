## Analysis:
The bug in the function `_preprocess_numpy_input` is related to the calculation of mean and standard deviation values for normalization in the `torch` mode. The `mean` and `std` values are defined inside the `if mode == 'torch'` block but used outside of it without considering the indentation levels properly.

## Bug:
The bug occurs when the mode is set to 'torch' because the mean and std values are not correctly assigned and used when calculating the normalized values.

## Fix:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the `mean` and `std` values are assigned and used correctly within the block for the 'torch' mode. We need to indent the code for mean and std assignment to match the scope of the 'torch' mode before using them for normalization calculations.

## Updated Function:
```python
def _preprocess_numpy_input(x, data_format, mode):
    """Preprocesses a Numpy array encoding a batch of images.

    # Arguments
        x: Input array, 3D or 4D.
        data_format: Data format of the image array.
        mode: One of "caffe", "tf" or "torch".
            - caffe: will convert the images from RGB to BGR,
                then will zero-center each color channel with
                respect to the ImageNet dataset,
                without scaling.
            - tf: will scale pixels between -1 and 1,
                sample-wise.
            - torch: will scale pixels between 0 and 1 and then
                will normalize each channel with respect to the
                ImageNet dataset.
