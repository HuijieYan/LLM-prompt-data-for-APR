The buggy function `_preprocess_numpy_input` has an error where the input array `x` is modified directly without creating a copy, leading to unintended changes to the original input.

The bug occurs in cases where the `mode` is not 'tf' or 'torch' and the data format is not 'channels_first'. In these cases, the function applies transformations directly to the input `x`, affecting the original array.

To fix this bug, a copy of the input array `x` needs to be created at the beginning of the function, and all transformations should be applied to the copy. This way, the original input array remains unchanged.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _preprocess_numpy_input(x, data_format, mode):
    """Preprocesses a Numpy array encoding a batch of images.

    # Arguments
        x: Input array, 3D or 4D.
        data_format: Data format of the image array.
        mode: One of "caffe", "tf" or "torch".
            - caffe: will convert the images from RGB to BGR,
                then will zero-center each color channel with
                respect to the ImageNet dataset,
                without scaling.
            - tf: will scale pixels between -1 and 1,
                sample-wise.
            - torch: will scale pixels between 0 and 1 and then
                will normalize each channel with respect to the
                ImageNet dataset.

        Preprocessed Numpy array.
