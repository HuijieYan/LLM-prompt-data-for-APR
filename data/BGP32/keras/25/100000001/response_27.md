## Explanation of the bug:
The bug lies in the calculation of mean and std when the mode is 'torch'. In this case, mean and std are assigned but not used subsequently in the calculations for normalization, leading to incorrect preprocessing of the input array.

## Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to implement the correct normalization calculations based on the 'torch' mode by utilizing the mean and std values assigned.

## Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def _preprocess_numpy_input(x, data_format, mode):
    """Preprocesses a Numpy array encoding a batch of images.

    # Arguments
        x: Input array, 3D or 4D.
        data_format: Data format of the image array.
        mode: One of "caffe", "tf" or "torch".
            - caffe: will convert the images from RGB to BGR,
                then will zero-center each color channel with
                respect to the ImageNet dataset,
                without scaling.
            - tf: will scale pixels between -1 and 1,
                sample-wise.
            - torch: will scale pixels between 0 and 1 and then
                will normalize each channel with respect to the
                ImageNet dataset.

    # Returns
        Preprocessed Numpy array.
