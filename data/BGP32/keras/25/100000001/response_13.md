## Bug Analysis:
The bug in the `_preprocess_numpy_input` function lies in the calculation of mean and standard deviation values for the 'torch' mode. When `mode` is 'torch', the function calculates `mean` and `std` values, but it does not correctly normalize the input array `x` based on these values.

## Error Location:
The error occurs in the calculation of the mean and standard deviation values for the 'torch' mode, as well as in the subsequent normalization of the input array `x`.

## Cause of the Bug:
When the mode is 'torch', the code calculates the mean and standard deviation values, but it misses the step of normalizing the input array `x` using these values. As a result, the 'torch' mode does not perform the intended preprocessing steps correctly.

## Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the input array `x` is properly normalized using the calculated `mean` and `std` values when the mode is 'torch'. This involves dividing the input array by 255 (to scale between 0 and 1), subtracting the `mean` values element-wise, and then dividing by the `std` values (if they are not None).

## Corrected Version of the Function:
Here is the corrected version of the `_preprocess_numpy_input` function:

```python
def _preprocess_numpy_input(x, data_format, mode):
    if mode == 'tf':
        x /= 127.5
        x -= 1.
        return x

    if mode == 'torch':
        x /= 255.
        mean = [0.485, 0.456, 0.406]
        std = [0.229, 0.224, 0.225]
        x[..., 0] -= mean[0]
        x[..., 1] -= mean[1]
        x[..., 2] -= mean[2]
        if std is not None:
            x[..., 0] /= std[0]
            x[..., 1] /= std[1]
            x[..., 2] /= std[2]
        return x

    else:
        if data_format == 'channels_first':
            if x.ndim == 3:
                x = x[::-1, ...]
            else:
                x = x[:, ::-1, ...]
        else:
            x = x[..., ::-1]
        mean = [103.939, 116.779, 123.68]
        std = None

        if data_format == 'channels_first':
            if x.ndim == 3:
                x[0, :, :] -= mean[0]
                x[1, :, :] -= mean[1]
                x[2, :, :] -= mean[2]
                if std is not None:
                    x[0, :, :] /= std[0]
                    x[1, :, :] /= std[1]
                    x[2, :, :] /= std[2]
            else:
                x[:, 0, :, :] -= mean[0]
                x[:, 1, :, :] -= mean[1]
                x[:, 2, :, :] -= mean[2]
                if std is not None:
                    x[:, 0, :, :] /= std[0]
                    x[:, 1, :, :] /= std[1]
                    x[:, 2, :, :] /= std[2]
        else:
            x[..., 0] -= mean[0]
            x[..., 1] -= mean[1]
            x[..., 2] -= mean[2]
            if std is not None:
                x[..., 0] /= std[0]
                x[..., 1] /= std[1]
                x[..., 2] /= std[2]
    return x
``` 

By applying the suggested corrections, the function now correctly preprocesses the input Numpy array based on the specified `mode`, including the correct calculation of mean and standard deviation values for the 'torch' mode.
