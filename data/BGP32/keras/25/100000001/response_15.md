### Analysis:

1. The function `_preprocess_numpy_input` expects an input array `x`, a data format, and a mode.
2. The function applies different preprocessing steps based on the mode specified:
    - If mode is `'tf'`, it scales the pixels between -1 and 1.
    - If mode is `'torch'`, it scales the pixels between 0 and 1 and performs normalization based on pre-defined mean and std values.
    - For any other mode, it handles conversion of image channels format and applies predefined mean values.
3. Potential error locations:
    - In the 'torch' mode, mean and std values calculation is correct, but the normalization operation is not handled properly.
    - In the data_format conditional block, there are checks and operations based on dimensions but inconsistency in handling 3D and 4D input arrays.
4. Cause of the bug:
    - In the 'torch' mode, the function incorrectly calculates mean and std values but does not correctly normalize the image data.
    - In the data_format conditional block, inconsistent handling of dimensions may lead to incorrect operations on the input array.
5. Strategy for fixing the bug:
    - Modify the 'torch' mode normalization section to correctly normalize the image data.
    - Ensure consistent operations based on data_format and dimensions of the input array.

### Corrected Version:

```python
def _preprocess_numpy_input(x, data_format, mode):
    if mode == 'tf':
        x /= 127.5
        x -= 1.
        return x

    if mode == 'torch':
        x /= 255.
        mean = [0.485, 0.456, 0.406]
        std = [0.229, 0.224, 0.225]
        # Normalize each channel with respect to ImageNet dataset
        x[..., 0] = (x[..., 0] - mean[0]) / std[0]
        x[..., 1] = (x[..., 1] - mean[1]) / std[1]
        x[..., 2] = (x[..., 2] - mean[2]) / std[2]
        return x

    if data_format == 'channels_first':
        if x.ndim == 3:
            x[:, 0, :, :] -= mean[0]
            x[:, 1, :, :] -= mean[1]
            x[:, 2, :, :] -= mean[2]
            if std is not None:
                x[:, 0, :, :] /= std[0]
                x[:, 1, :, :] /= std[1]
                x[:, 2, :, :] /= std[2]
        else:
            x[0, :, :] -= mean[0]
            x[1, :, :] -= mean[1]
            x[2, :, :] -= mean[2]
            if std is not None:
                x[0, :, :] /= std[0]
                x[1, :, :] /= std[1]
                x[2, :, :] /= std[2]
    else:
        x[..., 0] -= mean[0]
        x[..., 1] -= mean[1]
        x[..., 2] -= mean[2]
        if std is not None:
            x[..., 0] /= std[0]
            x[..., 1] /= std[1]
            x[..., 2] /= std[2]
    return x
```

This corrected version handles the normalization in the 'torch' mode correctly and ensures consistent operations in the data_format conditional block based on the input array dimensions and format.
