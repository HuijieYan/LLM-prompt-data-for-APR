## Analysis:
The buggy function `_preprocess_numpy_input` is designed to preprocess a Numpy array encoding a batch of images based on the given `mode` and `data_format`.

## Errors:
1. In the `else` block, the mean and std values are not assigned for the `mode` options 'caffe' and 'torch'.
2. In the `else` block, the mean and std values are based on 'BGR' conversion but this conversion is done before the mean subtraction which might lead to incorrect preprocessing.
3. In the 'torch' mode, the channel-wise normalization with respect to the ImageNet dataset is missing for the input.

## Bug Explanation:
The bug in the function is primarily due to missing logic for assigning mean and std values correctly based on the 'mode' input. Additionally, there is an inconsistency in the preprocessing steps based on 'mode', leading to incorrect results.

## Fix Strategy:
1. Properly assign mean and std values based on the 'mode'.
2. Ensure consistency in preprocessing steps for different modes by following the correct sequence of operations.

## Corrected Function:
```python
def _preprocess_numpy_input(x, data_format, mode):
    if mode == 'tf':
        x /= 127.5
        x -= 1.
        return x

    if mode == 'torch':
        x /= 255.
        mean = [0.485, 0.456, 0.406]  # Mean for channel-wise normalization
        std = [0.229, 0.224, 0.225]    # Std for channel-wise normalization
        x[..., 0] -= mean[0]
        x[..., 1] -= mean[1]
        x[..., 2] -= mean[2]
        x[..., 0] /= std[0]
        x[..., 1] /= std[1]
        x[..., 2] /= std[2]
    else:
        if data_format == 'channels_first':
            if x.ndim == 3:
                x[::-1, ...]  # 'RGB' -> 'BGR'
            else:
                x[:, ::-1, ...]

        else:
            x[..., ::-1]  # 'RGB' -> 'BGR'
        mean = [103.939, 116.779, 123.68]  # Mean for zero-centering
        std = None

        x[..., 0] -= mean[0]
        x[..., 1] -= mean[1]
        x[..., 2] -= mean[2]
        if std is not None:
            x[..., 0] /= std[0]
            x[..., 1] /= std[1]
            x[..., 2] /= std[2]

    return x
```

This corrected version assigns the correct mean and std values based on the 'mode' input and adjusts the preprocessing steps to ensure consistency and correctness in the image preprocessing.
