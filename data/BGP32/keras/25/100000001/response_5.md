### Analysis:
The buggy function `_preprocess_numpy_input` is intended to preprocess a numpy array encoding a batch of images based on the specified `data_format` and `mode`. The bug seems to be related to incorrect processing when `mode` is not 'tf' or 'torch'. There is a potential issue with zero-centering of the image array as the calculation might be incorrect. Additionally, the function may not operate as expected when the input array has different dimensions.

### Bugs in the Buggy Function:
1. In the `else` block after checking if `mode` is not 'tf' or 'torch':
    - The image array is converted from RGB to BGR without considering the `data_format`.
    - The calculation for zero-centering by mean pixel is incorrect and may cause issues in normalization.

### Bug Cause:
The main cause of the bug is the improper handling of the image array when the `mode` is not 'tf' or 'torch'. Incorrect calculations for zero-centering and normalizing the array can lead to unexpected output.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To address the bug, we need to make sure that the conversion to BGR is performed according to the `data_format` specified. Additionally, we need to correctly zero-center and normalize the image array based on the mean and std values provided.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def _preprocess_numpy_input(x, data_format, mode):
    if mode == 'tf':
        x /= 127.5
        x -= 1.
        return x

    if mode == 'torch':
        x /= 255.
        mean = [0.485, 0.456, 0.406]
        std = [0.229, 0.224, 0.225]
    else:
        if data_format == 'channels_first':
            # 'RGB'->'BGR'
            if x.ndim == 3:
                x = x[:, ::-1, ...]
            else:
                x = x[:, :, ::-1, ...]
        else:
            # 'RGB'->'BGR'
            x = x[..., ::-1]
        mean = [103.939, 116.779, 123.68]
        std = None

    if std is not None:
        x -= mean
        x /= std
    else:
        x -= mean

    return x
```

In the corrected version:
- The conversion to BGR is done based on the `data_format`.
- The zero-centering and normalization calculation is adjusted to correctly preprocess the image array.
- The corrected version should now handle the preprocessing of the image array appropriately for different modes and `data_format`.
