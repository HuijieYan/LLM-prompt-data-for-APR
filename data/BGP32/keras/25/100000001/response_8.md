## Analysis:
The buggy function `_preprocess_numpy_input` is intended to preprocess a Numpy array encoding a batch of images based on the provided `mode`, `data_format`, and specific operations for each mode. The bug seems to be related to incorrect handling of the `mode` argument, specifically the `else` block where `data_format` is considered along with the image manipulation steps.

## Potential Error Locations:
1. The assignment of `mean` and `std` in the `else` block related to the handling of `data_format`.
2. Zero-centering and normalization operations based on the `data_format`.

## Bug Explanation:
The bug arises from incorrectly handling the `mode` argument within the function. When the `mode` is neither 'tf' nor 'torch', the function proceeds with the `else` block where it involves manipulations based on the `data_format`. The bug occurs when `data_format` is not 'channels_first'. In this case, the function incorrectly applies the mean subtraction and division by standard deviation, which should actually be skipped when `std` is `None`.

## Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
1. Adjust the assignment of `mean` and `std` in the `else` block to align with the requirements based on the conditions.
2. Skip the zero-centering and normalization operations when `std` is `None`.

## Corrected Version:
```python
def _preprocess_numpy_input(x, data_format, mode):
    if mode == 'tf':
        x /= 127.5
        x -= 1.
        return x

    if mode == 'torch':
        x /= 255.
        mean = [0.485, 0.456, 0.406]
        std = [0.229, 0.224, 0.225]
    else:
        if data_format == 'channels_first':
            if x.ndim == 3:
                x = x[::-1, ...]
            else:
                x = x[:, ::-1, ...]
            mean = [103.939, 116.779, 123.68]
            std = None
        else:
            x = x[..., ::-1]
            mean = [103.939, 116.779, 123.68]
            std = None

    if std is not None:
        if data_format == 'channels_first':
            if x.ndim == 3:
                for i in range(3):
                    x[i, :, :] -= mean[i]
                    x[i, :, :] /= std[i]
            else:
                for i in range(3):
                    x[:, i, :, :] -= mean[i]
                    x[:, i, :, :] /= std[i]
        else:
            for i in range(3):
                x[..., i] -= mean[i]
                x[..., i] /= std[i]
    else:
        if data_format == 'channels_first':
            for i in range(3):
                if x.ndim == 3:
                    x[i, :, :] -= mean[i]
                else:
                    x[:, i, :, :] -= mean[i]
        else:
            for i in range(3):
                x[..., i] -= mean[i]
    return x
``` 

This corrected version addresses the bug by ensuring that the mean subtraction and standard deviation division operations are properly applied based on the provided parameters.
