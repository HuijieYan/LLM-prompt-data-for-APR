## Analysis:
1. The function `_preprocess_numpy_input` takes an input Numpy array `x`, data format, and mode as arguments to preprocess the images.
2. The function has different preprocessing logic based on the mode specified: `'tf'`, `'torch'`, or others.
3. The bug in the code is that the normalization and channel-wise adjustments are not correctly handled for the `'torch'` mode.

## Bug Cause:
- When the mode is `'torch'`, the normalization by dividing by 255 is implemented correctly, but the channel-wise normalization using mean and std from ImageNet dataset is incorrect.
- The `mean` and `std` should be applied to each channel separately for RGB channels, but the current code is not doing so.

## Bug Fix Strategy:
- Update the code to correctly apply mean and std normalization to each channel separately based on the data format.
- Handle the channel-wise normalization for RGB channels correctly when the mode is `'torch'`.
