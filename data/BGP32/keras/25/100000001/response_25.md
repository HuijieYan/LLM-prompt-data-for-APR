Potential Error Locations:
1. In the mode 'tf' block, there might be an issue with the scaling calculation.
2. In the mode 'torch' block, there might be an issue with mean and std calculation.
3. Channel reversing might be implemented incorrectly in the 'else' block.

Cause of the Bug: 
The bug in the original function lies in the calculation of mean and std values based on the data format. Additionally, the scaling calculation in the 'tf' block might not be correct.

Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
1. Correct the scaling calculation in the 'tf' block.
2. Adjust the mean and std calculation in the 'torch' block based on the given description.
3. Verify the channel reversal logic based on the data format.

Code Fix:
```python
def _preprocess_numpy_input(x, data_format, mode):
    if mode == 'tf':
        x /= 127.5
        x -= 1.
        return x

    if mode == 'torch':
        x /= 255.
        mean = [0.485, 0.456, 0.406]
        std = [0.229, 0.224, 0.225]
    else:
        if data_format == 'channels_first':
            if x.ndim == 3:
                x = x[:, ::-1, ...]
            else:
                x = x[:, :, ::-1]
        else:
            x = x[..., ::-1]
        mean = [103.939, 116.779, 123.68]
        std = None

    if data_format == 'channels_first':
        x[0] -= mean[0]
        x[1] -= mean[1]
        x[2] -= mean[2]
        if std is not None:
            x[0] /= std[0]
            x[1] /= std[1]
            x[2] /= std[2]
    else:
        x[..., 0] -= mean[0]
        x[..., 1] -= mean[1]
        x[..., 2] -= mean[2]
        if std is not None:
            x[..., 0] /= std[0]
            x[..., 1] /= std[1]
            x[..., 2] /= std[2]
    return x
```
