The bug in the given function `_preprocess_numpy_input` is related to handling the input data format and mode options properly. The bug arises because the function does not distinguish between the 'caffe' mode and the default case when handling the data format in 'channels_first'.

To fix the bug, we need to include the specific preprocessing steps for the 'caffe' mode along with the appropriate handling of the data format in the default case.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _preprocess_numpy_input(x, data_format, mode):
    """Preprocesses a Numpy array encoding a batch of images.

    # Arguments
        x: Input array, 3D or 4D.
        data_format: Data format of the image array.
        mode: One of "caffe", "tf" or "torch".
            - caffe: will convert the images from RGB to BGR,
                then will zero-center each color channel with
                respect to the ImageNet dataset,
                without scaling.
            - tf: will scale pixels between -1 and 1,
                sample-wise.
            - torch: will scale pixels between 0 and 1 and then
                will normalize each channel with respect to the
                ImageNet dataset.

    # Returns
        Preprocessed Numpy array.
    """
    if mode == 'tf':
        x /= 127.5
        x -= 1.
        return x
    
    if mode == 'torch':
        x /= 255.
        mean = [0.485, 0.456, 0.406]
        std = [0.229, 0.224, 0.225]
    elif mode == 'caffe':
        x = x[..., ::-1]  # Convert RGB to BGR
        mean = [103.939, 116.779, 123.68]
        std = None
    else:  # Default case
        if data_format == 'channels_first':
            if x.ndim == 3:
                x = x[::-1, ...]
            else:
                x = x[:, ::-1, ...]
        else:
            x = x[..., ::-1]
        mean = [103.939, 116.779, 123.68]
        std = None

    if std is not None:
        x -= mean
        x /= std
    else:
        x -= mean

    return x
```

In the corrected version, we included the handling of the 'caffe' mode by converting the image from RGB to BGR if needed. We also ensured that the standardization process was correctly applied based on the mode and data format.

With these changes, the function should now properly preprocess a Numpy array of images according to the specified mode and data format.
