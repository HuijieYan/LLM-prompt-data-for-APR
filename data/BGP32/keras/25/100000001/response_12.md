- Potential error locations:
1. Division by zero: if `std` is None and the mode is not 'tf' or 'torch', there could be division by zero errors.
2. Incorrectly calculating the mean and std values based on data_format and mode.
3. Incorrect adjusting of values based on data_format in channels_first.
4. Potential inconsistency in handling 3D and 4D arrays.

- Cause of the bug:
The bug arises from the incorrect handling of different modes and data formats for preprocessing the input numpy array. In particular, handling the mean and std values based on data_format and mode could lead to incorrect preprocessing.

- Strategy for fixing the bug:
1. Make sure to handle the division by zero scenario by checking if `std` is None before performing division operations.
2. Ensure that the mean and std values are correctly calculated based on the provided mode.
3. Adjust the values in both 'channels_first' and 'channels_last' formats appropriately in the preprocessing step.

- Corrected version of the function:
```python
def _preprocess_numpy_input(x, data_format, mode):
    if mode == 'tf':
        x /= 127.5
        x -= 1.
        return x

    if mode == 'torch':
        x /= 255.
        mean = [0.485, 0.456, 0.406]
        std = [0.229, 0.224, 0.225]
    else:
        if data_format == 'channels_first':
            if x.ndim == 3:
                x = x[:, ::-1, ...]
            else:
                x = x[..., ::-1]
        else:
            x = x[..., ::-1]
        mean = [103.939, 116.779, 123.68]
        std = None

    if std is not None:
        if data_format == 'channels_first':
            x -= mean
            x /= std
        else:
            x -= mean
            x /= std
    else:
        x -= mean
    return x
```
