## Analysis:
The buggy function `_preprocess_numpy_input` is intended to preprocess a numpy array encoding a batch of images based on the specified `mode` and `data_format`. There are potential error locations within this function:
1. In the `tf` mode, dividing by 127.5 and subtracting 1 may not correctly scale the pixels between -1 and 1.
2. The calculation of mean and std arrays within the `torch` mode may not be applied correctly.
3. The zero-centering by mean pixel and normalization may not be performed accurately for different data formats.

## Bug Cause:
The bug in the original function arises from incorrect computations within the `tf` and `torch` modes, leading to incorrect preprocessing of the input array. Additionally, the handling of different data formats for RGB to BGR transformation, channel-wise operations, and mean pixel subtraction is not consistent and needs adjustment.

## Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, the following changes can be implemented:
- Restructure the calculations within the `tf` and `torch` modes to properly scale, normalize, and apply mean/std operations.
- Ensure consistent handling of data format for RGB to BGR transformation and pixel-wise operations.

## Corrected Version of the Function:
Here is the corrected version of the `_preprocess_numpy_input` function:

```python
def _preprocess_numpy_input(x, data_format, mode):
    if mode == 'tf':
        x = (x - 127.5) / 127.5
    elif mode == 'torch':
        x = x / 255.0
        mean = [0.485, 0.456, 0.406]
        std = [0.229, 0.224, 0.225]
        x = (x - mean) / std
    else:
        if data_format == 'channels_first':
            if x.ndim == 3:
                x = x[:, ::-1, ...]
            else:
                x = x[:, :, ::-1, ...]
            mean = [103.939, 116.779, 123.68]
            std = None
        else:
            x = x[..., ::-1]
            mean = [103.939, 116.779, 123.68]
            std = None

        x -= mean
        if std is not None:
            x /= std

    return x
```

In this corrected version:
- The scaling and normalization in the `tf` mode have been updated to properly scale the pixels.
- The calculation of mean and std arrays in the `torch` mode has been corrected.
- Consistent handling of data format for RGB to BGR transformation and channel-wise operations has been applied.
