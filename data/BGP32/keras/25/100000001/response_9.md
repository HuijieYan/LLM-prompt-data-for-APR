## Analysis:
1. The function `_preprocess_numpy_input` takes in an input array, `x`, along with data format and mode options. 
2. The function preprocesses the input array based on the given mode.
3. The bug is identified in the calculation of mean and std values for the mode 'torch' and the subsequent normalization of the input array.
4. The issue arises from not properly initializing and handling the mean and std values when 'mode' is 'torch'.
5. Additionally, the function seems to handle data_format 'channels_first' and 'channels_last' correctly.

## Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Initialize the `mean` and `std` values properly at the beginning of the function for all modes.
2. Update the calculation and normalization of the input array based on the initialized `mean` and `std` values.
3. Ensure the handling of both 'channels_first' and 'channels_last' data formats for all modes.

## Corrected Function:
```python
def _preprocess_numpy_input(x, data_format, mode):
    """Preprocesses a Numpy array encoding a batch of images.

    # Arguments
        x: Input array, 3D or 4D.
        data_format: Data format of the image array.
        mode: One of "caffe", "tf" or "torch".
            - caffe: will convert the images from RGB to BGR,
                then will zero-center each color channel with
                respect to the ImageNet dataset,
                without scaling.
            - tf: will scale pixels between -1 and 1,
                sample-wise.
            - torch: will scale pixels between 0 and 1 and then
                will normalize each channel with respect to the
                ImageNet dataset.

    # Returns
        Preprocessed Numpy array.
