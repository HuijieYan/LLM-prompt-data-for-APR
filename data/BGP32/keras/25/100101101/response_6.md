### Bug Explanation
The bug in the `_preprocess_numpy_input` function stems from the calculations when the mode is set to 'caffe' or 'torch' due to an incorrect calculation of mean values. Additionally, when the `mode` is not 'tf' or 'torch', the code is not properly handling the conversion of RGB to BGR channels.

### Bug Location
1. The calculation of mean values for 'torch' mode is missing the division step by the standard deviation.
2. The conversion of RGB to BGR channels is not correctly implemented for `'channels_first'` format in the 'caffe' mode.

### Bug Fix Strategy
1. Ensure that the calculation of mean values for 'torch' mode includes division by standard deviation.
2. Properly convert RGB to BGR channels for all data formats when the mode is 'caffe'.

### Corrected Function
```python
def _preprocess_numpy_input(x, data_format, mode):
    """Preprocesses a Numpy array encoding a batch of images.

    # Arguments
        x: Input array, 3D or 4D.
        data_format: Data format of the image array.
        mode: One of "caffe", "tf" or "torch".
            - caffe: will convert the images from RGB to BGR,
                then will zero-center each color channel with
                respect to the ImageNet dataset,
                without scaling.
            - tf: will scale pixels between -1 and 1,
                sample-wise.
            - torch: will scale pixels between 0 and 1 and then
                will normalize each channel with respect to the
                ImageNet dataset.

    # Returns
        Preprocessed Numpy array.

        x /= 255.
        mean = [0.485, 0.456, 0.406]

        x[:, 2, :, :] -= mean[2]
        if std is not None:
            x[:, 0, :, :] /= std[0]
            x[:, 1, :, :] /= std[1]
            x[:, 2, :, :] /= std[2]
    else:
        x[..., 0] -= mean[0]
        x[..., 1] -= mean[1]
        x[..., 2] -= mean[2]
        if std is not None:
            x[..., 0] /= std[0]
            x[..., 1] /= std[1]
            x[..., 2] /= std[2]
    
    return x
``` 

After applying these fixes, the `_preprocess_numpy_input` function should correctly preprocess the input array based on the specified mode and data format, passing the failing test cases.
