The bug in the `_preprocess_numpy_input` function is that when the `mode` is not 'tf' or 'torch', the calculation for mean subtraction and channel reversal is not correctly implemented as per the given `data_format`. This leads to incorrect preprocessing of the input array `x`.

### Bug Explanation:
- When `mode` is not 'tf' or 'torch', the function should apply different preprocessing steps depending on the `data_format`. If `data_format` is 'channels_first', RGB channels need to be reversed('RGB' -> 'BGR') and mean subtraction should be applied; otherwise, for 'channels_last' format, only mean subtraction is needed.
- In the buggy function, the mean subtraction and channel reversal are not correctly handled based on the `data_format`. This results in incorrect preprocessing for these cases.

### Strategy for fixing the bug:
1. Separate the preprocessing steps based on the `data_format` correctly.
2. Implement mean subtraction for all channels according to the ImageNet dataset values.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def _preprocess_numpy_input(x, data_format, mode):
    """Preprocesses a Numpy array encoding a batch of images.

    # Arguments
        x: Input array, 3D or 4D.
        data_format: Data format of the image array.
        mode: One of "caffe", "tf" or "torch".
            - caffe: will convert the images from RGB to BGR,
                then will zero-center each color channel with
                respect to the ImageNet dataset,
                without scaling.
            - tf: will scale pixels between -1 and 1,
                sample-wise.
            - torch: will scale pixels between 0 and 1 and then
                will normalize each channel with respect to the
                ImageNet dataset.

    # Returns
        Preprocessed Numpy array.

            x[..., 1] -= mean[1]
            x[..., 2] -= mean[2]

        if std is not None:
            if x.ndim == 3:
                x[0, :, :] /= std[0]
                x[1, :, :] /= std[1]

                x[:, 2, :, :] /= std[2]

    return x
```

By making these corrections, the function should now correctly preprocess the input arrays according to the expected behavior and pass the failing tests provided.
