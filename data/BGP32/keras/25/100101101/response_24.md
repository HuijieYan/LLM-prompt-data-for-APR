### Bug Explanation
The bug lies in the calculation for images in `mode='torch'`. The normalization and scaling processes are not done correctly, which leads to the wrong output values. Specifically, the normalization by dividing by 255 and the subsequent calculation using mean and standard deviation are incorrect.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to adjust the calculations in the `mode='torch'` block to correctly apply the normalization and standardization processes using the provided mean and standard deviation values.

### Corrected Function
```python
def _preprocess_numpy_input(x, data_format, mode):
    if mode == 'tf':
        x /= 127.5
        x -= 1.
        return x

    if mode == 'torch':
        x /= 255.
        mean = [0.485, 0.456, 0.406]
        std = [0.229, 0.224, 0.225]
        x[..., 0] = (x[..., 0] - mean[0]) / std[0]
        x[..., 1] = (x[..., 1] - mean[1]) / std[1]
        x[..., 2] = (x[..., 2] - mean[2]) / std[2]
    else:
        if data_format == 'channels_first':
            if x.ndim == 3:
                x = x[::-1, ...]
            else:
                x = x[:, ::-1, ...]
        else:
            x = x[..., ::-1]
        mean = [103.939, 116.779, 123.68]
        std = None

    if data_format == 'channels_first':
        x[..., 0] -= mean[0]
        x[..., 1] -= mean[1]
        x[..., 2] -= mean[2]
        if std is not None:
            x[..., 0] /= std[0]
            x[..., 1] /= std[1]
            x[..., 2] /= std[2]
    else:
        x[..., 0] -= mean[0]
        x[..., 1] -= mean[1]
        x[..., 2] -= mean[2]
        if std is not None:
            x[..., 0] /= std[0]
            x[..., 1] /= std[1]
            x[..., 2] /= std[2]

    return x
``` 

The corrected function now correctly handles the 'torch' mode to normalize the input array using mean and standard deviation. This should resolve the issues with the failing tests and produce the expected outputs for the given cases.
