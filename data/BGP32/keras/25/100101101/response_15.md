## Bug Explanation:
The bug in the `_preprocess_numpy_input` function lies in the logic implementation for the cases where `mode` is neither `'tf'` nor `'torch'`. In these cases, when `data_format` is `'channels_first'`, the function mistakenly assumes RGB to BGR conversion is necessary and manipulates the array incorrectly. This leads to incorrect preprocessing, which causes the failing test cases.

## Bug Fix:
To fix the bug, we need to correct the RGB to BGR conversion when `data_format` is `'channels_first'`. We should only perform RGB to BGR conversion when `mode` is `'caffe'`, and the correct way to convert in this case is to reverse the channel order. Additionally, the mean subtraction and division by standard deviation should be adjusted accordingly.

## Corrected Function:
```python
def _preprocess_numpy_input(x, data_format, mode):
    if mode == 'tf':
        x /= 127.5
        x -= 1.
        return x

    if mode == 'torch':
        x /= 255.
        mean = [0.485, 0.456, 0.406]
        std = [0.229, 0.224, 0.225]
    elif mode == 'caffe':
        if data_format == 'channels_first':
            mean = [123.68, 116.779, 103.939]
        else:
            mean = [103.939, 116.779, 123.68]
        std = None
    else:
        if data_format == 'channels_first':
            mean = [123.68, 116.779, 103.939]
            x = x[:, ::-1, ...]  # Reverse to convert RGB to BGR
        else:
            mean = [103.939, 116.779, 123.68]
            x = x[..., ::-1]  # Reverse to convert RGB to BGR
    
    if std is not None:
        x[..., 0] -= mean[0]
        x[..., 1] -= mean[1]
        x[..., 2] -= mean[2]
        x[..., 0] /= std[0]
        x[..., 1] /= std[1]
        x[..., 2] /= std[2]
    else:
        x[..., 0] -= mean[0]
        x[..., 1] -= mean[1]
        x[..., 2] -= mean[2]
    
    return x
``` 

By using this corrected version of the function, the failing test cases provided should pass successfully.
