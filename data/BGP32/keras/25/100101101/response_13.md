### Analysis
The buggy function `_preprocess_numpy_input` is designed to preprocess a Numpy array of images based on the provided mode ('caffe', 'tf', 'torch') and data format ('channels_first', 'channels_last'). The bugs are primarily related to incorrect calculations for the mean and std values, leading to incorrect preprocessing of the input array.

### Bugs
1. The normalization for the 'torch' mode is missing; it should divide by the standard deviation values.
2. Incorrect handling of the 'channels_first' data format, causing issues with mean subtraction and scaling.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bugs, we need to:
1. For the 'torch' mode, include the division by standard deviation values.
2. Correct the mean subtraction and scaling based on the data format ('channels_first' or 'channels_last').

### Bug-fixed `_preprocess_numpy_input` Function
```python
def _preprocess_numpy_input(x, data_format, mode):
    if mode == 'tf':
        x /= 127.5
        x -= 1.
        return x

    if mode == 'torch':
        x /= 255.
        mean = [0.485, 0.456, 0.406]
        std = [0.229, 0.224, 0.225]
        x[..., 0] -= mean[0]
        x[..., 1] -= mean[1]
        x[..., 2] -= mean[2]
        x[..., 0] /= std[0]
        x[..., 1] /= std[1]
        x[..., 2] /= std[2]
        return x

    if data_format == 'channels_first':
        # 'RGB'->'BGR'
        if x.ndim == 4:
            x = x[:, ::-1, :, :]
        else:
            x = x[:, :, ::-1, :]
        mean = [103.939, 116.779, 123.68]
        std = None
    else:
        # 'RGB'->'BGR'
        x = x[..., ::-1]
        mean = [103.939, 116.779, 123.68]
        std = None

    # Zero-center by mean pixel
    x[..., 0] -= mean[0]
    x[..., 1] -= mean[1]
    x[..., 2] -= mean[2]
    if std is not None:
        x[..., 0] /= std[0]
        x[..., 1] /= std[1]
        x[..., 2] /= std[2]

    return x
```

By fixing the specified issues in the function, the corrected version should now preprocess the input array correctly according to the expected values and types provided.
