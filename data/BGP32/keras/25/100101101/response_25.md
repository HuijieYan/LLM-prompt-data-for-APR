### Bug Explanation
The bug in the `_preprocess_numpy_input` function arises from the incorrect handling of the 'tf' mode in the function. When the mode is set to 'tf', the function is supposed to scale the input pixel values between -1 and 1, sample-wise. However, the current implementation is dividing the input by 127.5 and subtracting 1 from it, which leads to incorrect preprocessing of the input arrays.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to adjust the preprocessing steps for the 'tf' mode. We should divide the input by 255 (which will scale the values between 0 and 1) and then perform a specific operation to scale the values to -1 and 1, sample-wise.

### Corrected Function
Here is the corrected version of the `_preprocess_numpy_input` function that addresses the bug:

```python
def _preprocess_numpy_input(x, data_format, mode):
    """Preprocesses a Numpy array encoding a batch of images.

    # Arguments
        x: Input array, 3D or 4D.
        data_format: Data format of the image array.
        mode: One of "caffe", "tf" or "torch".
            - caffe: will convert the images from RGB to BGR,
                then will zero-center each color channel with
                respect to the ImageNet dataset,
                without scaling.
            - tf: will scale pixels between -1 and 1, sample-wise.
            - torch: will scale pixels between 0 and 1 and then
                will normalize each channel with respect to the
                ImageNet dataset.

    # Returns
        Preprocessed Numpy array.
    """
    if mode == 'tf':
        # Scale pixel values between 0 and 1
        x /= 255.
        # Scale pixel values between -1 and 1, sample-wise
        x = 2 * x - 1
        return x

    if mode == 'torch':
        x /= 255.
        mean = [0.485, 0.456, 0.406]
        std = [0.229, 0.224, 0.225]
    else:
        if data_format == 'channels_first':
            # 'RGB'->'BGR'
            if x.ndim == 3:
                x = x[::-1, ...]
            else:
                x = x[:, ::-1, ...]
        else:
            # 'RGB'->'BGR'
            x = x[..., ::-1]
        mean = [103.939, 116.779, 123.68]
        std = None

    # Zero-center by mean pixel
    if data_format == 'channels_first':
        if x.ndim == 3:
            x[0, :, :] -= mean[0]
            x[1, :, :] -= mean[1]
            x[2, :, :] -= mean[2]
            if std is not None:
                x[0, :, :] /= std[0]
                x[1, :, :] /= std[1]
                x[2, :, :] /= std[2]
        else:
            x[:, 0, :, :] -= mean[0]
            x[:, 1, :, :] -= mean[1]
            x[:, 2, :, :] -= mean[2]
            if std is not None:
                x[:, 0, :, :] /= std[0]
                x[:, 1, :, :] /= std[1]
                x[:, 2, :, :] /= std[2]
    else:
        x[..., 0] -= mean[0]
        x[..., 1] -= mean[1]
        x[..., 2] -= mean[2]
        if std is not None:
            x[..., 0] /= std[0]
            x[..., 1] /= std[1]
            x[..., 2] /= std[2]
    return x
```

With this corrected function, the 'tf' mode will correctly scale the pixel values between -1 and 1, fulfilling the expected behavior and passing the failing tests.
