### Bug Analysis:
The bug in the `_preprocess_numpy_input` function arises from incorrect handling of the input image array based on the specified `mode`. When `mode` is set to `'caffe'`, the function is expected to convert RGB images to BGR, but in the current implementation, this is not handled properly. This leads to the erroneous output.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Modify the function to correctly handle the conversion from RGB to BGR when `mode='caffe'`.
2. Ensure the pixel values are zero-centered with respect to the ImageNet dataset.

### Bug Fix - Corrected Version of the Function:

```python
def _preprocess_numpy_input(x, data_format, mode):
    if mode == 'tf':
        x /= 127.5
        x -= 1.
        return x

    if mode == 'torch':
        x /= 255.
        mean = [0.485, 0.456, 0.406]
        std = [0.229, 0.224, 0.225]
    elif mode == 'caffe':
        if data_format == 'channels_first':
            # 'RGB'->'BGR'
            x = x[:, ::-1, ...]
        else:
            # 'RGB'->'BGR'
            x = x[..., ::-1]
        mean = [103.939, 116.779, 123.68]
        std = None

    # Zero-center by mean pixel
    if std is None:
        x -= mean
    else:
        x -= mean
        x /= std
    return x
```

This corrected version of the function ensures that when `mode` is set to `'caffe'`, the RGB to BGR conversion is handled correctly, along with zero-centering the color channels. This modification should address the bug and make the function behave as expected as per the provided test cases.
