### Bug Explanation
The bug in the `_preprocess_numpy_input` function arises from incorrect handling of the `data_format` and `mode` parameters. The function does not properly adjust the input array `x` based on the provided `mode`. Additionally, the function fails to correctly handle different `data_format` specifications, resulting in incorrect preprocessing.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to modify the function to appropriately preprocess the input array `x` based on the specified `mode` and `data_format`. Ensure that the RGB to BGR conversion is correctly applied, mean subtraction, and channel normalization are correctly performed based on the provided `mode`. Additionally, account for the `data_format` to correctly handle channel ordering.

### Corrected Function
```python
import numpy as np

def _preprocess_numpy_input(x, data_format, mode):
    """Preprocesses a Numpy array encoding a batch of images.

    # Arguments
        x: Input array, 3D or 4D.
        data_format: Data format of the image array.
        mode: One of "caffe", "tf" or "torch".
            - caffe: will convert the images from RGB to BGR,
                then will zero-center each color channel with
                respect to the ImageNet dataset,
                without scaling.
            - tf: will scale pixels between -1 and 1,
                sample-wise.
            - torch: will scale pixels between 0 and 1 and then
                will normalize each channel with respect to the
                ImageNet dataset.

    # Returns
        Preprocessed Numpy array.
    """
    if mode == 'tf':
        x /= 127.5
        x -= 1.
    elif mode == 'torch':
        x /= 255.
        mean = np.array([0.485, 0.456, 0.406])
        std = np.array([0.229, 0.224, 0.225])
        x -= mean
        x /= std
    else:
        # Caffe mode or default (fallback to Caffe for unknown mode)
        if data_format == 'channels_first':
            # 'RGB'->'BGR'
            if x.ndim == 3:
                x = x[:, ::-1, ...]
            else:
                x = x[:, :, ::-1, :]
        else:
            # 'RGB'->'BGR'
            x = x[..., ::-1]
        mean = np.array([103.939, 116.779, 123.68])
        x -= mean

    return x
```

By modifying the function as shown above, the corrected version should now properly preprocess the input arrays based on the provided `mode` and `data_format`, aligning with the expected behavior as outlined in the failing test cases.
