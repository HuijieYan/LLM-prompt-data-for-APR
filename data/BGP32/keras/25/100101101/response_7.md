## Bug Explanation
The bug in the `_preprocess_numpy_input` function arises from an incorrect handling of the channel order transformation for different data formats. When the mode is not 'tf' or 'torch', the function attempts to convert 'RGB' to 'BGR', but the channel reversal logic is incorrect. This results in incorrect preprocessing and causes the failing tests.

## Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to correct the logic for channel reversal when the data format is 'channels_first'. We should properly reverse the channels from 'RGB' to 'BGR' in that case. Additionally, we need to ensure that the mean and standard deviation values are applied correctly during preprocessing.

## Bug Fix and Corrected Version

```python
import numpy as np

def _preprocess_numpy_input(x, data_format, mode):
    """Preprocesses a Numpy array encoding a batch of images.

    # Arguments
        x: Input array, 3D or 4D.
        data_format: Data format of the image array.
        mode: One of "caffe", "tf" or "torch".
            - caffe: will convert the images from RGB to BGR,
                then will zero-center each color channel with
                respect to the ImageNet dataset,
                without scaling.
            - tf: will scale pixels between -1 and 1,
                sample-wise.
            - torch: will scale pixels between 0 and 1 and then
                will normalize each channel with respect to the
                ImageNet dataset.

    # Returns
        Preprocessed Numpy array.
    """
    if mode == 'tf':
        x /= 127.5
        x -= 1.
        return x

    if mode == 'torch':
        x /= 255.
        mean = np.array([0.485, 0.456, 0.406])
        std = np.array([0.229, 0.224, 0.225])
    else:
        if data_format == 'channels_first':
            # 'RGB'->'BGR'
            if x.ndim == 3:
                x[0] = x[0][::-1]
                x[1] = x[1][::-1]
                x[2] = x[2][::-1]
            else:
                x[:, 0] = x[:, 0][::-1]
                x[:, 1] = x[:, 1][::-1]
                x[:, 2] = x[:, 2][::-1]
        else:
            # 'RGB'->'BGR'
            x = x[..., ::-1]
        mean = np.array([103.939, 116.779, 123.68])
        std = None

    # Zero-center by mean pixel
    x -= mean
    if std is not None:
        x /= std

    return x
``` 

By correcting the channel reversal logic when the data format is 'channels_first' and applying the mean and standard deviation properly, the function should now preprocess the input correctly and pass the failing tests.
