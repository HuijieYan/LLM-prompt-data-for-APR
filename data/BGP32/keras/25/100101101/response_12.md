### Bug Explanation
The bug lies in the `_preprocess_numpy_input` function where the calculation for zero-centering the input array is incorrect in the 'caffe' mode. The bug specifically affects the channel order manipulation. When the mode is 'caffe', the function incorrectly subtracts the mean from the input array but does not perform the RGB to BGR channel conversion as described. This results in incorrect output values when compared to the expected values.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to first properly convert the RGB input to BGR format when the mode is 'caffe' and then perform the zero-centering and normalization operations as required. This will ensure that the function behaves as intended based on the specified mode.

### Corrected Function
I have corrected the issue in the `_preprocess_numpy_input` function below:

```python
def _preprocess_numpy_input(x, data_format, mode):
    if mode == 'tf':
        x /= 127.5
        x -= 1.
        return x

    if mode == 'torch':
        x /= 255.
        mean = [0.485, 0.456, 0.406]
        std = [0.229, 0.224, 0.225]
    elif mode == 'caffe':
        if data_format == 'channels_first':
            # 'RGB'->'BGR', as expected in 'caffe' mode
            if x.ndim == 3:
                x = x[::-1, ...]
            else:
                x = x[:, ::-1, ...]
        else:
            # 'RGB'->'BGR', as expected in 'caffe' mode
            x = x[..., ::-1]
        mean = [103.939, 116.779, 123.68]
        std = None
    else:
        mean = [103.939, 116.779, 123.68]
        std = None

    # Zero-center by mean pixel
    if data_format == 'channels_first':
        if x.ndim == 3:
            x[0, :, :] -= mean[0]
            x[1, :, :] -= mean[1]
            x[2, :, :] -= mean[2]
            if std is not None:
                x[0, :, :] /= std[0]
                x[1, :, :] /= std[1]
                x[2, :, :] /= std[2]
        else:
            x[:, 0, :, :] -= mean[0]
            x[:, 1, :, :] -= mean[1]
            x[:, 2, :, :] -= mean[2]
            if std is not None:
                x[:, 0, :, :] /= std[0]
                x[:, 1, :, :] /= std[1]
                x[:, 2, :, :] /= std[2]
    else:
        x[..., 0] -= mean[0]
        x[..., 1] -= mean[1]
        x[..., 2] -= mean[2]
        if std is not None:
            x[..., 0] /= std[0]
            x[..., 1] /= std[1]
            x[..., 2] /= std[2]
    return x
```

By updating the function in this way, the `_preprocess_numpy_input` function correctly converts RGB to BGR when in 'caffe' mode, ensuring that the output aligns with the expected values provided in the failing tests.
