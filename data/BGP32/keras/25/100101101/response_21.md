### Bug Explanation
The bug in the `_preprocess_numpy_input` function occurs when the mode is not 'tf' or 'torch'. In such cases, the function incorrectly calculates the mean and adjusts the pixel values based on the given mean. The issue lies in the calculations performed on the input array `x` where the mean values are subtracted from the pixels.

The buggy function fails to correctly preprocess the input array `x` when the mode is not 'tf' or 'torch', leading to incorrect pixel values after preprocessing.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to correctly preprocess the input array `x` based on the `mode` and `data_format` provided. For modes other than 'tf' or 'torch', we need to handle the preprocessing steps that involve mean subtraction and channel reordering correctly. Additionally, we must ensure that the calculations are carried out based on the correct data format (channels_first or channels_last).

### Corrected Function
Below is the corrected version of the `_preprocess_numpy_input` function:

```python
def _preprocess_numpy_input(x, data_format, mode):
    if mode == 'tf':
        x /= 127.5
        x -= 1.
        return x

    if mode == 'torch':
        x /= 255.
        mean = [0.485, 0.456, 0.406]
        std = [0.229, 0.224, 0.225]

    else:
        mean = [103.939, 116.779, 123.68]
        # Handle channel reordering based on data format
        if data_format == 'channels_first':
            x[:, 0, :, :] -= mean[0]
            x[:, 1, :, :] -= mean[1]
            x[:, 2, :, :] -= mean[2]
            if std is not None:
                x[:, 0, :, :] /= std[0]
                x[:, 1, :, :] /= std[1]
                x[:, 2, :, :] /= std[2]
        else:  # 'channels_last'
            x[..., 0] -= mean[0]
            x[..., 1] -= mean[1]
            x[..., 2] -= mean[2]
            if std is not None:
                x[..., 0] /= std[0]
                x[..., 1] /= std[1]
                x[..., 2] /= std[2]

    return x
```

This corrected version should now properly preprocess the input array `x` for all modes and data formats, handling mean subtraction and channel reordering correctly.
