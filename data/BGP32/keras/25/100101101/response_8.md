The bug in the `_preprocess_numpy_input` function lies in the calculation of the preprocessed Numpy array based on the given `mode`. The bug causes incorrect preprocessing of the input array, leading to failing tests.

The bug is specifically caused by the incorrect handling of the `mode` parameter. The function only considers the `mode` values of `'tf'` and `'torch'` to perform the preprocessing, neglecting the condition for `'caffe'`.

To fix the bug, we need to incorporate the correct preprocessing steps for the `'caffe'` mode. For the `'caffe'` mode, the images should be converted from RGB to BGR and then each color channel should be zero-centered with respect to the ImageNet dataset without scaling.

Here is the corrected version of the `_preprocess_numpy_input` function:

```python
def _preprocess_numpy_input(x, data_format, mode):
    """Preprocesses a Numpy array encoding a batch of images.

    # Arguments
        x: Input array, 3D or 4D.
        data_format: Data format of the image array.
        mode: One of "caffe", "tf" or "torch".
            - caffe: will convert the images from RGB to BGR,
                then will zero-center each color channel with
                respect to the ImageNet dataset,
                without scaling.
            - tf: will scale pixels between -1 and 1,
                sample-wise.
            - torch: will scale pixels between 0 and 1 and then
                will normalize each channel with respect to the
                ImageNet dataset.

    # Returns
        Preprocessed Numpy array.
    """
    if mode == 'tf':
        x /= 127.5
        x -= 1.
        return x

    if mode == 'torch':
        x /= 255.
        mean = [0.485, 0.456, 0.406]
        std = [0.229, 0.224, 0.225]
        x = (x - mean) / std
        return x

    if mode == 'caffe':
        if data_format == 'channels_first':
            x[:, 0, :, :] -= 123.68  # Subtract mean for channel 1 (B)
            x[:, 1, :, :] -= 116.779  # Subtract mean for channel 2 (G)
            x[:, 2, :, :] -= 103.939  # Subtract mean for channel 3 (R)
        else:
            x[..., 0] -= 123.68  # Subtract mean for channel 1 (B)
            x[..., 1] -= 116.779  # Subtract mean for channel 2 (G)
            x[..., 2] -= 103.939  # Subtract mean for channel 3 (R)
        return x
```

This corrected version incorporates the necessary preprocessing steps for the `'caffe'` mode, ensuring that the input array is correctly preprocessed for the given `mode`.
