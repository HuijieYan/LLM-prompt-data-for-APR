### Issue:
The issue in the `_preprocess_numpy_input` function lies within the calculation of the preprocessed image array based on the `mode`. The function does not process the input correctly for the 'caffe' mode when the data format is 'channels_last'. This leads to incorrect normalization and zero-centering of the input array, causing the failing tests.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug in the `_preprocess_numpy_input` function, we need to adjust the calculations for zero-centering and normalization based on the provided input parameters `mode`, `data_format`, and the required processing steps for each mode.

### Corrected Function:
Here is the corrected version of the `_preprocess_numpy_input` function:

```python
def _preprocess_numpy_input(x, data_format, mode):
    """Preprocesses a Numpy array encoding a batch of images.

    # Arguments
        x: Input array, 3D or 4D.
        data_format: Data format of the image array.
        mode: One of "caffe", "tf" or "torch".
            - caffe: will convert the images from RGB to BGR,
                then will zero-center each color channel with
                respect to the ImageNet dataset,
                without scaling.
            - tf: will scale pixels between -1 and 1,
                sample-wise.
            - torch: will scale pixels between 0 and 1 and then
                will normalize each channel with respect to the
                ImageNet dataset.

    # Returns
        Preprocessed Numpy array.
    """
    if mode == 'tf':
        x /= 127.5
        x -= 1.
        return x

    if mode == 'torch':
        x /= 255.
        mean = [0.485, 0.456, 0.406]
        std = [0.229, 0.224, 0.225]
    else:
        if data_format == 'channels_first':
            # 'RGB'->'BGR'
            x = x[:, ::-1, ...]
        else:
            # 'RGB'->'BGR'
            x = x[..., ::-1]
        
        mean = [103.939, 116.779, 123.68]
        std = None

    # Zero-center by mean pixel and optional standardization
    x -= mean
    if std is not None:
        x /= std

    return x
```

By making the adjustments above, the `_preprocess_numpy_input` function should now correctly preprocess the input array based on the provided `mode` and `data_format`, passing the failing tests and producing the expected output values.
