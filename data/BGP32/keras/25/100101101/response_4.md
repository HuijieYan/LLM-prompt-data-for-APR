### Bug Analysis:
The bug in the `_preprocess_numpy_input` function lies in the calculation of preprocessing values based on the `mode` and `data_format` parameters provided. The calculations for `mode='caffe'` and `data_format='channels_first'` scenarios are not handled correctly, leading to incorrect preprocessing steps and failing the test cases.

### Bug Explanation:
1. In the `mode == 'torch'` block, the `mean` and `std` values are correctly set and updated. However, for other modes like `'caffe'`, the RGB to BGR conversion is not correctly implemented for images in `channels_first` format.
2. For `data_format=='channels_first'`, the function attempts to convert RGB to BGR, but the logic is flawed, leading to incorrect values.
3. Since the incorrect preprocessing values are applied, the resulting values do not match the expected values from the test cases, leading to failures.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the RGB to BGR conversion and mean subtraction are correctly applied for both `'channels_last'` and `'channels_first'` formats. We also need to handle the scaling and normalization steps properly based on the `mode` provided in the function.

### Corrected Function:
Below is the corrected version of the `_preprocess_numpy_input` function after fixing the bug:

```python
import numpy as np

def _preprocess_numpy_input(x, data_format, mode):
    if mode == 'tf':
        x /= 127.5
        x -= 1.
        return x

    if mode == 'torch':
        x /= 255.
        mean = [0.485, 0.456, 0.406]
        std = [0.229, 0.224, 0.225]
    else:
        mean = [103.939, 116.779, 123.68]
        if data_format == 'channels_first':
            # 'RGB'->'BGR'
            if x.ndim == 3:
                x[0] -= mean[2]
                x[1] -= mean[1]
                x[2] -= mean[0]
            else:
                x[:, 0] -= mean[2]
                x[:, 1] -= mean[1]
                x[:, 2] -= mean[0]
        else:
            # 'RGB'->'BGR'
            x[..., 0] -= mean[2]
            x[..., 1] -= mean[1]
            x[..., 2] -= mean[0]

        if mode != 'torch':
            # Normalize with respect to ImageNet dataset
            x[..., 0] /= 255.0
            x[..., 1] /= 255.0
            x[..., 2] /= 255.0

    return x
```

By making the corrections as described above, the function should now correctly preprocess the input arrays based on the provided `mode` and `data_format`, ensuring the test cases pass as expected.
