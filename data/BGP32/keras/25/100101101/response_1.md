### Bug Explanation
The bug in the `_preprocess_numpy_input` function arises from the fact that when the `mode` is not 'tf' or 'torch', the function does not handle the data format properly for channels_first. It incorrectly calculates the mean subtraction and division for the channels in this case. This results in incorrect preprocessing of the input array, leading to failing tests.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to correctly handle the data format for the 'channels_first' case. Specifically, we need to properly subtract the mean values and divide by standard deviation values per channel. We also need to account for the fact that the input array can have different dimensions and shapes.

### Corrected Function
```python
def _preprocess_numpy_input(x, data_format, mode):
    """Preprocesses a Numpy array encoding a batch of images.

    # Arguments
        x: Input array, 3D or 4D.
        data_format: Data format of the image array.
        mode: One of "caffe", "tf" or "torch".
            - caffe: will convert the images from RGB to BGR,
                then will zero-center each color channel with
                respect to the ImageNet dataset,
                without scaling.
            - tf: will scale pixels between -1 and 1,
                sample-wise.
            - torch: will scale pixels between 0 and 1 and then
                will normalize each channel with respect to the
                ImageNet dataset.

    # Returns
        Preprocessed Numpy array.
    """
    if mode == 'tf':
        x /= 127.5
        x -= 1.
        return x

    if mode == 'torch':
        x /= 255.
        mean = [0.485, 0.456, 0.406]
        std = [0.229, 0.224, 0.225]
    else:
        if data_format == 'channels_first':
            # 'RGB'->'BGR'
            mean = [103.939, 116.779, 123.68]
            std = None
        else:
            # 'RGB'->'BGR'
            mean = [103.939, 116.779, 123.68][::-1]
            std = None

    # Zero-center by mean pixel
    if data_format == 'channels_first':
        for i in range(x.shape[1]):
            for channel in range(3):
                x[:, channel, :, :] -= mean[channel]
                if std is not None:
                    x[:, channel, :, :] /= std[channel]
    else:
        for channel in range(3):
            x[..., channel] -= mean[channel]
            if std is not None:
                x[..., channel] /= std[channel]

    return x
```

By updating the `_preprocess_numpy_input` function as described above, the corrected function should now properly handle the channels_first data format and perform the mean subtraction and division by standard deviation calculations correctly. This should address the bug and ensure that the failing tests pass successfully.
