The bug in the `_preprocess_numpy_input` function lies in the calculation of pixel values based on the `mean` and `std` arrays. The issue is that if the `mode` is not 'tf' or 'torch', the function should apply transformations based on whether the `data_format` is 'channels_first' or 'channels_last'. However, the mean subtraction and normalization calculations are incorrect in the else block.

To fix this bug, we need to correctly calculate the mean-subtraction and normalization based on the data format. Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _preprocess_numpy_input(x, data_format, mode):
    if mode == 'tf':
        x /= 127.5
        x -= 1.
        return x

    if mode == 'torch':
        x /= 255.
        mean = [0.485, 0.456, 0.406]
        std = [0.229, 0.224, 0.225]
    else:
        if data_format == 'channels_first':
            if x.ndim == 3:
                x -= np.array([103.939, 116.779, 123.68]).reshape((3, 1, 1))
                x /= np.array([255.0, 255.0, 255.0]).reshape((3, 1, 1))
            else:
                x -= np.array([103.939, 116.779, 123.68])
                x /= np.array([255.0, 255.0, 255.0])
        else:
            x -= np.array([103.939, 116.779, 123.68])
            x /= np.array([255.0, 255.0, 255.0])

    return x
```

This corrected version correctly handles the mean subtraction and normalization based on the `data_format` when the `mode` is not 'tf' or 'torch'. This should address the issue and make the function pass the failing tests.
