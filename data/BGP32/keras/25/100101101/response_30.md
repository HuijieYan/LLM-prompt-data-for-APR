The bug in the `_preprocess_numpy_input` function is related to the calculation of the preprocessed input based on the provided `mode` parameter. The issue lies in the handling of the `mode` parameter and the corresponding calculations.

### Bug Explanation:
- For the case where `mode == 'caffe'` or `mode != 'tf' and mode != 'torch'`, the function performs color channel manipulation and normalization based on the 'caffe' mode. However, the calculation is incorrect when processing images in 'channels_first' format, resulting in incorrect color channel normalization and causing the test cases to fail.
- In the 'caffe' mode case, the RGB to BGR conversion is done correctly but the mean subtraction and optional standard deviation division according to the ImageNet dataset are miscalculated, especially when the data format is 'channels_first'.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Correct the mean subtraction for each channel in 'channels_first' format to match the ImageNet dataset specifics.
2. Ensure that the standard deviation division is calculated correctly if provided when the data format is 'channels_first'.
3. Consolidate the conditional checks for `mode` and `data_format` to handle all possible combinations correctly.

### Corrected Function:
```python
def _preprocess_numpy_input(x, data_format, mode):
    if mode == 'tf':
        x /= 127.5
        x -= 1.
        return x

    if mode == 'torch':
        x /= 255.
        mean = [0.485, 0.456, 0.406]
        std = [0.229, 0.224, 0.225]
    else:
        # Correct 'RGB' to 'BGR' conversion based on data_format
        if data_format == 'channels_first':
            x = x[:, ::-1, ...]
        else:
            x = x[..., ::-1]
        mean = [103.939, 116.779, 123.68]
        std = None

    # Zero-center by mean pixel and normalize by standard deviation
    if data_format == 'channels_first':
        x[:, 0, :, :] -= mean[0]
        x[:, 1, :, :] -= mean[1]
        x[:, 2, :, :] -= mean[2]
        if std is not None:
            x[:, 0, :, :] /= std[0]
            x[:, 1, :, :] /= std[1]
            x[:, 2, :, :] /= std[2]
    else:
        x[..., 0] -= mean[0]
        x[..., 1] -= mean[1]
        x[..., 2] -= mean[2]
        if std is not None:
            x[..., 0] /= std[0]
            x[..., 1] /= std[1]
            x[..., 2] /= std[2]
    return x
```

By correcting the mean subtraction and handling standard deviation division properly when required, the function should now preprocess the input image arrays correctly according to the specified mode and data format. This corrected version should pass the failing test cases and provide the expected preprocessed outputs.
