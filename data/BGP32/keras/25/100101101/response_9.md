### Bug Explanation:
The bug occurs in the `_preprocess_numpy_input` function due to inconsistent handling of the data_format parameter when the mode is not 'tf' or 'torch'. Specifically, when the mode is not 'tf' or 'torch' and the data_format is 'channels_first', the function incorrectly manipulates the input array, resulting in an incorrect output when attempting to preprocess an image batch.

The issue arises when converting RGB to BGR for 'caffe' mode with 'channels_first' data format. The logic applied is reversing the color channels, which is valid for 'caffe' mode but not correctly defined for 'channels_first' data format.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to modify the logic for converting RGB to BGR when the data_format is 'channels_first' and the mode is not 'tf' or 'torch'. Specifically, we should reverse the color channels as needed for the 'caffe' mode without considering the data format.

### Corrected Function:
Here is the corrected version of the `_preprocess_numpy_input` function:

```python
def _preprocess_numpy_input(x, data_format, mode):
    if mode == 'tf':
        x /= 127.5
        x -= 1.
        return x

    if mode == 'torch':
        x /= 255.
        mean = [0.485, 0.456, 0.406]
        std = [0.229, 0.224, 0.225]
    else:
        # Always convert 'RGB' to 'BGR'
        x = x[..., ::-1]
        mean = [103.939, 116.779, 123.68]
        std = None

    # Zero-center by mean pixel
    if data_format == 'channels_first':
        x -= mean
        if std is not None:
            x /= std
    else:
        x -= mean
        if std is not None:
            x /= std

    return x
```

By making the above changes, we ensure that the color channel reversal is performed correctly for the 'channels_first' data format in the 'caffe' mode, leading to the correct preprocessing of the input array.
