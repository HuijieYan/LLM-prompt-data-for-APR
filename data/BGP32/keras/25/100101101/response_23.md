### Bug Explanation:
The bug occurs in the `_preprocess_numpy_input` function when the `mode` is not 'tf' or 'torch'. In this case, it attempts to apply preprocessing based on the `data_format` but encounters an issue with handling the dimensions of the input array.

When `mode` is not 'tf' or 'torch' and `data_format` is 'channels_first', the function incorrectly handles the array dimensions and modifies the data incorrectly, leading to a mismatch with the expected output.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the preprocessing for 'caffe' mode and 'channels_first' data format is correctly implemented for both 3D and 4D arrays. This involves properly rearranging the array dimensions and performing the required mean subtraction.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def _preprocess_numpy_input(x, data_format, mode):
    """Preprocesses a Numpy array encoding a batch of images.

    # Arguments
        x: Input array, 3D or 4D.
        data_format: Data format of the image array.
        mode: One of "caffe", "tf" or "torch".
            - caffe: will convert the images from RGB to BGR,
                then will zero-center each color channel with
                respect to the ImageNet dataset,
                without scaling.
            - tf: will scale pixels between -1 and 1,
                sample-wise.
            - torch: will scale pixels between 0 and 1 and then
                will normalize each channel with respect to the
                ImageNet dataset.

    # Returns
        Preprocessed Numpy array.
    """
    if mode == 'tf':
        x /= 127.5
        x -= 1.
        return x

    if mode == 'torch':
        x /= 255.
        mean = [0.485, 0.456, 0.406]
        std = [0.229, 0.224, 0.225]
    else:
        # Default for mode 'caffe'
        mean = [103.939, 116.779, 123.68]
        std = None

    if data_format == 'channels_first':
        x = np.moveaxis(x, -1, 1)  # move channel axis to the second position
        x[:, 0, :, :] -= mean[0]
        x[:, 1, :, :] -= mean[1]
        x[:, 2, :, :] -= mean[2]
        if std is not None:
            x[:, 0, :, :] /= std[0]
            x[:, 1, :, :] /= std[1]
            x[:, 2, :, :] /= std[2]
    else:
        # Default for data_format 'channels_last'
        x = x[..., ::-1]  # Convert 'RGB' to 'BGR' by reversing the channels
        x[..., 0] -= mean[0]
        x[..., 1] -= mean[1]
        x[..., 2] -= mean[2]
        if std is not None:
            x[..., 0] /= std[0]
            x[..., 1] /= std[1]
            x[..., 2] /= std[2]

    return x
```

By rearranging the dimensions correctly and applying the mean subtraction according to the data format, this corrected version of the function should now pass the failing tests and produce the expected output.
