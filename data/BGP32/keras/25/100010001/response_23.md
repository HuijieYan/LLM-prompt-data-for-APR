### Analysis:
1. The error message indicates that there is an issue with casting the output of the subtraction operation from `float64` to `int32`.
2. The function `_preprocess_numpy_input` preprocesses a Numpy array encoding a batch of images based on the `mode` and `data_format` parameters.
3. The bug occurs when the subtraction operation `x[..., 0] -= mean[0]` is performed using an integer input `xint`.
4. Since `xint` has a `dtype` of `int32`, the operation results in an error when trying to subtract a `float64` value from an `int32`.
5. A strategy to fix this bug is to ensure that the input array `x` is converted to a floating-point type to avoid data type casting issues.

### Code Correction:

    """Preprocesses a Numpy array encoding a batch of images.

    # Arguments
        x: Input array, 3D or 4D.
        data_format: Data format of the image array.
        mode: One of "caffe", "tf" or "torch".
            - caffe: will convert the images from RGB to BGR,
                then will zero-center each color channel with
                respect to the ImageNet dataset,
                without scaling.
            - tf: will scale pixels between -1 and 1,
                sample-wise.
            - torch: will scale pixels between 0 and 1 and then
                will normalize each channel with respect to the
                ImageNet dataset.

By converting the input array `x` to `float32` at the beginning of the function, we ensure that all subsequent operations maintain consistency in data type. Also, the corrected version of the function should now pass the failing test case provided.
