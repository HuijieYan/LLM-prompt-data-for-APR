### Analysis:
The error message indicates a casting issue related to the subtraction operation within the `_preprocess_numpy_input` function. It suggests that the output of the subtraction operation (`x[..., 0] -= mean[0]`) is attempting to be cast from `float64` to `int32`, which is not allowed due to different data types.

### Issue:
The bug is causing a casting error due to the inconsistent data types while performing subtraction on the input Numpy array (`x`) with the mean pixel values.

### Strategy for fixing the bug:
1. Ensure consistency in data types to avoid casting errors.
2. Avoid operations that may result in type mismatches.
3. Use explicit data type conversion when necessary to maintain data type consistency.

### Updated/Coprrcted Function:
```python
def _preprocess_numpy_input(x, data_format, mode):
    if mode == 'tf':
        x = x / 127.5 - 1.  # Convert to float operation rather than in-place division and subtraction
        return x.astype(np.float32)  # Make sure the output is in the same consistent data type

    if mode == 'torch':
        x = x / 255.
        mean = np.array([0.485, 0.456, 0.406])
        std = np.array([0.229, 0.224, 0.225])
    else:
        if data_format == 'channels_first':
            if x.ndim == 3:
                x = x[::-1, ...].astype(np.float32)  # Convert to float32 as needed
            else:
                x = x[:, ::-1, ...].astype(np.float32)  # Convert to float32 as needed
        else:
            x = x[..., ::-1].astype(np.float32)  # Convert to float32 as needed
        mean = np.array([103.939, 116.779, 123.68])
        std = None

    if std is not None:
        x -= mean
        x /= std
    else:
        x -= mean

    return x
```

### Explanation:
1. The corrected function performs division and subtraction operations explicitly to avoid type mismatches.
2. It ensures that the output is consistently in `float32` data type where necessary.
3. In cases where division by `std` is needed, it performs the operation with consistent data types.
