### Analysis:
- The error message points to the line `x[..., 0] -= mean[0]` in the `_preprocess_numpy_input` function as the source of the error.
- The error is a `UFuncTypeError` which indicates a casting issue between `float64` and `int32` types when performing the subtraction operation.

### Bug Cause:
- In the case where `mode` is not 'tf' or 'torch', the mean values are subtracted from the input array `x`. This operation requires consistent data types in order to perform the subtraction without error.
- The mean values are provided as floats (`float64`), while the input array `x` might be integer type (`int32`).
- This inconsistency leads to the casting error when trying to subtract a float value from an integer value in the numpy array.

### Bug Fix:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the mean values are cast to the same data type as the input array before performing the subtraction operation. 

### Corrected Function:
```python
import numpy as np

def _preprocess_numpy_input(x, data_format, mode):
    """Preprocesses a Numpy array encoding a batch of images.

    # Arguments
        x: Input array, 3D or 4D.
        data_format: Data format of the image array.
        mode: One of "caffe", "tf" or "torch".
            - caffe: will convert the images from RGB to BGR,
                then will zero-center each color channel with
                respect to the ImageNet dataset,
                without scaling.
            - tf: will scale pixels between -1 and 1,
                sample-wise.
            - torch: will scale pixels between 0 and 1 and then
                will normalize each channel with respect to the
                ImageNet dataset.

    # Returns
        Preprocessed Numpy array.

In the corrected function, `mean` and `std` arrays are cast to the same data type as the input `x` array before performing operations on them, ensuring consistency in data types.
