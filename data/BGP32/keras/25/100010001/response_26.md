### Analysis:
The error message indicates that there is a type casting issue where the output from the subtract operation cannot be cast from dtype('float64') to dtype('int32'). This error occurs on line 82 when trying to operate on `x[..., 0] -= mean[0]` with `x` being of type int32 and `mean[0]` being a float.

### Potential Error Locations:
- The calculation operations on `x` might lead to type casting issues.
- Inequalities in dimensions handling for `x`.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is caused by performing arithmetic operations on numpy arrays with different data types without explicitly handling the type conversion, resulting in a type casting error while trying to subtract a float value from an int32 array.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that all operations are performed with the correct data types. In this case, we need to ensure that the result of operations is of the correct data type. Explicit conversions should be done if needed to prevent type casting errors.

### Corrected Version:
Here is the corrected version of the `_preprocess_numpy_input` function:

```python
def _preprocess_numpy_input(x, data_format, mode):
    if mode == 'tf':
        x = x.astype('float64')   # Convert to float before calculations
        x /= 127.5
        x -= 1.
        return x

    if mode == 'torch':
        x = x.astype('float64')   # Convert to float before calculations
        x /= 255.
        mean = [0.485, 0.456, 0.406]
        std = [0.229, 0.224, 0.225]
    else:
        x = x.astype('float64')   # Convert to float before calculations
        if data_format == 'channels_first':
            if x.ndim == 3:
                x = x[::-1, ...]
            else:
                x = x[:, ::-1, ...]
        else:
            x = x[..., ::-1]
        mean = [103.939, 116.779, 123.68]
        std = None

    if data_format == 'channels_first':
        if x.ndim == 3:
            x[0, :, :] -= mean[0]
            x[1, :, :] -= mean[1]
            x[2, :, :] -= mean[2]
            if std is not None:
                x[0, :, :] /= std[0]
                x[1, :, :] /= std[1]
                x[2, :, :] /= std[2]
        else:
            x[:, 0, :, :] -= mean[0]
            x[:, 1, :, :] -= mean[1]
            x[:, 2, :, :] -= mean[2]
            if std is not None:
                x[:, 0, :, :] /= std[0]
                x[:, 1, :, :] /= std[1]
                x[:, 2, :, :] /= std[2]
    else:
        x[..., 0] -= mean[0]
        x[..., 1] -= mean[1]
        x[..., 2] -= mean[2]
        if std is not None:
            x[..., 0] /= std[0]
            x[..., 1] /= std[1]
            x[..., 2] /= std[2]
    return x
```

By explicitly converting `x` to float before calculations and ensuring that all operations maintain the correct data types, we can prevent the type casting error and fix the bug.
