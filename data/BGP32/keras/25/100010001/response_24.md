### Analysis:
- The error message indicates that there is a `UFuncTypeError` due to attempting to cast the result of the subtraction operation from `float64` to `int32`, which is not allowed.
- The bug is likely located in the calculation of `mean` values and subsequent subtraction in the `else` block of the function, where the `mode` is neither 'tf' nor 'torch'.
- The issue arises from subtracting the `mean` values (float) from the input array `x`, which is an array of type `int32`.

### Bug Cause:
- The bug in this function is causing an error due to the attempted subtraction of the float values in `mean` from an array of type `int32`.

### Fix Strategy:
- To fix the bug, ensure that the input array `x` is cast to a floating-point type before performing the subtraction to avoid any type casting issues and ensure numerical consistency.

### Corrected Version:
```python
import numpy as np

def _preprocess_numpy_input(x, data_format, mode):
    if mode == 'tf':
        x = x.astype(np.float32)
        x /= 127.5
        x -= 1.
        return x

    if mode == 'torch':
        x = x.astype(np.float32)
        x /= 255.
        mean = [0.485, 0.456, 0.406]
        std = [0.229, 0.224, 0.225]
    else:
        if data_format == 'channels_first':
            if x.ndim == 3:
                x = x[::-1, ...]
            else:
                x = x[:, ::-1, ...]
        else:
            x = x[..., ::-1]
        mean = [103.939, 116.779, 123.68]
        std = None

    if mode != 'tf':
        x = x.astype(np.float32)  # Cast the input array x to float32 type
        # Zero-center by mean pixel
        if data_format == 'channels_first':
            if x.ndim == 3:
                x[0, :, :] -= mean[0]
                x[1, :, :] -= mean[1]
                x[2, :, :] -= mean[2]
                if std is not None:
                    x[0, :, :] /= std[0]
                    x[1, :, :] /= std[1]
                    x[2, :, :] /= std[2]
            else:
                x[:, 0, :, :] -= mean[0]
                x[:, 1, :, :] -= mean[1]
                x[:, 2, :, :] -= mean[2]
                if std is not None:
                    x[:, 0, :, :] /= std[0]
                    x[:, 1, :, :] /= std[1]
                    x[:, 2, :, :] /= std[2]
        else:
            x[..., 0] -= mean[0]
            x[..., 1] -= mean[1]
            x[..., 2] -= mean[2]
            if std is not None:
                x[..., 0] /= std[0]
                x[..., 1] /= std[1]
                x[..., 2] /= std[2]
    return x
```

After making these corrections, the function should now handle different data types correctly and avoid the UFuncTypeError.
