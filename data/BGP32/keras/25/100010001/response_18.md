### Analysis:
The error message is coming from the attempt to subtract `mean[0]` from `x[..., 0]`, which results in a `UFuncTypeError` because the data type of `x` is 'int32' and we are trying to perform calculations typically done on floating-point numbers. This issue arises when encountering the `mode='torch'` condition.

### Bug:
The bug occurs when trying to perform float-based operations on an array that has an `int` data type. This is happening when the mode is set to 'torch' where the array `x` is expected to be in a floating-point format but is instead passed as integers.

### Fix:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the input array `x` is converted to floating-point values before performing any arithmetic operations. This can be achieved by casting `x` to a floating-point data type before performing any calculations.

### Updated / Corrected Function:
```python
def _preprocess_numpy_input(x, data_format, mode):
    """Preprocesses a Numpy array encoding a batch of images.

    # Arguments
        x: Input array, 3D or 4D.
        data_format: Data format of the image array.
        mode: One of "caffe", "tf" or "torch".
            - caffe: will convert the images from RGB to BGR,
                then will zero-center each color channel with
                respect to the ImageNet dataset,
                without scaling.
            - tf: will scale pixels between -1 and 1,
                sample-wise.
            - torch: will scale pixels between 0 and 1 and then
                will normalize each channel with respect to the
                ImageNet dataset.

    # Returns
        Preprocessed Numpy array.

            x[..., 0] /= std[0]

    return x
```

By converting `x` to a floating-point data type early in the function, we ensure that all subsequent calculations are performed correctly without causing type mismatches.
