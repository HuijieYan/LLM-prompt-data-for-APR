### Analysis:
1. The error message indicates a `UFuncTypeError` caused by trying to subtract a float value from an array of type `int32`.
2. The issue seems to be related to the computation of `mean` values in the `torch` mode, where the array `x` is of type `int32` and the `mean` values are float.
3. This discrepancy in data types causes the error when attempting to perform arithmetic operations.
4. To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the data type of `x` aligns with the data type of the `mean` values before performing the operations.

### Solution:
1. We need to cast array `x` to float before performing the arithmetic operations in the `torch` mode.
2. We can make this adjustment by converting `x` to float at the beginning of the `torch` mode block.
3. This will ensure compatibility of data types when performing operations.
4. After making the necessary corrections, the function should be able to preprocess the input correctly without any data type conflicts.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def _preprocess_numpy_input(x, data_format, mode):
    """Preprocesses a Numpy array encoding a batch of images.

    # Arguments
        x: Input array, 3D or 4D.
        data_format: Data format of the image array.
        mode: One of "caffe", "tf" or "torch".
            - caffe: will convert the images from RGB to BGR,
                then will zero-center each color channel with
                respect to the ImageNet dataset,
                without scaling.
            - tf: will scale pixels between -1 and 1,
                sample-wise.
            - torch: will scale pixels between 0 and 1 and then
                will normalize each channel with respect to the
                ImageNet dataset.

    # Returns
        Preprocessed Numpy array.
    """
    if mode == 'tf':
        x /= 127.5
        x -= 1.
        return x

    if mode == 'torch':
        x = x.astype('float32')  # Cast x to float
        x /= 255.
        mean = [0.485, 0.456, 0.406]
        std = [0.229, 0.224, 0.225]
    else:
        if data_format == 'channels_first':
            # 'RGB'->'BGR'
            if x.ndim == 3:
                x = x[::-1, ...]
            else:
                x = x[:, ::-1, ...]
        else:
            # 'RGB'->'BGR'
            x = x[..., ::-1]
        mean = [103.939, 116.779, 123.68]
        std = None

    # Remaining code remains the same
    ...
```

By making this adjustment and correctly casting `x` to `float32` in the `torch` mode, the function should now be able to preprocess the input data without any data type conflicts and pass the failing test.
