### Analysis:
- The error message states that there is a `UFuncTypeError` raised by a ufunc 'subtract' due to casting issue from `float64` to `int32`.
- This error arises when attempting to subtract a float value from an integer array.

### Bug:
- The bug occurs in the `_preprocess_numpy_input` function on line 82, specifically when trying to perform subtraction operation on the input array `x` with mean values in an integer array `xint`. This causes the data type mismatch issue leading to the `UFuncTypeError`.

### Fix:
- To resolve this bug and prevent the casting error, we should ensure that the data type consistency is maintained throughout the calculations. In this case, we need to make sure that the input array `x` and the mean/std arrays are of the same data type.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def _preprocess_numpy_input(x, data_format, mode):
    if mode == 'tf':
        x = x.astype('float32')  # Convert input to float
        x /= 127.5
        x -= 1.
        return x
    if mode == 'torch':
        x /= 255.
        mean = np.array([0.485, 0.456, 0.406], dtype=x.dtype)  # Set mean/std data type
        std = np.array([0.229, 0.224, 0.225], dtype=x.dtype)
    else:
        if data_format == 'channels_first':
            if x.ndim == 3:
                x = x[::-1, ...]
            else:
                x = x[:, ::-1, ...]
        else:
            x = x[..., ::-1]
        mean = np.array([103.939, 116.779, 123.68], dtype=x.dtype)
        std = None

    if data_format == 'channels_first':
        if x.ndim == 3:
            x[0, :, :] -= mean[0]
            x[1, :, :] -= mean[1]
            x[2, :, :] -= mean[2]
            if std is not None:
                x[0, :, :] /= std[0]
                x[1, :, :] /= std[1]
                x[2, :, :] /= std[2]
        else:
            x[:, 0, :, :] -= mean[0]
            x[:, 1, :, :] -= mean[1]
            x[:, 2, :, :] -= mean[2]
            if std is not None:
                x[:, 0, :, :] /= std[0]
                x[:, 1, :, :] /= std[1]
                x[:, 2, :, :] /= std[2]
    else:
        x[..., 0] -= mean[0]
        x[..., 1] -= mean[1]
        x[..., 2] -= mean[2]
        if std is not None:
            x[..., 0] /= std[0]
            x[..., 1] /= std[1]
            x[..., 2] /= std[2]
    return x
```

Now, with the corrected version, the function should handle different data types appropriately, and the casting error should be resolved making the test pass successfully.
