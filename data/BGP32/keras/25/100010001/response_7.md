### Analysis:
1. The error message indicates a type error related to casting between data types in a NumPy operation. Specifically, the error suggests that the function is trying to subtract a float value (mean) from an array of integers (x).
2. The error occurs at line 82 of the `_preprocess_numpy_input` function in the `keras/applications/imagenet_utils.py` file.
3. The function is intended to preprocess a Numpy array of images based on the data format and mode specified. The incorrect type casting error occurs due to trying to perform arithmetic operations between floats and integers.
4. To fix the bug, we need to ensure that all operations are done with consistent data types. In this case, we need to make sure that both `x` and `mean` are of the same data type before performing arithmetic operations.
   
### Bug Fix:
Here is the corrected version of the `_preprocess_numpy_input` function:

```python
def _preprocess_numpy_input(x, data_format, mode):
    if mode == 'tf':
        x = (x / 127.5) - 1.0
        return x.astype('float32')  # Convert x to float32

    if mode == 'torch':
        x = x / 255.0
        mean = np.array([0.485, 0.456, 0.406], dtype='float32')  
        std = np.array([0.229, 0.224, 0.225], dtype='float32') 
    else:
        x = x.astype('float32')  # Convert x to float32
        if data_format == 'channels_first':
            if x.ndim == 3:
                x = x[::-1, ...]
            else:
                x = x[:, ::-1, ...]
        else:
            x = x[..., ::-1]
        mean = np.array([103.939, 116.779, 123.68], dtype='float32')
        std = None

    if data_format == 'channels_first':
        if x.ndim == 3:
            x[0, :, :] -= mean[0]
            x[1, :, :] -= mean[1]
            x[2, :, :] -= mean[2]
            if std is not None:
                x[0, :, :] /= std[0]
                x[1, :, :] /= std[1]
                x[2, :, :] /= std[2]
        else:
            x[:, 0, :, :] -= mean[0]
            x[:, 1, :, :] -= mean[1]
            x[:, 2, :, :] -= mean[2]
            if std is not None:
                x[:, 0, :, :] /= std[0]
                x[:, 1, :, :] /= std[1]
                x[:, 2, :, :] /= std[2]
    else:
        x[..., 0] -= mean[0]
        x[..., 1] -= mean[1]
        x[..., 2] -= mean[2]
        if std is not None:
            x[..., 0] /= std[0]
            x[..., 1] /= std[1]
            x[..., 2] /= std[2]
    return x
```

In this corrected version:
1. We have explicitly converted the input arrays to `float32` data type where necessary to ensure consistent data types for arithmetic operations.
2. The mean values are casted to `float32` data type for consistency.
3. The operations and data types should now be consistent, addressing the type error indicated in the failing test.
