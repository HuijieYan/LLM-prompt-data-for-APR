### Analysis:
- The error message indicates a `UFuncTypeError` caused by attempting to subtract a float value from an integer array.
- The problematic line is `x[..., 0] -= mean[0]` in the function `_preprocess_numpy_input`.
- The error occurs when the `mode` is not 'tf' or 'torch' which changes the data format to 'channels_first' or 'channels_last', causing the bug.

### Bug:
The bug arises from the fact that when `mode` is neither 'tf' nor 'torch', the function assumes a data format of 'channels_first' or 'channels_last', leading to incorrectly handling the integer values in `x`.

### Fix:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that integer values in `x` are converted to float values when subtracting the mean values. We can achieve this by ensuring that `x` is converted to float before any operations to avoid the mismatch in data types.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def _preprocess_numpy_input(x, data_format, mode):
    """Preprocesses a Numpy array encoding a batch of images.

    # Arguments
        x: Input array, 3D or 4D.
        data_format: Data format of the image array.
        mode: One of "caffe", "tf" or "torch".
            - caffe: will convert the images from RGB to BGR,
                then will zero-center each color channel with
                respect to the ImageNet dataset,
                without scaling.
            - tf: will scale pixels between -1 and 1,
                sample-wise.
            - torch: will scale pixels between 0 and 1 and then
                will normalize each channel with respect to the
                ImageNet dataset.

        Preprocessed Numpy array.

This corrected version ensures that `x` is converted to a float array before performing any arithmetic operations, fixing the issue that caused the bug.
