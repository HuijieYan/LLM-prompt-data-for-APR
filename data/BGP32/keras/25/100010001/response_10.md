### Analysis:
The error message indicates that there is an issue with casting the output of the subtraction operation from `float64` to `int32`, which occurs when using integer input arrays.

1. The bug occurs in the line where subtraction operations are performed on the input array `x` with the mean values.
2. The input `xint` is generated by converting `x` to integer using `x.astype('int32')`.
3. The function `_preprocess_numpy_input` only expects input in float format and is not handling integer inputs properly, causing the casting error.
4. To fix the bug, we need to explicitly convert the input array `x` to float before performing arithmetic operations.

### Bug Fix:
Here is the corrected version of the `_preprocess_numpy_input` function:

```python
def _preprocess_numpy_input(x, data_format, mode):
    if mode == 'tf':
        x = x / 127.5
        x = x - 1.
        return x.astype('float32')  # Ensure output is of type float32
    
    if mode == 'torch':
        x = x / 255.
        mean = np.array([0.485, 0.456, 0.406])
        std = np.array([0.229, 0.224, 0.225])
    else:
        x = x.astype('float32')  # Ensure input is of type float32
        if data_format == 'channels_first':
            if x.ndim == 3:
                x[0, :, :] -= mean[0]
                x[1, :, :] -= mean[1]
                x[2, :, :] -= mean[2]
                if std is not None:
                    x[0, :, :] /= std[0]
                    x[1, :, :] /= std[1]
                    x[2, :, :] /= std[2]
            else:
                x[:, 0, :, :] -= mean[0]
                x[:, 1, :, :] -= mean[1]
                x[:, 2, :, :] -= mean[2]
                if std is not None:
                    x[:, 0, :, :] /= std[0]
                    x[:, 1, :, :] /= std[1]
                    x[:, 2, :, :] /= std[2]
        else:
            x -= mean
            if std is not None:
                x /= std
    return x
```

By explicitly converting the input arrays to float using `astype('float32')`, the bug of incorrect casting from float to int is fixed. This updated function should now correctly preprocess both float and int input arrays without causing any casting errors.
