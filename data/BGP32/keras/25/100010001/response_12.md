### Analysis:
- The error message indicates that there is an issue with casting an output from a float dtype to an int32 dtype in the `x[..., 0] -= mean[0]` operation.
- The bug is occurring due to the inconsistent data types between the array `x` (int32) and the mean values which are float64.
- The assignment of mean values to the `mean` variable is based on conditional statements, and the default values are floats.

### Error Cause:
- In modes other than 'tf' and 'torch', the mean values are float64 while subtracting them from the 'int32' array `x`, resulting in the dtype mismatch and triggering the error.

### Fix Strategy:
- To fix this bug, ensure that the mean values are compatible with the dtype of the input array `x` before performing subtraction operations.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def _preprocess_numpy_input(x, data_format, mode):
    """Preprocesses a Numpy array encoding a batch of images.

    # Arguments
        x: Input array, 3D or 4D.
        data_format: Data format of the image array.
        mode: One of "caffe", "tf" or "torch".
            - caffe: will convert the images from RGB to BGR,
                then will zero-center each color channel with
                respect to the ImageNet dataset,
                without scaling.
            - tf: will scale pixels between -1 and 1,
                sample-wise.
            - torch: will scale pixels between 0 and 1 and then
                will normalize each channel with respect to the
                ImageNet dataset.

    # Returns
        Preprocessed Numpy array.

By converting the input array `x` to float32 within the function and ensuring all the variables (`mean` and `std`) are declared as float32, we can fix the casting error and make the function work correctly.
