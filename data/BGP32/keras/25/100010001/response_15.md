### Analysis:
The error message indicates a `UFuncTypeError` which states that there is an issue with the data types involved in the mathematical operation being performed. Specifically, it mentions that it cannot cast the output of a subtraction operation from a float to an int32.

### Bug:
The bug in the `_preprocess_numpy_input` function arises when the input `x` is an integer array but the calculations being performed within the function are expecting floating-point values, leading to a data type conflict.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To resolve the bug, we need to ensure that the input `x` is converted to float before performing any mathematical operations. This will ensure that the calculations are done with floating-point precision and avoid data type conflicts.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def _preprocess_numpy_input(x, data_format, mode):
    """Preprocesses a Numpy array encoding a batch of images.

    # Arguments
        x: Input array, 3D or 4D.
        data_format: Data format of the image array.
        mode: One of "caffe", "tf" or "torch".
            - caffe: will convert the images from RGB to BGR,
                then will zero-center each color channel with
                respect to the ImageNet dataset,
                without scaling.
            - tf: will scale pixels between -1 and 1,
                sample-wise.
            - torch: will scale pixels between 0 and 1 and then
                will normalize each channel with respect to the
                ImageNet dataset.

    # Returns
        Preprocessed Numpy array.

This correction involves converting the input array `x` to float before performing any calculations. This will ensure compatibility with the mathematical operations within the function and resolve the data type conflict, thus fixing the bug.
