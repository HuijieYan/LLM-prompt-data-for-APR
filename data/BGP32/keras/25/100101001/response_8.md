### Bug Analysis:
The bug seems to be related to the calculations performed when mode is not 'tf' or 'torch'. When mode is not 'tf' or 'torch', the function is supposed to adjust the input array x according to the data_format ('channels_first' or 'channels_last') and convert the color channels from RGB to BGR. However, in the provided implementation, the mean value used to zero-center the image is incorrect when data_format is 'channels_last'.

### Bug Explanation:
1. For the failing test case where data_format is 'channels_last':
    - The input array x is correctly shaped as (2, 10, 10, 3), which represents a batch of images.
    - The input mode is 'caffe'.
    - When processing the input x with 'channels_last' data_format and mode 'caffe', the images should be converted from RGB to BGR. However, the mean values used for zero-centering are set to [103.939, 116.779, 123.68], which are incorrect for 'channels_last' format.

The cause of the bug is incorrect mean values being used for zero-centering images when data_format is 'channels_last' and mode is not 'tf' or 'torch'.

### Bug Fix:
To fix the bug and make the function preprocess the input array correctly for 'channels_last' data_format, we need to update the mean values used for zero-centering.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def _preprocess_numpy_input(x, data_format, mode):
    """Preprocesses a Numpy array encoding a batch of images.

    # Arguments
        x: Input array, 3D or 4D.
        data_format: Data format of the image array.
        mode: One of "caffe", "tf" or "torch".
            - caffe: will convert the images from RGB to BGR,
                then will zero-center each color channel with
                respect to the ImageNet dataset,
                without scaling.
            - tf: will scale pixels between -1 and 1,
                sample-wise.
            - torch: will scale pixels between 0 and 1 and then
                will normalize each channel with respect to the
                ImageNet dataset.

    # Returns
        Preprocessed Numpy array.

    if mode == 'tf':
        x /= 127.5
        x -= 1.
        return x

    if mode == 'torch':
        x /= 255.
        mean = [0.485, 0.456, 0.406]

            x[2, :, :] -= mean[2]
            if std is not None:
                x[0, :, :] /= std[0]
                x[1, :, :] /= std[1]
                x[2, :, :] /= std[2]
        else:

    else:

    return x
```

By updating the mean values used for zero-centering images in 'channels_last' data_format, the corrected version of the function should now preprocess the input array correctly and pass the failing tests.
