### Identify the bug
The bug occurs when the `mode` is not `'tf'` or `'torch'` and `data_format` is `'channels_last'`. In this case, the function is incorrectly subtracting the mean values from the input `x` array, which results in incorrect preprocessing.

### Fixing the bug
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the RGB to BGR conversion and mean subtraction are only applied when the mode is different from `'tf'` or `'torch'`. Additionally, the mean values need to be divided by 255 before subtracting them from the input array. 

### Corrected function
```python
def _preprocess_numpy_input(x, data_format, mode):
    """Preprocesses a Numpy array encoding a batch of images.

    # Arguments
        x: Input array, 3D or 4D.
        data_format: Data format of the image array.
        mode: One of "caffe", "tf" or "torch".
            - caffe: will convert the images from RGB to BGR,
                then will zero-center each color channel with
                respect to the ImageNet dataset,
                without scaling.
            - tf: will scale pixels between -1 and 1,
                sample-wise.
            - torch: will scale pixels between 0 and 1 and then
                will normalize each channel with respect to the
                ImageNet dataset.

    # Returns
        Preprocessed Numpy array.

```

By making these adjustments in the function, it should now correctly preprocess the input array according to the specified `mode` and `data_format`.
