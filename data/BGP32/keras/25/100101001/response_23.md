### Bug in the original function:

The bug in the original `_preprocess_numpy_input` function is related to the calculation of the preprocessed image array based on the input parameters `mode`, `data_format`, and the structure of the input array `x`. The function does not handle all cases correctly, leading to incorrect preprocessing and causing the failing tests.

In the provided failing test, the bug is evident in the mismatch between the expected preprocessed output and the actual output generated by the function. Specifically, the preprocessing logic for the 'caffe', 'tf', and 'torch' modes is not correctly implemented, resulting in incorrect transformations of the input image array.

### Bug Fix Strategy:

To address the bug in the function `_preprocess_numpy_input`, we need to ensure that the preprocessing logic for each mode ('caffe', 'tf', 'torch') is correctly implemented. Additionally, proper handling of the `data_format` and the structure of the input array `x` is crucial to generate the expected preprocessed output.

The following steps can be taken to fix the bug:
1. Implement the correct preprocessing steps for each mode ('caffe', 'tf', 'torch').
2. Check and adjust the manipulation of the input array `x` based on the `data_format` to accommodate both 'channels_first' and 'channels_last'.
3. Verify the normalization and centering calculations based on the mean and standard deviation values for each mode.

### Corrected Version of the Function:

Here is the corrected version of the `_preprocess_numpy_input` function:

```python
def _preprocess_numpy_input(x, data_format, mode):
    if mode == 'tf':
        x /= 127.5
        x -= 1.
        return x

    if mode == 'torch':
        x /= 255.
        mean = [0.485, 0.456, 0.406]
        std = [0.229, 0.224, 0.225]
        x = (x - mean) / std
    else:
        if data_format == 'channels_first':
            if x.ndim == 3:
                x = x[::-1, ...]
            else:
                x = x[:, ::-1, ...]
        else:
            x = x[..., ::-1]
        mean = [103.939, 116.779, 123.68]
        x -= mean

    return x
```

By implementing the correct preprocessing steps for each mode and ensuring proper handling of the `data_format`, this corrected version of the function should pass the failing tests provided.
