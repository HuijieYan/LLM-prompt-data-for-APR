### Bug Explanation:
In the given buggy function `_preprocess_numpy_input`, the bug occurs when the `mode` is not `'tf'` or `'torch'`. In this case, the function incorrectly applies the preprocessing steps for the case when the input is in `'channels_first'` data format, even if the actual data format is `'channels_last'. This leads to incorrect normalization and centering of the input data, causing the failing test.

### Bug Fix:
To fix the bug, we need to correctly handle the data format based on the input parameter `data_format`. If the `data_format` is `'channels_last'`, then the function should process the input in the `'channels_last' format. If the `mode` is `'tf'` or `'torch'`, the function should apply the preprocessing steps accordingly.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def _preprocess_numpy_input(x, data_format, mode):
    if mode == 'tf':
        x /= 127.5
        x -= 1.
        return x

    if mode == 'torch':
        x /= 255.
        mean = [0.485, 0.456, 0.406]
        std = [0.229, 0.224, 0.225]

    if data_format == 'channels_first':
        # 'RGB'->'BGR'
        x = x[:, ::-1, ...]
    else:
        # 'RGB'->'BGR'
        x = x[..., ::-1]
    mean = [103.939, 116.779, 123.68]
    std = None

    x -= mean
    if std is not None:
        x /= std

    return x
```

By making these changes, the corrected function should now handle the input data correctly for both `'channels_first'` and `'channels_last'` data formats, regardless of the `mode` parameter. This should ensure that the failing test cases pass successfully.
