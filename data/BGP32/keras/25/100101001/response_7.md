### Analysis:
The bug in the `_preprocess_numpy_input` function lies in the handling of the `mode` parameter. For the 'caffe' and default case, the function correctly processes the input, but for 'tf' and 'torch' modes, it encounters issues.

- When `mode` is 'tf', the function should scale the input pixels between -1 and 1 sample-wise. However, the current implementation only divides by 127.5 and subtracts 1, which does not achieve the desired scaling.
- When `mode` is 'torch', the function should scale pixels between 0 and 1 and then normalize each channel with respect to the ImageNet dataset. Although the normalization is correctly defined, the scaling by dividing pixels by 255 is missing.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is caused by incorrect scaling operations and missing normalization for the 'tf' and 'torch' modes in the `_preprocess_numpy_input` function.

### Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to adjust the scaling operations for 'tf' mode and include the scaling operation for 'torch' mode before normalizing the data. Additionally, we need to ensure that the processing is correctly applied based on the specified `mode`.

### Corrected Version:

```python
def _preprocess_numpy_input(x, data_format, mode):
    """Preprocesses a Numpy array encoding a batch of images.

    # Arguments
        x: Input array, 3D or 4D.
        data_format: Data format of the image array.
        mode: One of "caffe", "tf" or "torch".

    # Returns
        Preprocessed Numpy array.
    """
    if mode == 'tf':
        x /= 127.5
        x -= 1.
        return x

    if mode == 'torch':
        x /= 255.
        mean = [0.485, 0.456, 0.406]
        std = [0.229, 0.224, 0.225]
        x -= mean
        x /= std
        return x
    
    if data_format == 'channels_first':
        x = x[:, ::-1, ...] if x.ndim == 4 else x[:, ::-1]
    else:
        x = x[..., ::-1]
    mean = [103.939, 116.779, 123.68]
    
    # Zero-center by mean pixel
    x -= mean

    return x
```

In this corrected version:
- For 'tf' mode, the correct scaling by dividing by 127.5 and subtracting 1 is applied.
- For 'torch' mode, pixels are correctly scaled by dividing by 255 before normalizing with respect to the ImageNet dataset.
- The data processing logic is maintained based on the `mode` and `data_format` parameters to ensure correct image preprocessing.
