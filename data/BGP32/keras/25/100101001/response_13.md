### Identified Bug:
The bug is identified in the calculation of the preprocessed Numpy array for the 'caffe' mode. The function is not correctly converting the image from RGB to BGR as expected. This issue is causing the output to be incorrect and the failing test cases to fail.

### Bug Explanation:
1. In the 'caffe' mode, the function should convert the images from RGB to BGR, but this conversion is not correctly implemented.
2. The mean values used for zero-centering in the 'caffe' mode are incorrect, resulting in the wrong preprocessed output.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to correct the conversion from RGB to BGR for the 'caffe' mode and use the appropriate mean values for zero-centering.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def _preprocess_numpy_input(x, data_format, mode):
    if mode == 'tf':
        x /= 127.5
        x -= 1.
        return x

    if mode == 'torch':
        x /= 255.
        mean = [0.485, 0.456, 0.406]
        std = [0.229, 0.224, 0.225]
    elif mode == 'caffe':  # Corrected the 'caffe' mode implementation
        x = x[..., ::-1]
        mean = [103.939, 116.779, 123.68]
        std = None
    else:
        if data_format == 'channels_first':
            if x.ndim == 3:
                x = x[::-1, ...]
            else:
                x = x[:, ::-1, ...]
        else:
            x = x[..., ::-1]
        mean = [103.939, 116.779, 123.68]
        std = None

    if std is not None:
        x -= mean
        x /= std
    else:
        x -= mean
        
    return x
```

By making these corrections, the function should now correctly preprocess the input array and pass the failing test cases.
