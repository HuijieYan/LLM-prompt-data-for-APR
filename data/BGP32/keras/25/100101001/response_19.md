### Bug Explanation
The bug in the `_preprocess_numpy_input` function lies in the block of code that handles the case where `mode` is neither `'tf'` nor `'torch'`. In this block, the function incorrectly subtracts the mean values of [103.939, 116.779, 123.68] from the input array `x`. This operation is only intended for the `'torch'` mode, but it is being applied to all other cases as well.

### Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the mean subtraction operation is only performed when `mode` is set to `'torch'`.

### Corrected Code
```python
def _preprocess_numpy_input(x, data_format, mode):
    if mode == 'tf':
        x /= 127.5
        x -= 1.
        return x

    if mode == 'torch':
        x /= 255.
        mean = [0.485, 0.456, 0.406]
        std = [0.229, 0.224, 0.225]
    else:
        if data_format == 'channels_first':
            # 'RGB'->'BGR'
            if x.ndim == 3:
                x = x[::-1, ...]
            else:
                x = x[:, ::-1, ...]
        else:
            # 'RGB'->'BGR'
            x = x[..., ::-1]
        mean = [103.939, 116.779, 123.68]
        std = None

    # Zero-center by mean pixel
    if mode == 'torch' and data_format == 'channels_first':  # Added condition for 'torch' mode
        if x.ndim == 3:
            x[0, :, :] -= mean[0]
            x[1, :, :] -= mean[1]
            x[2, :, :] -= mean[2]
            if std is not None:
                x[0, :, :] /= std[0]
                x[1, :, :] /= std[1]
                x[2, :, :] /= std[2]
        else:
            x[:, 0, :, :] -= mean[0]
            x[:, 1, :, :] -= mean[1]
            x[:, 2, :, :] -= mean[2]
            if std is not None:
                x[:, 0, :, :] /= std[0]
                x[:, 1, :, :] /= std[1]
                x[:, 2, :, :] /= std[2]
    elif mode == 'torch':  # Added condition for 'torch' mode
        x[..., 0] -= mean[0]
        x[..., 1] -= mean[1]
        x[..., 2] -= mean[2]
        if std is not None:
            x[..., 0] /= std[0]
            x[..., 1] /= std[1]
            x[..., 2] /= std[2]
    return x
``` 

By adding specific conditions for the `'torch'` mode handling, we ensure that the mean subtraction operation is only performed when this mode is selected. This correction should address the bug in the function.
