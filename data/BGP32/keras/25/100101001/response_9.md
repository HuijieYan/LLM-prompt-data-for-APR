### Identifying the Bug
The bug in the `_preprocess_numpy_input` function occurs when the `mode` is not 'tf' or 'torch' and the `data_format` is 'channels_last'. In this case, the function incorrectly subtracts the mean values from the input array `x` without dividing by the standard deviation values, leading to incorrect preprocessing.

### Bug Explanation
In the failing test scenario (Case 1), the function `_preprocess_numpy_input` receives input with mode='caffe', data_format='channels_last', and x with 4 dimensions. When processing the input, the function incorrectly subtracts the mean values [103.939, 116.779, 123.68] from the input array `x` but does not divide by the standard deviation values. This causes the output to be incorrect, leading to failing assertions.

### Fixing the Bug
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that when the `mode` is not 'tf' or 'torch' and the `data_format` is 'channels_last', the function not only subtracts the mean values from the input array but also divides by the standard deviation values. This adjustment will align the preprocessing with the desired behavior.

### Corrected Version of the Function
Here is the corrected version of the `_preprocess_numpy_input` function:

```python
def _preprocess_numpy_input(x, data_format, mode):
    if mode == 'tf':
        x /= 127.5
        x -= 1.
        return x

    if mode == 'torch':
        x /= 255.
        mean = [0.485, 0.456, 0.406]
        std = [0.229, 0.224, 0.225]
    else:
        if data_format == 'channels_first':
            if x.ndim == 3:
                x = x[::-1, ...]
            else:
                x = x[:, ::-1, ...]
        else:
            x = x[..., ::-1]
        mean = [103.939, 116.779, 123.68]
        std = [1., 1., 1.]  # Default standard deviation for normalization

    if std is not None:
        x -= mean
        x /= std

    return x
```

By adding the division by standard deviation values when necessary, we ensure that the preprocessing of the input array is correctly handled in all cases, fixing the bug.
