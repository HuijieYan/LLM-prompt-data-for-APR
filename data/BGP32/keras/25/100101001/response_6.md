### Bug Analysis:
The bug seems to be related to incorrect handling of the `mode='caffe'` condition inside the `_preprocess_numpy_input` function. 
- When `mode='caffe'`, the function should convert the images from RGB to BGR and then zero-center each color channel with respect to the ImageNet dataset without scaling.
- However, the function mistakenly modifies the input `x` array in a way that doesn't align with the expected preprocessing steps for the 'caffe' mode.

### Bug Explanation:
In the provided failing test scenario with `mode='caffe'`, the input `x` array has values in the range of RGB color channels. After applying the function `_preprocess_numpy_input` with `mode='caffe'`, the output `x` array is modified incorrectly, leading to unexpected values that do not match the correct preprocessing for the 'caffe' mode. This discrepancy causes the failing test assertions.

### Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the `mode='caffe'` condition is correctly implemented to achieve the desired preprocessing steps. Specifically, the function should convert the RGB to BGR and zero-center each color channel with respect to the ImageNet dataset without scaling.

### Corrected Version of the Function:

```python
def _preprocess_numpy_input(x, data_format, mode):
    if mode == 'tf':
        x /= 127.5
        x -= 1.
        return x

    if mode == 'torch':
        x /= 255.
        mean = [0.485, 0.456, 0.406]
        std = [0.229, 0.224, 0.225]

    elif mode == 'caffe':
        if data_format == 'channels_first':
            # 'RGB'->'BGR'
            if x.ndim == 3:
                x = x[:, ::-1, ...]
            else:
                x = x[:, :, ::-1, ...]
        else:
            # 'RGB'->'BGR'
            x = x[..., ::-1]
        mean = [103.939, 116.779, 123.68]
        std = None

    # Zero-center by mean pixel
    if data_format == 'channels_first':
        if x.ndim == 3:
            x[0, :, :] -= mean[0]
            x[1, :, :] -= mean[1]
            x[2, :, :] -= mean[2]
            if std is not None:
                x[0, :, :] /= std[0]
                x[1, :, :] /= std[1]
                x[2, :, :] /= std[2]
        else:
            x[:, 0, :, :] -= mean[0]
            x[:, 1, :, :] -= mean[1]
            x[:, 2, :, :] -= mean[2]
            if std is not None:
                x[:, 0, :, :] /= std[0]
                x[:, 1, :, :] /= std[1]
                x[:, 2, :, :] /= std[2]
    else:
        x[..., 0] -= mean[0]
        x[..., 1] -= mean[1]
        x[..., 2] -= mean[2]
        if std is not None:
            x[..., 0] /= std[0]
            x[..., 1] /= std[1]
            x[..., 2] /= std[2]
    
    return x
``` 

After applying this correction, the function `_preprocess_numpy_input` should handle the 'caffe' mode correctly, leading to the expected preprocessing results and passing the failing test.
