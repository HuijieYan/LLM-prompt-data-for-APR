The bug in the `_preprocess_numpy_input` function is caused by the incorrect handling of the data_format and mode conditions. The bug occurs when the mode is not 'tf' or 'torch' and the data_format is not 'channels_first'. In this case, the mean pixel subtraction is not correct, leading to incorrect preprocessing.

To fix the bug, we need to properly handle the 'caffe' mode and 'channels_last' data_format by subtracting the mean pixel values and not forgetting to handle the standard deviation for normalization.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _preprocess_numpy_input(x, data_format, mode):
    """Preprocesses a Numpy array encoding a batch of images.

    # Arguments
        x: Input array, 3D or 4D.
        data_format: Data format of the image array.
        mode: One of "caffe", "tf" or "torch".
            - caffe: will convert the images from RGB to BGR,
                then will zero-center each color channel with
                respect to the ImageNet dataset,
                without scaling.
            - tf: will scale pixels between -1 and 1,
                sample-wise.
            - torch: will scale pixels between 0 and 1 and then
                will normalize each channel with respect to the
                ImageNet dataset.

    # Returns
        Preprocessed Numpy array.
    """
    if mode == 'tf':
        x /= 127.5
        x -= 1.
        return x

    if mode == 'torch':
        x /= 255.
        mean = [0.485, 0.456, 0.406]
        std = [0.229, 0.224, 0.225]
    else:
        if data_format == 'channels_first':
            # 'RGB'->'BGR'
            if x.ndim == 3:
                x = x[:, ::-1, ...]
            else:
                x = x[:, :, ::-1, ...]
        else:
            # 'RGB'->'BGR'
            x = x[..., ::-1]
        mean = [103.939, 116.779, 123.68]
        std = None

    # Zero-center by mean pixel
    x -= mean

    # Normalize by standard deviation
    if std is not None:
        x /= std

    return x
```

This corrected version of the function should now properly preprocess the input array according to the specified mode and data format, handling the 'caffe' mode and 'channels_last' data_format as expected for each case provided.
