The bug in the provided function `_preprocess_numpy_input` is in the else block that handles modes other than 'tf' and 'torch'. In this block, the function is adjusting the input array `x` based on the `mean` values provided, which results in incorrect preprocessing.

The issue arises from the assumption of `data_format` being 'channels_first' within the else block, even though it's not explicitly set there. This leads to incorrect calculations when the actual `data_format` is 'channels_last'.

To fix this bug, we need to adjust the logic in the else block by properly considering the `data_format` instead of assuming it to be 'channels_first'. We should update the calculations and adjustments accordingly.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _preprocess_numpy_input(x, data_format, mode):
    if mode == 'tf':
        x /= 127.5
        x -= 1.
        return x

    if mode == 'torch':
        x /= 255.
        mean = [0.485, 0.456, 0.406]
        std = [0.229, 0.224, 0.225]
    else:
        if data_format == 'channels_first':
            if x.ndim == 3:
                x = x[::-1, ...]
            else:
                x = x[:, ::-1, ...]
        else:
            x = x[..., ::-1]
        mean = [103.939, 116.779, 123.68]
        std = None

    # Zero-center by mean pixel
    if data_format == 'channels_first':
        if x.ndim == 3:
            x[0] -= mean[0]
            x[1] -= mean[1]
            x[2] -= mean[2]
            if std is not None:
                x[0] /= std[0]
                x[1] /= std[1]
                x[2] /= std[2]
        else:
            x[:, 0] -= mean[0]
            x[:, 1] -= mean[1]
            x[:, 2] -= mean[2]
            if std is not None:
                x[:, 0] /= std[0]
                x[:, 1] /= std[1]
                x[:, 2] /= std[2]
    else:
        x[..., 0] -= mean[0]
        x[..., 1] -= mean[1]
        x[..., 2] -= mean[2]
        if std is not None:
            x[..., 0] /= std[0]
            x[..., 1] /= std[1]
            x[..., 2] /= std[2]
    return x
```

This corrected version considers the `data_format` appropriately and adjusts the preprocessing steps accordingly, ensuring the correct handling of input arrays in different data formats and modes.
