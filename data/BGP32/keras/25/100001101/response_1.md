### Analysis:
The bug in the `_preprocess_numpy_input` function lies in the calculation of normalized values based on the given mode ('tf', 'torch', or other). In the provided function, the calculation was incorrect for the 'caffe' mode as it didn't follow the expected preprocessing steps for this mode.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to correctly preprocess the input tensor based on the selected mode. For the 'caffe' mode, the input array should be converted from RGB to BGR and then zero-centered with respect to the ImageNet dataset without scaling.

### Corrected Function:

```python
def _preprocess_numpy_input(x, data_format, mode):
    """Preprocesses a Numpy array encoding a batch of images.

    # Arguments
        x: Input array, 3D or 4D.
        data_format: Data format of the image array.
        mode: One of "caffe", "tf" or "torch".
            - caffe: will convert the images from RGB to BGR,
                then will zero-center each color channel with
                respect to the ImageNet dataset,
                without scaling.
            - tf: will scale pixels between -1 and 1,
                sample-wise.
            - torch: will scale pixels between 0 and 1 and then
                will normalize each channel with respect to the
                ImageNet dataset.

    # Returns
        Preprocessed Numpy array.
    """
    if mode == 'caffe':
        if data_format == 'channels_first':
            x = x[:, ::-1, ...]  # 'RGB'->'BGR' conversion
        else:
            x = x[..., ::-1]  # 'RGB'->'BGR' conversion

        mean = [103.939, 116.779, 123.68]  # ImageNet mean values for BGR
        x -= mean  # Zero-center by mean pixel
        return x

    if mode == 'tf':
        x /= 127.5
        x -= 1.
        return x

    if mode == 'torch':
        x /= 255.
        mean = [0.485, 0.456, 0.406]
        std = [0.229, 0.224, 0.225]
        for i in range(3):
            x[..., i] -= mean[i]
            x[..., i] /= std[i]
        return x

    return x  # Return original tensor if mode is not recognized
```

By updating the 'caffe' mode section to correctly convert the RGB image to BGR and zero-center it based on the ImageNet mean values, we have addressed the bug in the function. This corrected version should now produce the expected output values for the given input parameters and improve the function's reliability in handling different preprocessing modes.
