### Bug Explanation
The bug in the `_preprocess_numpy_input` function arises because the mean subtraction and normalization operations are incorrect when the `mode` is not `'tf'` or `'torch'`. The bug causes incorrect processing of the input array `x`, especially when the `data_format` is `'channels_first'`.

For the failing test in Case 1, the input array `x` is not processed correctly due to the logic within the function being incorrect. The mean subtraction and normalization are not performed as expected.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to adjust the zero-centering by mean pixel and normalization steps for the different modes and data formats appropriately. Specifically, we need to update the logic to correctly handle the image preprocessing based on the provided `mode`, considering the data format as well.

### Corrected Version of the Function
```python
def _preprocess_numpy_input(x, data_format, mode):
    if mode == 'tf':
        x /= 127.5
        x -= 1.
        return x

    if mode == 'torch':
        x /= 255.
        mean = [0.485, 0.456, 0.406]
        std = [0.229, 0.224, 0.225]
    else:
        if data_format == 'channels_first':
            if x.ndim == 3:
                x[0] -= 103.939
                x[1] -= 116.779
                x[2] -= 123.68
                if std is not None:
                    x[0] /= 0.229
                    x[1] /= 0.224
                    x[2] /= 0.225
            else:
                x[:, 0] -= 103.939
                x[:, 1] -= 116.779
                x[:, 2] -= 123.68
                if std is not None:
                    x[:, 0] /= 0.229
                    x[:, 1] /= 0.224
                    x[:, 2] /= 0.225
        else:
            x[..., 0] -= 103.939
            x[..., 1] -= 116.779
            x[..., 2] -= 123.68
            if std is not None:
                x[..., 0] /= 0.229
                x[..., 1] /= 0.224
                x[..., 2] /= 0.225
    return x
```

By making these adjustments, the corrected function should now properly preprocess the input array `x` according to the specified `mode` and `data_format`, ensuring that the expected output matches the corrected processing.
