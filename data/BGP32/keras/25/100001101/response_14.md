The bug in the `_preprocess_numpy_input` function lies in the calculation of the preprocessed values based on the given `mode` and `data_format`. Specifically, the bug occurs when `mode` is not 'tf' or 'torch', and the `data_format` is 'channels_first'. In such cases, the function is not correctly applying the preprocessing steps.

The bug can be fixed by applying the correct preprocessing steps when `mode != 'tf'` or `mode != 'torch'` and `data_format == 'channels_first'`.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _preprocess_numpy_input(x, data_format, mode):
    if mode == 'tf':
        x /= 255.
        x -= 0.5
        return x

    if mode == 'torch':
        x /= 255.
        mean = [0.485, 0.456, 0.406]
        std = [0.229, 0.224, 0.225]
    else:
        if data_format == 'channels_first':
            if x.ndim == 3:
                x[0] -= mean[0]
                x[1] -= mean[1]
                x[2] -= mean[2]
                if std is not None:
                    x[0] /= std[0]
                    x[1] /= std[1]
                    x[2] /= std[2]
            else:
                x[:, 0] -= mean[0]
                x[:, 1] -= mean[1]
                x[:, 2] -= mean[2]
                if std is not None:
                    x[:, 0] /= std[0]
                    x[:, 1] /= std[1]
                    x[:, 2] /= std[2]
        else:
            x[..., 0] -= mean[0]
            x[..., 1] -= mean[1]
            x[..., 2] -= mean[2]
            if std is not None:
                x[..., 0] /= std[0]
                x[..., 1] /= std[1]
                x[..., 2] /= std[2]

    return x
```

This corrected version ensures that the preprocessing steps are correctly applied based on the provided `mode` and `data_format`, resolving the bug identified in the original function.
