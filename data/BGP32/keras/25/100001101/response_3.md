The bug in the `_preprocess_numpy_input` function originates from incorrect handling of the input `data_format` parameter and the corresponding adjustments made to the input `x` array based on the specified `mode`. The bug causes unexpected results for different `data_format` values especially when `mode` is not 'tf' or 'torch'.

To fix the bug, we need to align the processing logic with the correct data format and mode. Specifically:
- For `mode='tf'`, we should divide by 127.5 and subtract 1 for each value in the array.
- For `mode='torch'`, we should divide by 255 and then normalize the channels using the predefined mean and standard deviations.
- For other cases, we need to handle the conversion between RGB and BGR correctly based on the specified `data_format`.

Here is the corrected version of the `_preprocess_numpy_input` function:

```python
def _preprocess_numpy_input(x, data_format, mode):
    if mode == 'tf':
        x /= 127.5
        x -= 1.
        return x

    if mode == 'torch':
        x /= 255.
        mean = [0.485, 0.456, 0.406]
        std = [0.229, 0.224, 0.225]
    else:
        if data_format == 'channels_first':
            # 'RGB'->'BGR'
            if x.ndim == 4:
                x = x[:, ::-1, ...]
            else:
                x = x[..., ::-1]
        else:
            # 'RGB'->'BGR'
            x = x[..., ::-1]
        mean = [103.939, 116.779, 123.68]
        std = None

    if data_format == 'channels_first':
        x[:, 0] -= mean[0]
        x[:, 1] -= mean[1]
        x[:, 2] -= mean[2]
        if std is not None:
            x[:, 0] /= std[0]
            x[:, 1] /= std[1]
            x[:, 2] /= std[2]
    else:
        x[..., 0] -= mean[0]
        x[..., 1] -= mean[1]
        x[..., 2] -= mean[2]
        if std is not None:
            x[..., 0] /= std[0]
            x[..., 1] /= std[1]
            x[..., 2] /= std[2]

    return x
```

This corrected version ensures that the correct preprocessing steps are applied based on the `data_format` and `mode` parameters, resulting in the expected output values for different scenarios as described in the provided test cases.
