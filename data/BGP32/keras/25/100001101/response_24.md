The bug in the provided function `_preprocess_numpy_input` is that the calculation for preprocessed numpy array is incorrect when `mode` is not 'tf' or 'torch'. The mean subtraction and division by standard deviation are not performed correctly based on the given `data_format`.

The bug occurs in the `else` block for all modes other than 'tf' or 'torch'. The mean subtraction and division by standard deviation should be adapted based on the `data_format` to correctly preprocess the input array.

To fix the bug, we need to adjust the mean subtraction and division by standard deviation based on the `data_format`.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _preprocess_numpy_input(x, data_format, mode):
    if mode == 'tf':
        x /= 127.5
        x -= 1.
        return x

    if mode == 'torch':
        x /= 255.
        mean = [0.485, 0.456, 0.406]
        std = [0.229, 0.224, 0.225]
    else:
        if data_format == 'channels_first':
            # 'RGB' -> 'BGR'
            if x.ndim == 3:
                x = x[:, ::-1, ...]
            else:
                x = x[:, :, ::-1, ...]
        else:
            # 'RGB' -> 'BGR'
            x = x[..., ::-1]
        mean = [103.939, 116.779, 123.68]
        std = None

    # Zero-center by mean pixel
    if data_format == 'channels_first':
        x[:, 0, :, :] -= mean[0]
        x[:, 1, :, :] -= mean[1]
        x[:, 2, :, :] -= mean[2]
        if std is not None:
            x[:, 0, :, :] /= std[0]
            x[:, 1, :, :] /= std[1]
            x[:, 2, :, :] /= std[2]
    else:
        x[..., 0] -= mean[0]
        x[..., 1] -= mean[1]
        x[..., 2] -= mean[2]
        if std is not None:
            x[..., 0] /= std[0]
            x[..., 1] /= std[1]
            x[..., 2] /= std[2]
    return x
```

This corrected version of the function should now correctly preprocess the input array based on the provided `mode`, `data_format`, and input array `x`.
