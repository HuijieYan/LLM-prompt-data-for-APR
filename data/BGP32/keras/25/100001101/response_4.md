### Bug Analysis
The bug in the `_preprocess_numpy_input` function arises due to incorrect handling of the input parameters `data_format` and `mode`. The function provides different preprocessing strategies based on the `mode` parameter, such as scaling the pixels between -1 and 1 for `'tf'`, normalizing each channel for `'torch'`, and converting the image from RGB to BGR for other modes. Additionally, it considers the `data_format` for channel ordering.

The bug occurs when the function fails to correctly handle the conversion of the input array `x` based on the `mode`. In the provided case, the input array `x` has shape `(2, 10, 10, 3)` and mode `'caffe'`, however, the conversion to BGR is incorrect and leads to inaccurate results. This is due to the condition in the function that only handles the `'tf'` and `'torch'` modes correctly.

To fix the bug, we need to adjust the logic in the function to properly preprocess the input array based on the `mode` and `data_format`.

### Bug Fix
Here is the corrected version of the `_preprocess_numpy_input` function to handle the given cases properly:

```python
def _preprocess_numpy_input(x, data_format, mode):
    if mode == 'tf':
        x /= 127.5
        x -= 1.
    elif mode == 'torch':
        x /= 255.
        mean = [0.485, 0.456, 0.406]
        std = [0.229, 0.224, 0.225]
    else:
        if data_format == 'channels_first':
            # 'RGB'->'BGR'
            if x.ndim == 4:
                x = x[:, ::-1, ...]
            else:
                x = x[:, :, ::-1, :]
        else:
            # 'RGB'->'BGR'
            x = x[..., ::-1]
        mean = [103.939, 116.779, 123.68]
        std = None

    # Zero-center by mean pixel
    for i in range(3):
        x[..., i] -= mean[i]
        if std is not None:
            x[..., i] /= std[i]

    return x
```

This corrected version handles the different modes and data formats properly to preprocess the input array `x` accordingly. The function applies the correct preprocessing steps based on the mode while considering the channel ordering specified by `data_format`.
