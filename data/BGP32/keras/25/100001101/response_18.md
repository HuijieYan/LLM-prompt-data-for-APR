The bug in the `_preprocess_numpy_input` function lies in the calculation and handling of the mean and std values for normalization based on different modes and data formats.

### Bug Explanation:
For the given buggy function:
- When `mode` is 'caffe' and the `data_format` is 'channels_last', the function should convert the RGB images to BGR. However, the conversion is not correctly performed, which affects the mean subtraction and normalization.
- The values of `mean` and `std` need to be correctly calculated and applied based on the specified `mode` and `data_format`.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to:
1. Correct the RGB to BGR conversion logic for 'caffe' mode when `data_format` is 'channels_last'.
2. Calculate the correct `mean` and `std` values based on the specified `mode` and `data_format`.
3. Update the variable `x` accordingly for proper normalization.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def _preprocess_numpy_input(x, data_format, mode):
    if mode == 'tf':
        x /= 127.5
        x -= 1.
        return x

    if mode == 'torch':
        x /= 255.
        mean = [0.485, 0.456, 0.406]
        std = [0.229, 0.224, 0.225]
    else:
        if data_format == 'channels_first':
            if x.ndim == 4:
                x = x[:, ::-1, ...]
            else:
                x = x[..., ::-1]
        else:
            if x.ndim == 4:
                x = x[..., ::-1]
            else:
                x = x[::-1, ...]
        mean = [103.939, 116.779, 123.68]
        std = None

    # Zero-center by mean pixel
    if std is not None:
        x -= mean
        x /= std
    else:
        x -= mean

    return x
```

The corrected version of the `_preprocess_numpy_input` function now correctly handles the RGB to BGR conversion, calculates and applies the mean and std values for normalization based on the specified `mode` and `data_format`. This version should now satisfy the expected input/output values for the provided test cases.
