### Bug Explanation
The bug occurs when the input parameter `data_format` is set to `'channels_last'`, but the function wrongly assumes that the data format is `'channels_first'`. This leads to incorrect processing of the input array `x`. As a result, the mean subtraction and optional standard deviation division are not performed correctly for the RGB channels.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to adjust the code to correctly handle the data format based on the provided `data_format` parameter. This involves updating the mean subtraction and standard deviation division logic for both `'channels_first'` and `'channels_last'` cases.

### Corrected Function
Here is the corrected version of the `_preprocess_numpy_input` function:

```python
def _preprocess_numpy_input(x, data_format, mode):
    if mode == 'tf':
        x /= 127.5
        x -= 1.
        return x

    if mode == 'torch':
        x /= 255.
        mean = [0.485, 0.456, 0.406]
        std = [0.229, 0.224, 0.225]
    else:
        if data_format == 'channels_first':
            mean = [103.939, 116.779, 123.68]
        else:
            mean = [123.68, 116.779, 103.939]
        std = None

    x -= mean
    if std is not None:
        x /= std

    return x
```

This corrected version properly handles the data format based on the provided `data_format` parameter, ensuring that the mean subtraction and standard deviation division are done correctly for both scenarios.
