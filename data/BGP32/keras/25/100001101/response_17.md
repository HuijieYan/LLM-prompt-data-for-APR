### Bug Explanation
The bug in the `_preprocess_numpy_input` function arises from incorrect handling of the mean and std values based on the `mode` and `data_format` parameters. When `mode` is not 'tf' or 'torch', the function should apply the appropriate normalization using the `mean` values. However, the bug causes incorrect normalization due to mixing up the axes and not properly performing the mean subtraction and optional division by standard deviation.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the mean subtraction and optional division are correctly applied based on the `data_format` and the dimensions of the input array. Specifically:
- Reverse the 'RGB' channels to 'BGR' if the `data_format` is 'channels_first' and adjust the axes accordingly.
- Subtract the mean values from each channel and optionally divide by the standard deviation.

### Corrected Function
```python
def _preprocess_numpy_input(x, data_format, mode):
    if mode == 'tf':
        x /= 127.5
        x -= 1.
        return x

    if mode == 'torch':
        x /= 255.
        mean = [0.485, 0.456, 0.406]
        std = [0.229, 0.224, 0.225]
    else:
        if data_format == 'channels_first':
            # 'RGB'->'BGR'
            if x.ndim == 4:
                x = x[:, ::-1, ...]
            else:
                x = x[..., ::-1]
        else:
            # 'RGB'->'BGR'
            x = x[..., ::-1]
        mean = [103.939, 116.779, 123.68]
        std = None

    if std is not None:
        x -= mean
        x /= std
    else:
        x -= mean

    return x
```

After applying these fixes, the function should correctly preprocess the input image array based on the `mode`, `data_format`, and dimensions, as indicated in the expected variable values for the given test cases.
