### Explanation:
The bug in the `_preprocess_numpy_input` function occurs due to the incorrect handling of the mean subtraction and division by standard deviation operations. The function assumes a specific data format (`channels_first`) which leads to incorrect operations and results when the actual data format is different (`channels_last`). This inconsistency causes the function to provide incorrect preprocessed outputs.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug:
1. Ensure that the mean subtraction and division by standard deviation operations are correctly applied based on the `data_format`.
2. Adjust the array indexing accordingly to handle different data formats (`channels_first` and `channels_last`) appropriately.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def _preprocess_numpy_input(x, data_format, mode):
    if mode == 'tf':
        x /= 127.5
        x -= 1.
        return x

    if mode == 'torch':
        x /= 255.
        mean = [0.485, 0.456, 0.406]
        std = [0.229, 0.224, 0.225]
    else:
        if data_format == 'channels_first':
            if x.ndim == 4:
                # 'RGB'->'BGR'
                x[:, 0] -= 123.68
                x[:, 1] -= 116.779
                x[:, 2] -= 103.939
                x[:, 0] /= 0.229
                x[:, 1] /= 0.224
                x[:, 2] /= 0.225
            else:  # 3D input
                x[0] -= 123.68
                x[1] -= 116.779
                x[2] -= 103.939
            return x
        else:
            if x.ndim == 4:
                # 'RGB'->'BGR'
                x[..., 0] -= 123.68
                x[..., 1] -= 116.779
                x[..., 2] -= 103.939
                x[..., 0] /= 0.229
                x[..., 1] /= 0.224
                x[..., 2] /= 0.225
            else:  # 3D input
                x[..., 0] -= 123.68
                x[..., 1] -= 116.779
                x[..., 2] -= 103.939
            return x
```

This corrected version of the function ensures that the preprocessing steps are applied correctly based on the data format and mode specified. It addresses the indexing and calculations to provide the expected output values for different cases.
