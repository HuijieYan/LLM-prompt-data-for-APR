The bug in the `_preprocess_numpy_input` function is in the handling of the color channel and data format conversion. The bug occurs when the `mode` is not 'tf' or 'torch', and the `data_format` is 'channels_last'. In this case, the function incorrectly applies the mean pixel subtraction but does not divide by the standard deviation.

To fix the bug:
1. Check the conditions correctly based on the `mode` and `data_format`.
2. If the `mode` is neither 'tf' nor 'torch', and the `data_format` is 'channels_last', make sure to perform both mean pixel subtraction and standard deviation division.

Here is the corrected version of the `_preprocess_numpy_input` function:

```python
def _preprocess_numpy_input(x, data_format, mode):
    """Preprocesses a Numpy array encoding a batch of images.

    # Arguments
        x: Input array, 3D or 4D.
        data_format: Data format of the image array.
        mode: One of "caffe", "tf" or "torch".
            - caffe: will convert the images from RGB to BGR,
                then will zero-center each color channel with
                respect to the ImageNet dataset,
                without scaling.
            - tf: will scale pixels between -1 and 1,
                sample-wise.
            - torch: will scale pixels between 0 and 1 and then
                will normalize each channel with respect to the
                ImageNet dataset.

    # Returns
        Preprocessed Numpy array.
    """
    if mode == 'tf':
        x /= 127.5
        x -= 1.
        return x

    if mode == 'torch':
        x /= 255.
        mean = [0.485, 0.456, 0.406]
        std = [0.229, 0.224, 0.225]
    else:
        if data_format == 'channels_first':
            # 'RGB'->'BGR'
            if x.ndim == 3:
                x = x[:, ::-1, ...]  # Corrected channel order
                x[0, :, :] -= mean[0]
                x[1, :, :] -= mean[1]
                x[2, :, :] -= mean[2]
                if std is not None:
                    x[0, :, :] /= std[0]
                    x[1, :, :] /= std[1]
                    x[2, :, :] /= std[2]
            else:
                x = x[:, :, ::-1, ...]  # Corrected channel order
                x[:, 0, :, :] -= mean[0]
                x[:, 1, :, :] -= mean[1]
                x[:, 2, :, :] -= mean[2]
                if std is not None:
                    x[:, 0, :, :] /= std[0]
                    x[:, 1, :, :] /= std[1]
                    x[:, 2, :, :] /= std[2]
        else:
            # 'RGB'->'BGR'
            x = x[..., ::-1]
            x[..., 0] -= mean[0]
            x[..., 1] -= mean[1]
            x[..., 2] -= mean[2]
            if std is not None:
                x[..., 0] /= std[0]
                x[..., 1] /= std[1]
                x[..., 2] /= std[2]
    return x
```

With this correction, the function should now properly preprocess the input images according to the specified `mode` and `data_format`, including dividing by the standard deviation when necessary.
