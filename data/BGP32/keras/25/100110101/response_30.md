### Analysis:
The buggy function `_preprocess_numpy_input` is responsible for preprocessing a Numpy array encoding a batch of images based on the provided `data_format` and `mode`. The bug arises from the calculation and assignment of the mean (`mean`) values to the input data `x` in cases where the mode is not 'tf' or 'torch'.

The failing test specifically fails when the mode is 'caffe' and `data_format` is either 'channels_last' or 'channels_first'. The error message indicates that there is an issue with subtracting the mean values from the input data array `x`.

### Bug:
The bug occurs when the mean values are subtracted from the input `x` array of type 'int32'. The mean values are treated as floating-point numbers, causing a type casting error during subtraction.

### Fix:
To resolve this issue, we need to ensure that the mean values are also converted to the same data type as the input data `x` before being subtracted. This will prevent the type casting error during subtraction and ensure consistent data types throughout the calculation.

### Corrected Function:
```python
def _preprocess_numpy_input(x, data_format, mode):
    """Preprocesses a Numpy array encoding a batch of images.
    
    # Arguments
        x: Input array, 3D or 4D.
        data_format: Data format of the image array.
        mode: One of "caffe", "tf" or "torch".
            - caffe: will convert the images from RGB to BGR,
                then will zero-center each color channel with
                respect to the ImageNet dataset,
                without scaling.
            - tf: will scale pixels between -1 and 1,
                sample-wise.
            - torch: will scale pixels between 0 and 1 and then
                will normalize each channel with respect to the
                ImageNet dataset.

By converting the input `x` to `float32` before subtracting the mean values, the corrected function ensures consistency in data types and resolves the type casting error identified in the failing test case.
