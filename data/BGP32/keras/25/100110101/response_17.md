### Bug Analysis:
The bug occurs when the input data `x` is of type `int32` and the `mode` is `'caffe'`. In this case, when attempting to perform the operation `x[..., 0] -= mean[0]`, the subtraction operation fails because `x` is of type `int32` while `mean[0]` is a floating-point value. This results in the error message `Cannot cast ufunc 'subtract' output from dtype('float64') to dtype('int32')`.

### Bug Fixing Strategy:
To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the input data type matches the expected type for performing arithmetic operations. We should convert the input data `x` to `float32` to allow successful subtraction operations without causing typecasting errors.

### Corrected Function:

```python
import numpy as np

def _preprocess_numpy_input(x, data_format, mode):
    """Preprocesses a Numpy array encoding a batch of images.

    # Arguments
        x: Input array, 3D or 4D.
        data_format: Data format of the image array.
        mode: One of "caffe", "tf" or "torch".
            - caffe: will convert the images from RGB to BGR,
                then will zero-center each color channel with
                respect to the ImageNet dataset,
                without scaling.
            - tf: will scale pixels between -1 and 1,
                sample-wise.
            - torch: will scale pixels between 0 and 1 and then
                will normalize each channel with respect to the
                ImageNet dataset.

    # Returns
        Preprocessed Numpy array.

By converting the input data to `float32` at the beginning of the function, the corrected version ensures that arithmetic operations involving the input data and floating-point values are done successfully without any typecasting errors.
