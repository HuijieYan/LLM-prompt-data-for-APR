### Bug Analysis:
The bug occurs due to incorrect handling of the data type of the input `x`. The function `_preprocess_numpy_input` expects `x` to be a floating-point array, but when an integer array is provided, calculations involving division and subtraction cause problems due to data type mismatch.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the input `x` is treated as a floating-point array before performing division and subtraction operations. This can be achieved by converting `x` to a floating-point array at the start of the function.

### Corrected Function:
```python
import numpy as np

def _preprocess_numpy_input(x, data_format, mode):
    """Preprocesses a Numpy array encoding a batch of images.

    # Arguments
        x: Input array, 3D or 4D.
        data_format: Data format of the image array.
        mode: One of "caffe", "tf" or "torch".
            - caffe: will convert the images from RGB to BGR,
                then will zero-center each color channel with
                respect to the ImageNet dataset,
                without scaling.
            - tf: will scale pixels between -1 and 1,
                sample-wise.
            - torch: will scale pixels between 0 and 1 and then
                will normalize each channel with respect to the
                ImageNet dataset.

    # Returns
        Preprocessed Numpy array.
    """
    x = np.array(x, dtype=np.float32)  # Convert to float array

    if mode == 'tf':
        x /= 127.5
        x -= 1.

                x[0, :, :] /= std[0]

                x[:, 2, :, :] /= std[2]
    else:
        x[..., 0] -= mean[0]

``` 

By converting the input `x` to a floating-point array at the beginning of the function, we prevent the data type mismatch issues that led to the failure of the test case. The corrected function should now handle both integer and float inputs correctly.
