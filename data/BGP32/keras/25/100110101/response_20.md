### Bug Analysis
The bug occurs in the `_preprocess_numpy_input` function when the input `x` is an integer array and the mode is set to 'caffe'. The function performs calculations that involve floating-point numbers, leading to a type mismatch error when trying to subtract a float value from an integer array element. This results in the `UFuncTypeError` in the failing test case.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that all calculations are performed using floating-point numbers, even when the input data is in the form of integers. This can be achieved by casting the input `x` to floating-point before performing arithmetic operations.

### Corrected Function
```python
import numpy as np

def _preprocess_numpy_input(x, data_format, mode):
    x = np.asarray(x, dtype=np.float32)  # Convert input to float32
    
    if mode == 'tf':
        x /= 127.5
        x -= 1.
        return x

    if mode == 'torch':
        x /= 255.
        mean = [0.485, 0.456, 0.406]
        std = [0.229, 0.224, 0.225]
    else:
        if data_format == 'channels_first':
            # 'RGB'->'BGR'
            if x.ndim == 3:
                x = x[::-1, ...]
            else:
                x = x[:, ::-1, ...]
        else:
            # 'RGB'->'BGR'
            x = x[..., ::-1]
        mean = [103.939, 116.779, 123.68]
        std = None

    # Zero-center by mean pixel
    if data_format == 'channels_first':
        if x.ndim == 3:
            x[0, :, :] -= mean[0]
            x[1, :, :] -= mean[1]
            x[2, :, :] -= mean[2]
            if std is not None:
                x[0, :, :] /= std[0]
                x[1, :, :] /= std[1]
                x[2, :, :] /= std[2]
        else:
            x[:, 0, :, :] -= mean[0]
            x[:, 1, :, :] -= mean[1]
            x[:, 2, :, :] -= mean[2]
            if std is not None:
                x[:, 0, :, :] /= std[0]
                x[:, 1, :, :] /= std[1]
                x[:, 2, :, :] /= std[2]
    else:
        x[..., 0] -= mean[0]
        x[..., 1] -= mean[1]
        x[..., 2] -= mean[2]
        if std is not None:
            x[..., 0] /= std[0]
            x[..., 1] /= std[1]
            x[..., 2] /= std[2]
    
    return x
```

After applying the above fixes, the `_preprocess_numpy_input` function should correctly process both integer and float arrays while avoiding the type mismatch error encountered in the failing test.
