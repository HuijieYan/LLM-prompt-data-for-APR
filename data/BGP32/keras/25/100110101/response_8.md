### Bug Analysis:
The buggy function `_preprocess_numpy_input` is designed to preprocess a numpy array representing a batch of images based on the given `mode` and `data_format`. The bug arises when the input `x` is modified incorrectly due to data type compatibility issues. Specifically, the bug triggers when trying to perform subtraction operations on numpy arrays with float64 type elements and int32 type elements, causing a `UFuncTypeError`.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the input `x` is properly converted to a float data type if necessary, before performing arithmetic operations that involve floating-point numbers. By casting the input `x` to `float32` at the beginning of the function, we can avoid data type conflicts that lead to the error.

### Corrected Function:

```python
import numpy as np

def _preprocess_numpy_input(x, data_format, mode):
    """Preprocesses a Numpy array encoding a batch of images.

    # Arguments
        x: Input array, 3D or 4D.
        data_format: Data format of the image array.
        mode: One of "caffe", "tf" or "torch".
            - caffe: will convert the images from RGB to BGR,
                then will zero-center each color channel with
                respect to the ImageNet dataset,
                without scaling.
            - tf: will scale pixels between -1 and 1,
                sample-wise.
            - torch: will scale pixels between 0 and 1 and then
                will normalize each channel with respect to the
                ImageNet dataset.

        Preprocessed Numpy array.

By converting the input `x` to `float32` at the beginning of the function, we ensure that subsequent arithmetic operations are performed with compatible data types, resolving the initial bug. The corrected function should now pass the failing test cases and provide the expected output values.
