### Bug Analysis:
The bug occurs when the function tries to subtract the mean value from the input array `x`, resulting in a `UFuncTypeError: Cannot cast ufunc 'subtract' output from dtype('float64') to dtype('int32') with casting rule 'same_kind'`. This error is due to the mismatch in data types between the mean values (float) and the input array `x`.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the mean values are compatible with the data type of the input array `x`. We can achieve this by converting the mean values to the same data type as `x` before subtraction.

### Corrected Function:
Here is the corrected version of the `_preprocess_numpy_input` function:

```python
def _preprocess_numpy_input(x, data_format, mode):
    """Preprocesses a Numpy array encoding a batch of images.

    # Arguments
        x: Input array, 3D or 4D.
        data_format: Data format of the image array.
        mode: One of "caffe", "tf" or "torch".
            - caffe: will convert the images from RGB to BGR,
                then will zero-center each color channel with
                respect to the ImageNet dataset,
                without scaling.
            - tf: will scale pixels between -1 and 1,
                sample-wise.
            - torch: will scale pixels between 0 and 1 and then
                will normalize each channel with respect to the
                ImageNet dataset.

    # Returns
        Preprocessed Numpy array.
    """
    if mode == 'tf':
        x /= 127.5
        x -= 1.
        return x

    if mode == 'torch':
        x /= 255.
        mean = [0.485, 0.456, 0.406]
        std = [0.229, 0.224, 0.225]
    elif mode == 'caffe':
        mean = [103.939, 116.779, 123.68]
        std = None

    if mean is not None:
        x_mean = x.astype(np.float32)  # Convert x to float32 for subtraction
        x_mean -= np.array(mean, dtype=np.float32)  # Subtract mean values
        
        if data_format == 'channels_first':
            if std is not None:
                x_mean /= np.array(std, dtype=np.float32)  # Normalize by std values

        return x_mean

    return x
```

By converting both the input array `x` and the mean values to `np.float32` before subtraction, we ensure that the types match, resolving the `UFuncTypeError` encountered during the failing test.
