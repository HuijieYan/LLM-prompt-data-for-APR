### Bug Analysis:
The bug occurs in the `_preprocess_numpy_input` function when the input mode is `'torch'` and the data format is either `'channels_last'` or `'channels_first'`. The bug is due to the fact that the input array `x` is an integer array while the calculations involve division and subtraction operations, which convert the elements into floats. This inconsistency results in the error `UFuncTypeError`.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the operations are performed on float values. We can modify the function to always convert the input array `x` to a float array before performing any calculations in the preprocessing steps.

### Corrected Function:

```python
import numpy as np
import keras.applications.imagenet_utils as utils

def _preprocess_numpy_input(x, data_format, mode):
    """Preprocesses a Numpy array encoding a batch of images.

    # Arguments
        x: Input array, 3D or 4D.
        data_format: Data format of the image array.
        mode: One of "caffe", "tf" or "torch".
            - caffe: will convert the images from RGB to BGR,
                then will zero-center each color channel with
                respect to the ImageNet dataset,
                without scaling.
            - tf: will scale pixels between -1 and 1,
                sample-wise.
            - torch: will scale pixels between 0 and 1 and then
                will normalize each channel with respect to the
                ImageNet dataset.

    # Returns
        Preprocessed Numpy array.

```

After applying this fix, the `UFuncTypeError` should be resolved, and the function should provide the expected preprocessing of the input images.
