### Bug Explanation:
The bug occurs due to the inconsistency of data types. When the input `x` is of type `int32` and the variable `mean` is used to subtract values from `x`, which is expected to be of type `float32`, a datatype casting error arises.

### Bug Fix:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the `mean` values are of type `float32` so that when subtracting from `x`, the data types are compatible and no casting error occurs.

### The corrected function:

```python
def _preprocess_numpy_input(x, data_format, mode):
    """Preprocesses a Numpy array encoding a batch of images.

    # Arguments
        x: Input array, 3D or 4D.
        data_format: Data format of the image array.
        mode: One of "caffe", "tf" or "torch".
            - caffe: will convert the images from RGB to BGR,
                then will zero-center each color channel with
                respect to the ImageNet dataset,
                without scaling.
            - tf: will scale pixels between -1 and 1,
                sample-wise.
            - torch: will scale pixels between 0 and 1 and then
                will normalize each channel with respect to the
                ImageNet dataset.

    # Returns
        Preprocessed Numpy array.
    """
    if mode == 'tf':
        x /= 127.5
        x -= 1.
        return x

    if mode == 'torch':
        x = x.astype('float32')  # Convert to float32
        x /= 255.
        mean = np.array([0.485, 0.456, 0.406], dtype='float32')
        std = np.array([0.229, 0.224, 0.225], dtype='float32')
    else:
        x = x.astype('float32')  # Convert to float32
        if data_format == 'channels_first':
            # 'RGB'->'BGR'
            if x.ndim == 3:
                x = x[:, ::-1, ...]
            else:
                x = x[:, ::-1]
        else:
            # 'RGB'->'BGR'
            x = x[..., ::-1]
        mean = np.array([103.939, 116.779, 123.68], dtype='float32')
        std = None

    # Zero-center by mean pixel
    if data_format == 'channels_first':
        x -= mean[:, None, None]
        if std is not None:
            x /= std[:, None, None]
    else:
        x -= mean
        if std is not None:
            x /= std
    
    return x

```

This corrected version of the function ensures that all relevant variables are of type `float32` when operating with `x`, resolving the datatype casting error and aligning with the expected behavior.
