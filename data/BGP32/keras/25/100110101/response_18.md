### Bug Explanation:
The bug occurs when the input `x` is of integer type, and the calculations result in floating-point values. This leads to a type mismatch when subtracting those floating-point values from the original integer array `x` causing the `UFuncTypeError`. The issue arises due to the inconsistency in variable types (`int` vs `float`) during the calculations.

### Bug Fix:
To resolve this bug, we need to ensure that the calculations are performed with consistent types. In this case, we can convert the input `x` to floating-point before performing the calculations.

### Corrected Function:

```python
def _preprocess_numpy_input(x, data_format, mode):
    """Preprocesses a Numpy array encoding a batch of images.

    # Arguments
        x: Input array, 3D or 4D.
        data_format: Data format of the image array.
        mode: One of "caffe", "tf" or "torch".
            - caffe: will convert the images from RGB to BGR,
                then will zero-center each color channel with
                respect to the ImageNet dataset,
                without scaling.
            - tf: will scale pixels between -1 and 1,
                sample-wise.
            - torch: will scale pixels between 0 and 1 and then
                will normalize each channel with respect to the
                ImageNet dataset.

    # Returns
        Preprocessed Numpy array.
    """
    x = x.astype('float32')  # Convert input to float

    if mode == 'tf':
        x /= 127.5
        x -= 1.

    if mode == 'torch':
        x /= 255.

                x[0, :, :] /= std[0]
                x[1, :, :] /= std[1]
                x[2, :, :] /= std[2]

    else:
        x[..., 0] -= mean[0]
        x[..., 1] -= mean[1]
        x[..., 2] -= mean[2]
        if std is not None:

    return x
```

By converting the input `x` to float at the beginning of the function, we ensure that all subsequent calculations are done with floating-point values, avoiding the type mismatch issue. This corrected function should now pass the failing test cases and produce the expected outputs.
