### Bug Description:
The bug occurs due to an attempt to perform operations using numpy arrays with different data types (`int32` and `float32`). The `mean` values are specified as `float` numbers, causing a mismatch in types during subtraction in the calculation.

### Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, ensure that the input array `x` is cast to the same data type as the `mean` values before performing operations that involve the mean subtraction. This will prevent type conflicts during calculations.

### Corrected Function:
```python
import numpy as np

def _preprocess_numpy_input(x, data_format, mode):
    """Preprocesses a Numpy array encoding a batch of images.

    # Arguments
        x: Input array, 3D or 4D.
        data_format: Data format of the image array.
        mode: One of "caffe", "tf" or "torch".
            - caffe: will convert the images from RGB to BGR,
                then will zero-center each color channel with
                respect to the ImageNet dataset,
                without scaling.
            - tf: will scale pixels between -1 and 1,
                sample-wise.
            - torch: will scale pixels between 0 and 1 and then
                will normalize each channel with respect to the
                ImageNet dataset.

    # Returns
        Preprocessed Numpy array.

    x = np.asarray(x, dtype=np.float32)  # Convert x to float32

    if mode == 'tf':
        x /= 127.5
        x -= 1.
        return x

    if mode == 'torch':
        x /= 255.

            x[:, 0, :, :] -= mean[0]

            if std is not None:
                x[:, 0, :, :] /= std[0]
                x[:, 1, :, :] /= std[1]
                x[:, 2, :, :] /= std[2]
    else:

``` 

By converting the input array `x` to `float32` at the beginning of the function, we ensure that all subsequent operations involving `mean` values are performed using the same data type, avoiding the type conflict that led to the bug.
