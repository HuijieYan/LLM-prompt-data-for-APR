### Bug Analysis:
The bug occurs when the function attempts to process an input array in the case where the data_format is 'channels_first' and the mode is 'caffe'. This leads to a TypeError because the function performs arithmetic operations on the input array (specifically subtraction) using float values, which causes a conflict with the dtype of the input array, which is int32 in this case.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to make sure that the operations performed on the input array are consistent with its data type. Specifically, we need to handle the case where the input array is of type int32 when subtracting the mean values. We can achieve this by converting the mean values to float before performing the subtraction operation.

### Corrected Function:
```python
import numpy as np

def _preprocess_numpy_input(x, data_format, mode):
    if mode == 'tf':
        x /= 127.5
        x -= 1.
        return x

    if mode == 'torch':
        x /= 255.
        mean = [0.485, 0.456, 0.406]
        std = [0.229, 0.224, 0.225]
    else:
        if data_format == 'channels_first':
            if x.ndim == 3:
                x = x[::-1, ...]
            else:
                x = x[:, ::-1, ...]
        else:
            x = x[..., ::-1]
        mean = [103.939, 116.779, 123.68]
        std = None

    mean = np.array(mean).astype(np.float32)  # Convert mean to float

    if data_format == 'channels_first':
        if x.ndim == 3:
            x[0, :, :] -= mean[0]
            x[1, :, :] -= mean[1]
            x[2, :, :] -= mean[2]
            if std is not None:
                x[0, :, :] /= std[0]
                x[1, :, :] /= std[1]
                x[2, :, :] /= std[2]
        else:
            x[:, 0, :, :] -= mean[0]
            x[:, 1, :, :] -= mean[1]
            x[:, 2, :, :] -= mean[2]
            if std is not None:
                x[:, 0, :, :] /= std[0]
                x[:, 1, :, :] /= std[1]
                x[:, 2, :, :] /= std[2]
    else:
        x[..., 0] -= mean[0]
        x[..., 1] -= mean[1]
        x[..., 2] -= mean[2]
        if std is not None:
            x[..., 0] /= std[0]
            x[..., 1] /= std[1]
            x[..., 2] /= std[2]
    
    return x
```

By converting the mean values to float data type before performing subtraction, we ensure compatibility with the input array dtype. This correction should resolve the TypeError issue encountered during the failing test.
