### Analysis:
The error message indicates that a `UFuncTypeError` occurs when subtracting a float value from an integer array element. This error is caused by the inconsistency in data types during the calculations within the function `_preprocess_numpy_input`. The function is not handling the data types of elements appropriately, leading to the error encountered.

### Bug:
The bug arises in the calculation part where subtraction is performed on the input array `x`. Since the input array `x` can be of type `int32`, and the mean values are floats, performing subtraction directly leads to the type casting issue. This results in the `UFuncTypeError` message due to the mismatch in the data types during the arithmetic operations.

### Fix:
To resolve this bug, we need to ensure that the `mean` values are converted to the same type as elements in the input array `x` before performing any arithmetic operations.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
import numpy as np

def _preprocess_numpy_input(x, data_format, mode):
    """Preprocesses a Numpy array encoding a batch of images.

    # Arguments
        x: Input array, 3D or 4D.
        data_format: Data format of the image array.
        mode: One of "caffe", "tf" or "torch".
            - caffe: will convert the images from RGB to BGR,
                then will zero-center each color channel with
                respect to the ImageNet dataset,
                without scaling.
            - tf: will scale pixels between -1 and 1,
                sample-wise.
            - torch: will scale pixels between 0 and 1 and then
                will normalize each channel with respect to the
                ImageNet dataset.

    # Returns
        Preprocessed Numpy array.
    """
    if mode == 'tf':
        x = x / 127.5
        x -= 1.
        return x

    if mode == 'torch':
        x = x / 255.
        mean = np.array([0.485, 0.456, 0.406]).astype(x.dtype)
        std = np.array([0.229, 0.224, 0.225]).astype(x.dtype)
    else:
        if data_format == 'channels_first':
            # 'RGB'->'BGR'
            if x.ndim == 3:
                x = x[:, ::-1, ...]
            else:
                x = x[:, :, ::-1, ...]
        else:
            # 'RGB'->'BGR'
            x = x[..., ::-1]
        mean = np.array([103.939, 116.779, 123.68]).astype(x.dtype)
        std = None

    # Zero-center by mean pixel
    x -= mean.reshape(1, 1, 1, -1)
    if std is not None:
        x /= std.reshape(1, 1, 1, -1)

    return x
```

By adjusting the mean values to match the datatype of the input array and using `numpy` operations for consistency, the corrected version of the function should now handle the data type issue and pass the failing test cases.
