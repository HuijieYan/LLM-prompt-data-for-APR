### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_preprocess_numpy_input` preprocesses a Numpy array of images based on the chosen mode and data format.
2. The error occurs due to the casting of data types during the calculation of the preprocessed data, leading to a `UFuncTypeError`.
3. The error message points to the line where subtraction is attempted on `int32` datatype, led by the assumed cast from `float64` mean values. The subtraction operation results in an invalid cast.
4. To fix this bug, we need to ensure that all intermediate calculations are performed in a compatible data type.
   
### Suggestions for fixing the bug:
1. Ensure that the data type of `x` remains consistent throughout calculations.
2. Perform all mean/subtraction operations in the same datatype as the input `x`.
3. Regularize the data format and mode handling for consistent processing.

### Corrected version of the function:

```python
def _preprocess_numpy_input(x, data_format, mode):
    if mode == 'tf':
        x = x / 127.5 - 1
        return x

    if mode == 'torch':
        x = x / 255.
        mean = [0.485, 0.456, 0.406]
        std = [0.229, 0.224, 0.225]
    else:
        if data_format == 'channels_first':
            # 'RGB'->'BGR'
            if x.ndim == 3:
                x = x[:, ::-1, ...]
            else:
                x = x[:, :, ::-1, ...]
        else:
            # 'RGB'->'BGR'
            x = x[..., ::-1]
        mean = [103.939, 116.779, 123.68]
        std = None

    mean = np.array(mean, dtype=x.dtype)  # To match data type with x

    # Zero-center by mean pixel
    x -= mean
    if std is not None:
        std = np.array(std, dtype=x.dtype)  # To match data type with x
        x /= std
    return x
```

After implementing these changes, the function should pass the failing test cases and adhere to the expected input/output values.
