### Bug Explanation

The bug arises from the attempt to perform arithmetic operations on `numpy` arrays containing integers while the operations are designed for floating-point numbers. The error message explicitly states: "Cannot cast ufunc 'subtract' output from dtype('float64') to dtype('int32') with casting rule 'same_kind'". This occurs when trying to subtract a floating-point array from an integer array.

### Bug Fix Strategy

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that all arithmetic operations are performed on floating-point numbers rather than integers. We will modify the code to cast the input arrays to float before performing any arithmetic operations. This will prevent any type casting errors that result from mixing integers and floats in arithmetic operations.

### Corrected Version of the Function

The following corrected function uses the `astype` method to cast the input `numpy` array `x` to floating-point numbers before applying any arithmetic operations.

```python
import numpy as np

def _preprocess_numpy_input(x, data_format, mode):
    if mode == 'tf':
        x = x.astype(float)
        x /= 127.5
        x -= 1.
        return x

    if mode == 'torch':
        x = x.astype(float)
        x /= 255.
        mean = [0.485, 0.456, 0.406]
        std = [0.229, 0.224, 0.225]
    else:
        x = x.astype(float)
        if data_format == 'channels_first':
            # 'RGB'->'BGR'
            if x.ndim == 3:
                x = x[::-1, ...]
            else:
                x = x[:, ::-1, ...]
        else:
            # 'RGB'->'BGR'
            x = x[..., ::-1]
        mean = [103.939, 116.779, 123.68]
        std = None

    # Zero-center by mean pixel
    if data_format == 'channels_first':
        if x.ndim == 3:
            x[0, :, :] -= mean[0]
            x[1, :, :] -= mean[1]
            x[2, :, :] -= mean[2]
            if std is not None:
                x[0, :, :] /= std[0]
                x[1, :, :] /= std[1]
                x[2, :, :] /= std[2]
        else:
            x[:, 0, :, :] -= mean[0]
            x[:, 1, :, :] -= mean[1]
            x[:, 2, :, :] -= mean[2]
            if std is not None:
                x[:, 0, :, :] /= std[0]
                x[:, 1, :, :] /= std[1]
                x[:, 2, :, :] /= std[2]
    else:
        x[..., 0] -= mean[0]
        x[..., 1] -= mean[1]
        x[..., 2] -= mean[2]
        if std is not None:
            x[..., 0] /= std[0]
            x[..., 1] /= std[1]
            x[..., 2] /= std[2]
    return x
```

This corrected function ensures that all input arrays are cast to floating-point numbers before performing any arithmetic operations, avoiding type casting errors.
