### Bug Analysis:
The buggy function `_preprocess_numpy_input` encounters an error when trying to subtract the mean values from the input `x` array due to a type mismatch. The error arises when `x` is of type `int32`, but the operation attempts to subtract a `float64` value from it, leading to a `UFuncTypeError`.

### Bug Fix:
To fix this bug, all arithmetic operations need to be performed on `x` after casting it to a float type. This ensures compatibility for the subtraction operations involving mean values. 

Additionally, the array `mean` should be converted to a numpy array for easier element-wise subtraction and division operations with the input `x`.

### Corrected Function:
```python
import numpy as np

def _preprocess_numpy_input(x, data_format, mode):
    """Preprocesses a Numpy array encoding a batch of images.

    # Arguments
        x: Input array, 3D or 4D.
        data_format: Data format of the image array.
        mode: One of "caffe", "tf" or "torch".
            - caffe: will convert the images from RGB to BGR,
                then will zero-center each color channel with
                respect to the ImageNet dataset,
                without scaling.
            - tf: will scale pixels between -1 and 1,
                sample-wise.
            - torch: will scale pixels between 0 and 1 and then
                will normalize each channel with respect to the
                ImageNet dataset.

    # Returns
        Preprocessed Numpy array.
    """
    x = x.astype('float32')  # Convert to float for arithmetic operations
    
    if mode == 'tf':
        x /= 127.5
        x -= 1.
        return x

    if mode == 'torch':
        x /= 255.
        mean = np.array([0.485, 0.456, 0.406], dtype=np.float32)
        std = np.array([0.229, 0.224, 0.225], dtype=np.float32)
    else:
        if data_format == 'channels_first':
            # 'RGB'->'BGR'
            if x.ndim == 3:
                x = x[:, ::-1, ...]
            else:
                x = x[:, :, ::-1, ...]
        else:
            # 'RGB'->'BGR'
            x = x[..., ::-1]
        mean = np.array([103.939, 116.779, 123.68], dtype=np.float32)
        std = None

    # Zero-center by mean pixel
    if data_format == 'channels_first':
        x -= mean[:, np.newaxis, np.newaxis]
        if std is not None:
            x /= std[:, np.newaxis, np.newaxis]
    else:
        x -= mean
        if std is not None:
            x /= std

    return x
```

By casting `x` to `float32` and converting the `mean` variable to a numpy array, the corrected function ensures that all arithmetic operations are performed consistently, avoiding any type mismatches that could lead to errors like the one previously encountered.
