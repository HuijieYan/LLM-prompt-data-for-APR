### Analysis:
The bug occurs when the input array `x` has a dtype of `int32`, and the calculations in the `_preprocess_numpy_input` function lead to a mismatch in the data types causing a `UFuncTypeError`. The bug specifically arises from the following line:
```python
x[..., 0] -= mean[0]
```
The operation `-=` is applied to an array (`x[..., 0]`) with dtype `int32` using a value from `mean`, which is of type `float`. This data type mismatch causes the error.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the operations are consistent with the data types. For calculations involving the `x` array and the `mean` values, we need to ensure they are the same data type. In this case, to resolve the mismatch, we need to convert the `x` array from `int32` to `float` before performing the subtraction operation with the mean values.

### Corrected Function:
```python
def _preprocess_numpy_input(x, data_format, mode):
    """Preprocesses a Numpy array encoding a batch of images.

    # Arguments
        x: Input array, 3D or 4D.
        data_format: Data format of the image array.
        mode: One of "caffe", "tf" or "torch".
            - caffe: will convert the images from RGB to BGR,
                then will zero-center each color channel with
                respect to the ImageNet dataset,
                without scaling.
            - tf: will scale pixels between -1 and 1,
                sample-wise.
            - torch: will scale pixels between 0 and 1 and then
                will normalize each channel with respect to the
                ImageNet dataset.

    # Returns
        Preprocessed Numpy array.

By converting the input array `x` to `float32` before performing operations that involve floating-point values, we can prevent the data type mismatch and resolve the `UFuncTypeError` that was occurring.
