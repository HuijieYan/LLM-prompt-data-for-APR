### Bug Explanation:
The bug in the function `_preprocess_numpy_input` occurs in the calculation of the preprocessed array when the `mode` is not 'tf' or 'torch'. In such cases, the function is supposed to convert the color channels from RGB to BGR and zero-center each color channel with respect to the ImageNet dataset. However, the calculations for mean subtraction and division are incorrect, leading to the incorrect preprocessed array.

### Bug Location:
The bug can be identified in the section after the `else` statement when the `mode` is neither 'tf' nor 'torch'. The mean subtraction and division logic inside the conditional blocks for `data_format == 'channels_first'` and `data_format == 'channels_last'` is incorrect, leading to the incorrect preprocessing of the input array.

### Bug Fix:
To fix this bug, we need to correct the mean subtraction and division logic when the `mode` is neither 'tf' nor 'torch'. The correct procedure is to subtract the mean values corresponding to BGR channels (103.939, 116.779, 123.68) and optionally divide by the standard deviation values, if available.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def _preprocess_numpy_input(x, data_format, mode):
    if mode == 'tf':
        x /= 127.5
        x -= 1.
        return x

    if mode == 'torch':
        x /= 255.
        mean = [0.485, 0.456, 0.406]
        std = [0.229, 0.224, 0.225]
    else:
        if data_format == 'channels_first':
            if x.ndim == 3:
                x = x[:, ::-1, ...]
            else:
                x = x[:, :, ::-1, :]
        else:
            x = x[..., ::-1]
        mean = [103.939, 116.779, 123.68]
        std = None

    # Zero-center by mean pixel
    x -= mean
    if std is not None:
        x /= std

    return x
```

In this corrected version, the mean subtraction and division are performed correctly for both 'channels_first' and 'channels_last' data formats when `mode` is not 'tf' or 'torch'. This fix should address the bug and provide the correct preprocessing of the input array.
