### Bug Analysis:
1. The bug occurs when the `mode` is not 'tf' or 'torch' and the `data_format` is not 'channels_first'. In this case, the function incorrectly modifies the input array `x` without scaling or zero-centering it as expected.
2. The bug is specifically happening when the `mode` is not 'tf' or 'torch' and the `data_format` is 'channels_last'.
3. The cause of the bug is that the function is not properly handling the 'channels_last' data format when the mode is not 'tf' or 'torch'. It incorrectly assumes the 'channels_first' data format, leading to incorrect calculations for mean pixel subtraction and normalization.
4. To fix the bug, we need to ensure that when the `data_format` is 'channels_last' and the `mode` is not 'tf' or 'torch', the function correctly applies the RGB to BGR conversion and zero-centering according to the ImageNet dataset mean values.

### Bug Fix:
Below is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _preprocess_numpy_input(x, data_format, mode):
    if mode == 'tf':
        x /= 127.5
        x -= 1.
        return x

    if mode == 'torch':
        x /= 255.
        mean = [0.485, 0.456, 0.406]
        std = [0.229, 0.224, 0.225]
    else:
        # 'channels_last' assumed when data_format is not 'channels_first'
        if x.ndim == 3:
            x = x[:, :, ::-1]  # 'RGB'->'BGR'
        else:
            x = x[:, :, :, ::-1]  # 'RGB'->'BGR'
        mean = [103.939, 116.779, 123.68]
        std = None

    # Zero-center by mean pixel
    x -= mean
    if std is not None:
        x /= std

    return x
```

By correctly addressing the data format issue and applying the necessary RGB to BGR conversion, zero-centering, and normalization, the function should now work as intended for the 'channels_last' data format and other modes besides 'tf' and 'torch'.
