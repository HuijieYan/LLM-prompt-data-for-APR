### Bug Explanation
The buggy function `_preprocess_numpy_input` has an issue when the mode is neither 'tf' nor 'torch'. In this case, if the `data_format` is 'channels_last', the function incorrectly performs the RGB to BGR conversion and then subtracts the mean values for the BGR channels from the input x. However, it omits the step of dividing by the standard deviation after subtracting the mean values, leading to incorrect preprocessing.

### Bug Fix
To fix this bug, we need to ensure that after subtracting the mean values from the input x, we also divide by the standard deviation if it is not None.

### Corrected Version of the Function

```python
def _preprocess_numpy_input(x, data_format, mode):
    if mode == 'tf':
        x /= 127.5
        x -= 1.
        return x

    if mode == 'torch':
        x /= 255.
        mean = [0.485, 0.456, 0.406]
        std = [0.229, 0.224, 0.225]
    else:
        if data_format == 'channels_first':
            # 'RGB'->'BGR'
            if x.ndim == 3:
                x = x[::-1, ...]
            else:
                x = x[:, ::-1, ...]
        else:
            # 'RGB'->'BGR'
            x = x[..., ::-1]
        mean = [103.939, 116.779, 123.68]
        std = None

    # Zero-center by mean pixel
    if data_format == 'channels_first':
        if x.ndim == 3:
            x[0, :, :] -= mean[0]
            x[1, :, :] -= mean[1]
            x[2, :, :] -= mean[2]
            if std is not None:
                x[0, :, :] /= std[0]
                x[1, :, :] /= std[1]
                x[2, :, :] /= std[2]
        else:
            x[:, 0, :, :] -= mean[0]
            x[:, 1, :, :] -= mean[1]
            x[:, 2, :, :] -= mean[2]
            if std is not None:
                x[:, 0, :, :] /= std[0]
                x[:, 1, :, :] /= std[1]
                x[:, 2, :, :] /= std[2]
    else:
        x[..., 0] -= mean[0]
        x[..., 1] -= mean[1]
        x[..., 2] -= mean[2]
        if std is not None:
            x[..., 0] /= std[0]
            x[..., 1] /= std[1]
            x[..., 2] /= std[2]
    return x
``` 

This corrected version of the function now includes the missing division by the standard deviation after subtracting the mean values in the case when `mode` is not 'tf' or 'torch' and `data_format` is 'channels_last'.
