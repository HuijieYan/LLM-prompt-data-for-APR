### Bug Explanation
In the `_preprocess_numpy_input` function, the bug occurs when the `mode` is not set to `'tf'` or `'torch'`. In this case, if the `data_format` is set to `'channels_last'`, the function incorrectly subtracts the mean values from the input array `x` without considering the correct channel ordering of 'RGB' to 'BGR'. This leads to incorrect preprocessing of the input array.

### Bug Fix
To fix the bug, the function should correctly handle the conversion from 'RGB' to 'BGR' based on the `data_format` and reorder the channels accordingly before subtracting the mean values if the `mode` is not `'tf'` or `'torch'. Additionally, the function should handle the normalization of the input array when the `mode` is set to `'torch'`.

### Corrected Version of the Function
```python
def _preprocess_numpy_input(x, data_format, mode):
    """Preprocesses a Numpy array encoding a batch of images.

    # Arguments
        x: Input array, 3D or 4D.
        data_format: Data format of the image array.
        mode: One of "caffe", "tf" or "torch".
            - caffe: will convert the images from RGB to BGR,
                then will zero-center each color channel with
                respect to the ImageNet dataset,
                without scaling.
            - tf: will scale pixels between -1 and 1,
                sample-wise.
            - torch: will scale pixels between 0 and 1 and then
                will normalize each channel with respect to the
                ImageNet dataset.

    # Returns
        Preprocessed Numpy array.
    """
    if mode == 'tf':
        x /= 127.5
        x -= 1.
        return x

    if mode == 'torch':
        x /= 255.
        mean = [0.485, 0.456, 0.406]
        std = [0.229, 0.224, 0.225]
        
        # Normalize each channel with respect to the ImageNet dataset
        x[..., 0] -= mean[0]
        x[..., 1] -= mean[1]
        x[..., 2] -= mean[2]

        x[..., 0] /= std[0]
        x[..., 1] /= std[1]
        x[..., 2] /= std[2]
        
        return x

    if data_format == 'channels_first':
        # 'RGB'->'BGR'
        if x.ndim == 4:
            x = x[:, ::-1, ...]
        else:
            x = x[:, ::-1]
    else:
        # 'RGB'->'BGR'
        x = x[..., ::-1]
        
    # Zero-center by mean pixel
    mean = [103.939, 116.779, 123.68]
    x[..., 0] -= mean[0]
    x[..., 1] -= mean[1]
    x[..., 2] -= mean[2]

    return x
``` 

By following these corrections, the function should now correctly preprocess the input array based on the `mode` and `data_format` parameters.
