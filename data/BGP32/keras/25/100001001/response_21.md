The bug in the `_preprocess_numpy_input` function lies in the block of code that handles the 'caffe' mode. In the 'caffe' mode case, the function doesn't handle the mean subtraction step and directly returns the input array `x`.

To fix this bug, we need to apply the correct preprocessing steps for the 'caffe' mode, which involves converting RGB to BGR and zero-centering each color channel with respect to the ImageNet dataset.

Here's the corrected version of the `_preprocess_numpy_input` function:

```python
def _preprocess_numpy_input(x, data_format, mode):
    """Preprocesses a Numpy array encoding a batch of images.

    # Arguments
        x: Input array, 3D or 4D.
        data_format: Data format of the image array.
        mode: One of "caffe", "tf" or "torch".
            - caffe: will convert the images from RGB to BGR,
                then will zero-center each color channel with
                respect to the ImageNet dataset,
                without scaling.
            - tf: will scale pixels between -1 and 1,
                sample-wise.
            - torch: will scale pixels between 0 and 1 and then
                will normalize each channel with respect to the
                ImageNet dataset.

    # Returns
        Preprocessed Numpy array.
    """
    if mode == 'tf':
        x /= 127.5
        x -= 1.
        return x

    if mode == 'torch':
        x /= 255.
        mean = [0.485, 0.456, 0.406]
        std = [0.229, 0.224, 0.225]

        # Zero-center by mean pixel
        for i in range(3):
            x[..., i] -= mean[i]
            if std is not None:
                x[..., i] /= std[i]
    elif mode == 'caffe':
        if data_format == 'channels_first':
            # 'RGB'->'BGR'
            if x.ndim == 3:
                x = x[::-1, ...]
            else:
                x = x[:, ::-1, ...]
        else:
            # 'RGB'->'BGR'
            x = x[..., ::-1]
        mean = [103.939, 116.779, 123.68]

        # Zero-center by mean pixel
        for i in range(3):
            x[..., i] -= mean[i]

    return x
```

This corrected version now correctly handles the 'caffe' mode by converting RGB to BGR and zero-centering the input array `x` based on the ImageNet dataset mean values.
