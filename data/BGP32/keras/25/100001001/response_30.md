### Explanation:
The bug in the `_preprocess_numpy_input` function occurs when the `mode` is not 'tf' or 'torch' and the `data_format` is 'channels_last'. In this case, the function is supposed to convert the input array from RGB to BGR, but the conversion is not being done correctly due to a mistake in the channel conversion logic.

### Bug Fix:
To fix the bug, we need to correct the channel conversion logic when `data_format` is 'channels_last' and `mode` is not 'tf' or 'torch'. Specifically, the channel order needs to be reversed correctly for each image in the batch.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def _preprocess_numpy_input(x, data_format, mode):
    """Preprocesses a Numpy array encoding a batch of images.

    # Arguments
        x: Input array, 3D or 4D.
        data_format: Data format of the image array.
        mode: One of "caffe", "tf", or "torch".
            - caffe: will convert the images from RGB to BGR,
                then will zero-center each color channel with
                respect to the ImageNet dataset,
                without scaling.
            - tf: will scale pixels between -1 and 1,
                sample-wise.
            - torch: will scale pixels between 0 and 1 and then
                will normalize each channel with respect to the
                ImageNet dataset.

    # Returns
        Preprocessed Numpy array.
