## Bug Analysis
The bug occurs when the `mode` is not `'tf'` or `'torch'` and the `data_format` is `'channels_last'`. In this case, the function tries to apply the mean subtraction and division by standard deviation operations on the input array `x` without considering the dimensions properly, leading to incorrect preprocessing.

## Bug Explanation
In the provided buggy function, when `mode` is not `'tf'` or `'torch'` and `data_format` is `'channels_last'`, the code mistakenly assumes that `x` has its channels represented as the last dimension. However, the input `x` has the channels represented as the last dimension, which results in the wrong indices being used for the mean subtraction.

## Bug Fix
To fix this bug, we need to handle the mean subtraction and division by standard deviation operations differently based on the number of dimensions of the input array `x`. Additionally, we need to consider the correct channel indices when operating on the array.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _preprocess_numpy_input(x, data_format, mode):
    """Preprocesses a Numpy array encoding a batch of images.

    # Arguments
        x: Input array, 3D or 4D.
        data_format: Data format of the image array.
        mode: One of "caffe", "tf" or "torch".
            - caffe: will convert the images from RGB to BGR,
                then will zero-center each color channel with
                respect to the ImageNet dataset,
                without scaling.
            - tf: will scale pixels between -1 and 1,
                sample-wise.
            - torch: will scale pixels between 0 and 1 and then
                will normalize each channel with respect to the
                ImageNet dataset.

    # Returns
        Preprocessed Numpy array.
    """
    if mode == 'tf':
        x /= 127.5
        x -= 1.
        return x

    if mode == 'torch':
        x /= 255.
        mean = [0.485, 0.456, 0.406]
        std = [0.229, 0.224, 0.225]
    else:
        if data_format == 'channels_first':
            # 'RGB'->'BGR'
            if x.ndim == 3:
                x = x[::-1, ...]
            else:
                x = x[:, :, ::-1]
        else:
            # 'RGB'->'BGR'
            x = x[..., ::-1]
        mean = [103.939, 116.779, 123.68]
        std = None

    # Zero-center by mean pixel
    if x.ndim == 3:
        x -= mean
        if std is not None:
            x /= std
    else:  # Assuming 4D input
        x -= mean
        if std is not None:
            x /= std

    return x
```

With this corrected version, the function now properly handles the preprocessing of the input array, considering the correct channel indices and dimensions.
