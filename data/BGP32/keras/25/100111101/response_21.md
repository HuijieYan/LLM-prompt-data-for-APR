The bug in the `_preprocess_numpy_input` function arises due to a data type mismatch when subtracting the `mean` values from the input array `x`. The function attempts to subtract `float64` values from an `int32` array in some scenarios, leading to a casting error.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that all operations are performed on arrays of the same data type. We can achieve this by explicitly converting the `mean` values to the same data type as the input array `x` before performing subtraction.

Here is the corrected version of the `_preprocess_numpy_input` function:

```python
def _preprocess_numpy_input(x, data_format, mode):
    """Preprocesses a Numpy array encoding a batch of images.

    # Arguments
        x: Input array, 3D or 4D.
        data_format: Data format of the image array.
        mode: One of "caffe", "tf" or "torch".
            - caffe: will convert the images from RGB to BGR,
                then will zero-center each color channel with
                respect to the ImageNet dataset,
                without scaling.
            - tf: will scale pixels between -1 and 1,
                sample-wise.
            - torch: will scale pixels between 0 and 1 and then
                will normalize each channel with respect to the
                ImageNet dataset.

    # Returns
        Preprocessed Numpy array.
    """
    x = x.astype('float32')  # Convert x to float32 to ensure compatibility with mean values

    if mode == 'tf':
        x /= 127.5
        x -= 1.
        return x

    if mode == 'torch':
        x /= 255.
        mean = [0.485, 0.456, 0.406]
        std = [0.229, 0.224, 0.225]
    else:
        if data_format == 'channels_first':
            # 'RGB'->'BGR'
            if x.ndim == 3:
                x = x[:, ::-1, ...]
            else:
                x = x[:, :, ::-1, ...]
        else:
            # 'RGB'->'BGR'
            x = x[..., ::-1]
        mean = [103.939, 116.779, 123.68]
        std = None

    # Zero-center by mean pixel
    x -= np.array(mean, dtype='float32')  # Subtract mean values after explicit conversion
    if std is not None:
        x /= np.array(std, dtype='float32')  # Normalize by std values after explicit conversion

    return x
```

With this correction, the function now explicitly converts the `mean` values to `float32` before subtracting them from the input array `x`. This ensures that both `x` and the `mean` values are of the same data type, preventing casting errors.
