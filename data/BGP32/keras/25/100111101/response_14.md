### Bug Explanation:
The bug occurs due to the type mismatch in the calculation between a `float64` value and an `int32` value when subtracting the mean values from the input array `x`. This type mismatch triggers the error `UFuncTypeError`.

### Bug Fix:
To fix the bug, ensure that all mathematical operations are performed using the same data type across the code. Here, when subtracting mean values from input data, ensure that the resulting array has the same data type as the input data to avoid type inconsistencies.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
import numpy as np

def _preprocess_numpy_input(x, data_format, mode):
    if mode == 'tf':
        x /= 127.5
        x -= 1.
        return x

    x = x.astype(np.float32)  # Convert to float32 to handle type consistency

    if mode == 'torch':
        x /= 255.
        mean = [0.485, 0.456, 0.406]
        std = [0.229, 0.224, 0.225]
    elif data_format == 'channels_first':
        if x.ndim == 3:
            x[0, :, :] -= mean[0]
            x[1, :, :] -= mean[1]
            x[2, :, :] -= mean[2]
            if std is not None:
                x[0, :, :] /= std[0]
                x[1, :, :] /= std[1]
                x[2, :, :] /= std[2]
        else:
            x[:, 0, :, :] -= mean[0]
            x[:, 1, :, :] -= mean[1]
            x[:, 2, :, :] -= mean[2]
            if std is not None:
                x[:, 0, :, :] /= std[0]
                x[:, 1, :, :] /= std[1]
                x[:, 2, :, :] /= std[2]
    else:
        x[..., 0] -= mean[0]
        x[..., 1] -= mean[1]
        x[..., 2] -= mean[2]
        if std is not None:
            x[..., 0] /= std[0]
            x[..., 1] /= std[1]
            x[..., 2] /= std[2]
    
    return x
```

Make sure you have defined the `mean` and `std` arrays appropriately before calling this updated function. This corrected version should now handle the data type consistency issue and pass the failing test cases.
