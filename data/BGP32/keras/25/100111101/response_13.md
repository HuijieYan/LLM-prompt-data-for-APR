### Bug Analysis
The bug is caused by the function `_preprocess_numpy_input` not handling different data formats ('channels_first' and 'channels_last') correctly. This results in a type error when trying to perform subtraction on the input data, leading to a `UFuncTypeError`.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the function correctly handles both data formats ('channels_first' and 'channels_last') and performs the required preprocessing steps accordingly.

### Corrected Function
```python
def _preprocess_numpy_input(x, data_format, mode):
    if mode == 'tf':
        x /= 127.5
        x -= 1.
        return x

    if mode == 'torch':
        x /= 255.
        mean = [0.485, 0.456, 0.406]
        std = [0.229, 0.224, 0.225]
    else:
        if data_format == 'channels_first':
            if x.ndim == 4:
                x[:, 0] -= mean[0]
                x[:, 1] -= mean[1]
                x[:, 2] -= mean[2]
                if std is not None:
                    x[:, 0] /= std[0]
                    x[:, 1] /= std[1]
                    x[:, 2] /= std[2]
            else:
                x[..., 0] -= mean[0]
                x[..., 1] -= mean[1]
                x[..., 2] -= mean[2]
                if std is not None:
                    x[..., 0] /= std[0]
                    x[..., 1] /= std[1]
                    x[..., 2] /= std[2]
        else:
            # 'RGB'->'BGR'
            x[..., ::-1] -= mean
            if std is not None:
                x[..., 0] /= std[0]
                x[..., 1] /= std[1]
                x[..., 2] /= std[2]

    return x
```

By using this corrected function, the bug causing the `UFuncTypeError` should be fixed, and the function should now handle both data formats correctly. This revised version should pass the failing test cases provided.
