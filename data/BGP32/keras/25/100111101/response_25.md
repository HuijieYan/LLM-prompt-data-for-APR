### Bug Explanation
The bug occurs when `mode = 'caffe'` and the `data_format = 'channels_first'`. In this case, when trying to perform a subtraction operation `x[..., 0] -= mean[0]`, the numpy array `x` is of type int32, while `mean[0]` is a float value. This results in a type mismatch error, leading to the failure of the test.

### Bug Fix
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the data types of the variables involved in the subtraction operations match. We should convert the array `x` to float before performing the subtraction operations.

### Corrected Function
Here is the corrected version of the `_preprocess_numpy_input` function:

```python
def _preprocess_numpy_input(x, data_format, mode):
    if mode == 'tf':
        x /= 127.5
        x -= 1.
        return x

    if mode == 'torch':
        x /= 255.
        mean = [0.485, 0.456, 0.406]
        std = [0.229, 0.224, 0.225]
    else:
        if data_format == 'channels_first':
            if x.ndim == 3:
                x = x[::-1, ...].astype(float)
            else:
                x = x[:, ::-1, ...].astype(float)
        else:
            x = x[..., ::-1].astype(float)
        mean = [103.939, 116.779, 123.68]
        std = None

    if data_format == 'channels_first':
        if x.ndim == 3:
            x[0, :, :] -= mean[0]
            x[1, :, :] -= mean[1]
            x[2, :, :] -= mean[2]
            if std is not None:
                x[0, :, :] /= std[0]
                x[1, :, :] /= std[1]
                x[2, :, :] /= std[2]
        else:
            x[:, 0, :, :] -= mean[0]
            x[:, 1, :, :] -= mean[1]
            x[:, 2, :, :] -= mean[2]
            if std is not None:
                x[:, 0, :, :] /= std[0]
                x[:, 1, :, :] /= std[1]
                x[:, 2, :, :] /= std[2]
    else:
        x[..., 0] -= mean[0]
        x[..., 1] -= mean[1]
        x[..., 2] -= mean[2]
        if std is not None:
            x[..., 0] /= std[0]
            x[..., 1] /= std[1]
            x[..., 2] /= std[2]

    return x
```

With this correction, the function will now correctly handle the data types, ensuring that the subtraction operations can be performed without any type mismatch issues.
