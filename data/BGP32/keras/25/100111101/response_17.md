### Bug Explanation:
The bug occurs due to a type mismatch error when trying to apply arithmetic operations on an ndarray that contains float values alongside an ndarray with int32 values. Specifically, when attempting to subtract the `mean` list (which is composed of float values) from the `x` ndarray that contains int32 values, a type conversion error arises, leading to the failed test.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix this bug, we need to ensure that all numerical operations involving the `x` array respect the same data type. One approach is to unify the data type throughout the calculations by converting the `x` array to float before applying arithmetic operations. This way, we avoid type mismatches and maintain consistency in the calculations.

### Updated Corrected Function:
```python
def _preprocess_numpy_input(x, data_format, mode):
    """Preprocesses a Numpy array encoding a batch of images.

    # Arguments
        x: Input array, 3D or 4D.
        data_format: Data format of the image array.
        mode: One of "caffe", "tf" or "torch".
            - caffe: will convert the images from RGB to BGR,
                then will zero-center each color channel with
                respect to the ImageNet dataset,
                without scaling.
            - tf: will scale pixels between -1 and 1,
                sample-wise.
            - torch: will scale pixels between 0 and 1 and then
                will normalize each channel with respect to the
                ImageNet dataset.

    # Returns
        Preprocessed Numpy array.

By converting `x` to float32 at the beginning of the function, we have resolved the type mismatch issue, ensuring that all subsequent operations maintain a consistent data type, leading to successful preprocessing of the input arrays.
