### Bug Explanation:
The bug in the `_preprocess_numpy_input` function lies in how the operations are applied to the input variable `x`. The problem occurs when trying to subtract mean values from the input array `x` which has a datatype of `int32`. Subtraction with mean values causes the resulting output to be in `float64`, which cannot be cast back to `int32` during in-place subtraction.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the input array `x` is converted to a floating-point type before performing the mean subtraction operation. This will allow the calculations to remain in floating-point precision and avoid the casting issues.

### Code Fix:
```python
import numpy as np

def _preprocess_numpy_input(x, data_format, mode):
    """Preprocesses a Numpy array encoding a batch of images.

    # Arguments
        x: Input array, 3D or 4D.
        data_format: Data format of the image array.
        mode: One of "caffe", "tf" or "torch".
            - caffe: will convert the images from RGB to BGR,
                then will zero-center each color channel with
                respect to the ImageNet dataset,
                without scaling.
            - tf: will scale pixels between -1 and 1,
                sample-wise.
            - torch: will scale pixels between 0 and 1 and then
                will normalize each channel with respect to the
                ImageNet dataset.

    # Returns
        Preprocessed Numpy array.
    """
    x = x.astype(np.float32)  # Convert input to float32

    if mode == 'tf':
        x /= 127.5
        x -= 1.
        return x

    if mode == 'torch':
        x /= 255.

        std = [0.229, 0.224, 0.225]
    else:
        if data_format == 'channels_first':
            # 'RGB'->'BGR'

            x = x[..., ::-1]

        std = None

    # Zero-center by mean pixel
    if data_format == 'channels_first':
        if x.ndim == 3:
            x[0, :, :] -= mean[0]
            x[1, :, :] -= mean[1]
            x[2, :, :] -= mean[2]
            if std is not None:
                x[0, :, :] /= std[0]
                x[1, :, :] /= std[1]
                x[2, :, :] /= std[2]
        else:

                x[:, 2, :, :] /= std[2]
    else:
        x[..., 0] -= mean[0]
        x[..., 1] -= mean[1]
        x[..., 2] -= mean[2]
        if std is not None:
            x[..., 0] /= std[0]
            x[..., 1] /= std[1]

    return x
``` 

By converting the input `x` to float32 at the beginning of the function, we avoid the casting errors during the mean subtraction and ensure that the calculations are done with floating-point precision. This fix should resolve the bug and make the function work correctly for the failing test cases.
