### Bug Explanation:
The bug occurs in the `_preprocess_numpy_input` function when trying to subtract the `mean` value from the input `x`. The error message indicates a `UFuncTypeError` stating that it cannot cast the output from `dtype('float64')` to `dtype('int32')`. This error occurs because the function is performing a subtraction operation between a float value (`mean`) and an integer array (`x`) resulting in a mixed-type operation that numpy does not support directly.

### Bug Fix:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the `mean` values are broadcasted appropriately when subtracting them from the input array `x`.

### Updated Corrected Function:
```python
def _preprocess_numpy_input(x, data_format, mode):
    if mode == 'tf':
        x /= 127.5
        x -= 1.
        return x

    if mode == 'torch':
        x /= 255.
        mean = [0.485, 0.456, 0.406]
        std = [0.229, 0.224, 0.225]
    else:
        if data_format == 'channels_first':
            if x.ndim == 3:
                x = x - np.array(mean)[:, None, None]
            else:
                x = x - np.array(mean)[..., None, None]
        else:
            x = x - np.array(mean)[None, None, ...]

        std = None

    if std is not None:
        x /= std

    return x
```

This corrected version of the function should handle the subtraction operation correctly for both float `mean` values and integer input arrays without casting errors. This fix should resolve the issue and allow the failing test cases to pass successfully.
