### Bug Explanation:
The bug occurs due to an incorrect data type mismatch in the computation of subtracting the mean values from the input tensor `x`. The error message indicates that the subtraction operation from a dtype('float64') to a dtype('int32') is causing a `UFuncTypeError`.

The issue arises when the function is operating with integer input values and then attempts to subtract the floating mean values (stored in the 'mean' list) from the input tensor 'x'. This triggers unintentional type casting from integer to float, leading to the error during the subtraction operation.

### Solution Strategy:
To resolve the bug, we need to ensure that all calculations are performed within the same data type. We should either convert the input tensor 'x' to floating-point values at the beginning of the function or adjust the mean values to integers if the input tensor 'x' remains as integers.

### Corrected Function:
```python
import numpy as np

def _preprocess_numpy_input(x, data_format, mode):
    """Preprocesses a Numpy array encoding a batch of images.

    # Arguments
        x: Input array, 3D or 4D.
        data_format: Data format of the image array.
        mode: One of "caffe", "tf" or "torch".
            - caffe: will convert the images from RGB to BGR,
                then will zero-center each color channel with
                respect to the ImageNet dataset,
                without scaling.
            - tf: will scale pixels between -1 and 1,
                sample-wise.
            - torch: will scale pixels between 0 and 1 and then
                will normalize each channel with respect to the
                ImageNet dataset.

    # Returns
        Preprocessed Numpy array.
    """
    x = x.astype('float32')  # Convert input to float to prevent type errors

    if mode == 'tf':
        x /= 127.5
        x -= 1.
        return x

    if mode == 'torch':
        x /= 255.
        mean = np.array([0.485, 0.456, 0.406], dtype=np.float32)
        std = np.array([0.229, 0.224, 0.225], dtype=np.float32)
    else:
        if data_format == 'channels_first':
            # 'RGB'->'BGR'
            if x.ndim == 3:
                x = x[:, ::-1, ...]
            else:
                x = x[:, :, ::-1, ...]
        else:
            # 'RGB'->'BGR'
            x = x[..., ::-1]
        mean = np.array([103.939, 116.779, 123.68], dtype=np.float32)
        std = None

    # Zero-center by mean pixel
    if data_format == 'channels_first':
        x -= mean.reshape((1, 3, 1, 1))
        if std is not None:
            x /= std.reshape((1, 3, 1, 1))
    else:
        x -= mean
        if std is not None:
            x /= std

    return x
```

By converting the input to float values at the beginning of the function and adjusting the mean values to float arrays, we ensure consistent data types throughout the calculations and prevent the type mismatch error.
