### Bug Explanation:
The bug occurs when the function tries to subtract the `mean` values from the `x` array. The error message indicates a `UFuncTypeError` stating that it cannot cast the subtraction output from `float64` to `int32`. This occurs because the `x` input is of type `int32` and the `mean` values are `float64`. Since the mean subtraction involves float values, it results in a different data type (`float64`), leading to the casting error when trying to store it back in an `int32` array.

### Bug fix strategy:
To fix this bug, the input array (`x`) should undergo appropriate type casting to match the data type of the `mean` values. We should convert the `x` array to a float type before performing the subtraction operation to ensure that the resulting array is of the same type (`float32`) and does not cause casting issues when storing the values back.

### Corrected Function:
```python
import numpy as np

def _preprocess_numpy_input(x, data_format, mode):
    """Preprocesses a Numpy array encoding a batch of images.

    # Arguments
        x: Input array, 3D or 4D.
        data_format: Data format of the image array.
        mode: One of "caffe", "tf" or "torch".
            - caffe: will convert the images from RGB to BGR,
                then will zero-center each color channel with
                respect to the ImageNet dataset,
                without scaling.
            - tf: will scale pixels between -1 and 1,
                sample-wise.
            - torch: will scale pixels between 0 and 1 and then
                will normalize each channel with respect to the
                ImageNet dataset.

    # Returns
        Preprocessed Numpy array.

By converting the input array `x` to `float32` data type as the first step in the function, we ensure that all subsequent operations maintain consistency in data types, eliminating the casting error that caused the bug.
