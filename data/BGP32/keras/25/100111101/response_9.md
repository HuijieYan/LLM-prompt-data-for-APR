### Bug Explanation:

The bug occurs due to the mismatch in data types during the subtraction operation in the `_preprocess_numpy_input` function. The error message indicates that the function is trying to subtract a `float64` value from an `int32` array, which causes a `UFuncTypeError`.

Looking at the implementation, the problematic code is `x[..., 0] -= mean[0]`. In this line, if the `x` array has an integer dtype (like in the failing test case with `xint`), it leads to type mismatch during the subtraction operation with a `float64` value from `mean`. This results in the error.

### Fix Strategy:

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the data type of the input array `x` matches the data type of the constants (`mean` and `std`) being subtracted from it. We can achieve this by converting the `x` array to `float32` before performing the operations.

### Corrected Version of the Function:

```python
def _preprocess_numpy_input(x, data_format, mode):
    if mode == 'tf':
        x = x.astype('float32')  # Convert x to float32
        x /= 127.5
        x -= 1.
        return x

    if mode == 'torch':
        x = x.astype('float32')  # Convert x to float32
        x /= 255.
        mean = [0.485, 0.456, 0.406]
        std = [0.229, 0.224, 0.225]
    else:
        if data_format == 'channels_first':
            if x.ndim == 3:
                x = x[::-1, ...]
            else:
                x = x[:, ::-1, ...]
        else:
            x = x[..., ::-1]
        mean = [103.939, 116.779, 123.68]
        std = None

    if x.dtype != np.float32:
        x = x.astype('float32')  # Convert x to float32

    if data_format == 'channels_first':
        if x.ndim == 3:
            x[0, :, :] -= mean[0]
            x[1, :, :] -= mean[1]
            x[2, :, :] -= mean[2]
            if std is not None:
                x[0, :, :] /= std[0]
                x[1, :, :] /= std[1]
                x[2, :, :] /= std[2]
        else:
            x[:, 0, :, :] -= mean[0]
            x[:, 1, :, :] -= mean[1]
            x[:, 2, :, :] -= mean[2]
            if std is not None:
                x[:, 0, :, :] /= std[0]
                x[:, 1, :, :] /= std[1]
                x[:, 2, :, :] /= std[2]
    else:
        x[..., 0] -= mean[0]
        x[..., 1] -= mean[1]
        x[..., 2] -= mean[2]
        if std is not None:
            x[..., 0] /= std[0]
            x[..., 1] /= std[1]
            x[..., 2] /= std[2]
    return x
``` 

This corrected version of the function explicitly converts `x` to `float32` wherever necessary to ensure uniform data types during arithmetic operations.
