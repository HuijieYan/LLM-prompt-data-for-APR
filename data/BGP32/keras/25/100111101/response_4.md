The bug in the `_preprocess_numpy_input` function occurs due to a mismatch in data types during the computation involving the mean array and the input array `x`. The error arises because the mean values are of type `float` while the input array, in some cases, is of type `int32`, causing a `UFuncTypeError` when trying to perform subtraction.

To fix this bug, we need to ensure that all operations are conducted consistently in the same data type. One way to address this is by converting the input array `x` to the same data type as the mean values before performing the arithmetic operations.

Here is the corrected version of the `_preprocess_numpy_input` function:

```python
def _preprocess_numpy_input(x, data_format, mode):
    """Preprocesses a Numpy array encoding a batch of images.

    # Arguments
        x: Input array, 3D or 4D.
        data_format: Data format of the image array.
        mode: One of "caffe", "tf" or "torch".
            - caffe: will convert the images from RGB to BGR,
                then will zero-center each color channel with
                respect to the ImageNet dataset,
                without scaling.
            - tf: will scale pixels between -1 and 1,
                sample-wise.
            - torch: will scale pixels between 0 and 1 and then
                will normalize each channel with respect to the
                ImageNet dataset.

    # Returns
        Preprocessed Numpy array.
    """
    if mode == 'tf':
        x = x.astype('float32')
        x /= 127.5
        x -= 1.
        return x

    if mode == 'torch':
        x = x.astype('float32')
        x /= 255.
        mean = [0.485, 0.456, 0.406]
        std = [0.229, 0.224, 0.225]

                x = x[::-1, ...]
            else:
                x = x[:, ::-1, ...]

        if x.ndim == 3:
            x[0, :, :] -= mean[0]
            x[1, :, :] -= mean[1]
            x[2, :, :] -= mean[2]
            if std is not None:
                x[0, :, :] /= std[0]
                x[1, :, :] /= std[1]

            x[..., 1] /= std[1]

    return x
```

This correction ensures that the input array `x` is always converted to type `float32` before any arithmetic calculations to avoid type inconsistencies that lead to the error. By uniformly handling the data types, the corrected function should now pass the failing test cases.
