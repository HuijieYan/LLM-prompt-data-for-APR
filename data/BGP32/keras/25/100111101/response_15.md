The bug in the `_preprocess_numpy_input` function is due to a type mismatch when subtracting the mean values from the input array `x`. The mean values are stored as floats, causing a UFuncTypeError when trying to subtract them from elements in `x` which are of type int32.

To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the mean values are converted to the same data type as the input array `x` before performing the subtraction.

Here is the corrected version of the `_preprocess_numpy_input` function:

```python
def _preprocess_numpy_input(x, data_format, mode):
    """Preprocesses a Numpy array encoding a batch of images.

    # Arguments
        x: Input array, 3D or 4D.
        data_format: Data format of the image array.
        mode: One of "caffe", "tf" or "torch".
            - caffe: will convert the images from RGB to BGR,
                then will zero-center each color channel with
                respect to the ImageNet dataset,
                without scaling.
            - tf: will scale pixels between -1 and 1,
                sample-wise.
            - torch: will scale pixels between 0 and 1 and then
                will normalize each channel with respect to the
                ImageNet dataset.

    # Returns
        Preprocessed Numpy array.
    """
    if mode == 'tf':
        x /= 127.5
        x -= 1.
        return x

    if mode == 'torch':
        x = x.astype('float32')
        x /= 255.
        mean = np.array([0.485, 0.456, 0.406], dtype=np.float32)
        std = np.array([0.229, 0.224, 0.225], dtype=np.float32)
    else:
        if data_format == 'channels_first':
            # 'RGB'->'BGR'
            if x.ndim == 3:
                x = x[::-1, ...]
            else:
                x = x[:, ::-1, ...]
        else:
            # 'RGB'->'BGR'
            x = x[..., ::-1]
        mean = np.array([103.939, 116.779, 123.68], dtype=np.float32)
        std = None

    # Zero-center by mean pixel
    if data_format == 'channels_first':
        if x.ndim == 3:
            for i in range(x.shape[0]):
                x[i, :, :] -= mean[i]
                if std is not None:
                    x[i, :, :] /= std[i]
        else:
            for i in range(x.shape[0]):
                x[:, i, :, :] -= mean[i]
                if std is not None:
                    x[:, i, :, :] /= std[i]
    else:
        for i in range(x.shape[-1]):
            x[..., i] -= mean[i]
            if std is not None:
                x[..., i] /= std[i]
    return x
```

This corrected version ensures that the mean values are treated as float32 and performs the subtraction without any type mismatches. This should resolve the UFuncTypeError and make the failing tests pass.
