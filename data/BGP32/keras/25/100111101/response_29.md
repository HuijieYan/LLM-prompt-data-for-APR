### Bug Explanation
The bug occurs when the function is trying to subtract the mean value from the input array `x` without converting it to floating-point values. Since the input values are integers, the subtraction operation results in a mixed data type operation which triggers the error: `Cannot cast ufunc 'subtract' output from dtype('float64') to dtype('int32')`.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To address this bug, we need to ensure that all operations inside the function are done on floating-point values. This can be achieved by converting the input array `x` to a floating-point array before performing any operations on it.

### Corrected Function
```python
import numpy as np

def _preprocess_numpy_input(x, data_format, mode):
    """Preprocesses a Numpy array encoding a batch of images.

    # Arguments
        x: Input array, 3D or 4D.
        data_format: Data format of the image array.
        mode: One of "caffe", "tf" or "torch".
            - caffe: will convert the images from RGB to BGR,
                then will zero-center each color channel with
                respect to the ImageNet dataset,
                without scaling.
            - tf: will scale pixels between -1 and 1,
                sample-wise.
            - torch: will scale pixels between 0 and 1 and then
                will normalize each channel with respect to the
                ImageNet dataset.

    # Returns
        Preprocessed Numpy array.
    """
    # Convert input array to float32 to prevent mixed data type operations
    x = x.astype('float32')

    if mode == 'tf':
        x /= 127.5
        x -= 1.
        return x

    if mode == 'torch':
        x /= 255.
        mean = [0.485, 0.456, 0.406]
        std = [0.229, 0.224, 0.225]
    else:
        if data_format == 'channels_first':
            # 'RGB'->'BGR'
            x = x[:, ::-1, ...]  # Faster than x = x[:, :, ::-1, ...]
        else:
            # 'RGB'->'BGR'
            x = x[..., ::-1]
        mean = [103.939, 116.779, 123.68]
        std = None

    # Zero-center by mean pixel
    x -= np.array(mean)

    if std is not None:
        x /= np.array(std)

    return x
```

With this correction, the function properly handles the input arrays and performs the required operations in a way that avoids mixed data type errors. This should resolve the issue encountered in the failing test case.
