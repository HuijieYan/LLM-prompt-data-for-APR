## Analysis:
The provided `_preprocess_numpy_input` function is meant to preprocess a Numpy array encoding a batch of images based on the specified `mode` and `data_format`. The bug in this function seems to be related to handling the mode `'torch'` where it should scale pixels between 0 and 1 and then normalize each channel with respect to the ImageNet dataset. The logic for this mode is missing in the function, leading to failing tests.

## Bug:
The bug occurs in the condition where `mode` is `'torch'`. The function does not handle the normalization and standardization of the input array as expected for this mode.

## Fix:
To fix this bug, the logic for the `'torch'` mode should be implemented. This includes scaling pixels between 0 and 1, normalizing each channel with respect to the ImageNet dataset using the specified `mean` and `std` values.

## Updated Function:
```python
def _preprocess_numpy_input(x, data_format, mode):
    if mode == 'tf':
        x /= 127.5
        x -= 1.
        return x

    if mode == 'torch':
        x /= 255.
        mean = [0.485, 0.456, 0.406]
        std = [0.229, 0.224, 0.225]
        for i in range(3):
            x[..., i] -= mean[i]
            if std is not None:
                x[..., i] /= std[i]
        return x

    if data_format == 'channels_first':
        if x.ndim == 3:
            x[0, :, :] -= mean[0]
            x[1, :, :] -= mean[1]
            x[2, :, :] -= mean[2]
            if std is not None:
                x[0, :, :] /= std[0]
                x[1, :, :] /= std[1]
                x[2, :, :] /= std[2]
        else:
            x[:, 0, :, :] -= mean[0]
            x[:, 1, :, :] -= mean[1]
            x[:, 2, :, :] -= mean[2]
            if std is not None:
                x[:, 0, :, :] /= std[0]
                x[:, 1, :, :] /= std[1]
                x[:, 2, :, :] /= std[2]
    else:
        x[..., 0] -= mean[0]
        x[..., 1] -= mean[1]
        x[..., 2] -= mean[2]
        if std is not None:
            x[..., 0] /= std[0]
            x[..., 1] /= std[1]
            x[..., 2] /= std[2]
    return x
```

By updating the function with the correct logic for the `'torch'` mode, the tests should now pass successfully.
