## Analysis:
1. The `_preprocess_numpy_input` function is designed to preprocess a Numpy array encoding a batch of images based on the given `data_format` and `mode`.
2. The function has conditional statements based on the `mode`, where if it is 'tf', the normalization operation is performed differently compared to 'torch' or other modes.
3. The bug is likely in the normalization calculations based on the conditional `mode`.
4. The normalization calculation for 'torch' mode is incorrect, as it only calculates `mean` and `std` without applying any operations on `x`.

## Bug Cause:
The bug in the original `_preprocess_numpy_input` function lies in the 'torch' mode where the mean and std values are calculated but not applied to `x`, leading to incorrect preprocessing.

## Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, apply the mean and standard deviation normalization operations to the input array `x` when the mode is 'torch'.

## Corrected Version of `_preprocess_numpy_input` function:

```python
def _preprocess_numpy_input(x, data_format, mode):
    """Preprocesses a Numpy array encoding a batch of images.

    # Arguments
        x: Input array, 3D or 4D.
        data_format: Data format of the image array.
        mode: One of "caffe", "tf" or "torch".
            - caffe: will convert the images from RGB to BGR,
                then will zero-center each color channel with
                respect to the ImageNet dataset,
                without scaling.
            - tf: will scale pixels between -1 and 1,
                sample-wise.
            - torch: will scale pixels between 0 and 1 and then
                will normalize each channel with respect to the
                ImageNet dataset.

    # Returns
        Preprocessed Numpy array.

This corrected version of the `_preprocess_numpy_input` function should now correctly apply the mean and standard deviation normalization operations in the 'torch' mode, fixing the bug identified.
