The bug in the `_preprocess_numpy_input` function lies in the calculation of the mean and std values for the 'torch' mode. In the original function, the mean and std values are calculated and assigned to `mean` and `std` only when `mode` is 'torch'. However, the normalization step is missing in the 'torch' mode after calculating the mean and std values. This results in incorrect preprocessing of the input array.

To fix this bug, we need to add the normalization step after calculating the mean and std values in the 'torch' mode.

Here is the corrected version of the `_preprocess_numpy_input` function:

```python
# The corrected version of the function
def _preprocess_numpy_input(x, data_format, mode):
    """Preprocesses a Numpy array encoding a batch of images.

    # Arguments
        x: Input array, 3D or 4D.
        data_format: Data format of the image array.
        mode: One of "caffe", "tf" or "torch".
            - caffe: will convert the images from RGB to BGR,
                then will zero-center each color channel with
                respect to the ImageNet dataset,
                without scaling.
            - tf: will scale pixels between -1 and 1,
                sample-wise.
            - torch: will scale pixels between 0 and 1 and then
                will normalize each channel with respect to the
                ImageNet dataset.

    # Returns
        Preprocessed Numpy array.

By adding the normalization step after calculating the mean and std values in the 'torch' mode, the corrected function should now properly preprocess the input array as expected by the failing test.
