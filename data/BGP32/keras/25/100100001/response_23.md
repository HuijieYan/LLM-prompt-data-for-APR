## Analysis:
1. The `_preprocess_numpy_input` function preprocesses a numpy array of images based on the data format and mode specified.
2. The function applies different preprocessing steps based on the mode (`tf`, `torch`, or default).
3. The bug may be related to incorrect calculations or handling of mean and std values depending on the condition.
4. The failing test `test_preprocess_input` checks the preprocessing of images using different data formats (`channels_first`, `channels_last`) and modes (`tf`, `torch`).

## Bug:
The bug in the `_preprocess_numpy_input` function lies in the calculation of mean and std values based on the conditions for different modes. The current implementation may not handle all possible conditions correctly, leading to incorrect preprocessing of images and failing the test.

## Fix:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the calculation of mean and std values is done correctly for all modes and data formats. We also need to handle the preprocessing steps for different dimensions of the input array appropriately.

## Corrected Version:
```python
import numpy as np

def _preprocess_numpy_input(x, data_format, mode):
    if mode == 'tf':
        x /= 127.5
        x -= 1.
    elif mode == 'torch':
        x /= 255.
        mean = [0.485, 0.456, 0.406]
        std = [0.229, 0.224, 0.225]
        for i in range(3):
            x[..., i] -= mean[i]
            if std is not None:
                x[..., i] /= std[i]
    else:
        if data_format == 'channels_first':
            if x.ndim == 3:
                x = x[:, ::-1, ...]
            else:
                x = x[:, :, :, ::-1]
        else:
            x = x[..., ::-1]
        mean = [103.939, 116.779, 123.68]
        std = None
        for i in range(3):
            x[..., i] -= mean[i]
            if std is not None:
                x[..., i] /= std[i]
    
    return x

# Test the corrected function
x = np.random.uniform(0, 255, (2, 10, 10, 3))
out = _preprocess_numpy_input(x, 'channels_last', 'tf')
assert out.shape == x.shape
```

In the corrected version, the mean and std value calculations have been adjusted for different conditions and modes, ensuring that the image preprocessing is done correctly. The function now handles both 3D and 4D input arrays and different data formats (`channels_first`, `channels_last`) correctly.
