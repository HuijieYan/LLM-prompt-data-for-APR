## Analysis:
The buggy function `_preprocess_numpy_input` is responsible for preprocessing a Numpy array of images based on the given mode ('caffe', 'tf', or 'torch') and data format ('channels_first' or 'channels_last'). The bug seems to be related to the incorrect handling of the mean and std values based on the mode selected.

## Error Location:
The bug is likely in the incorrect computation of the mean and std values for the 'torch' mode. The mean and std values are supposed to be applied differently based on the selected mode, and the current implementation doesn't handle this correctly.

## Bug Explanation:
The bug occurs when the 'torch' mode is selected. The function incorrectly computes the mean and std for normalization, resulting in incorrect preprocessing of the input image array. This leads to a failed test case when comparing the output of the preprocessed input for 'torch' mode with expected values.

## Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, the mean and std values need to be calculated and applied correctly based on the mode selected. Ensure that the correct operations are performed for each mode ('caffe', 'tf', or 'torch') to preprocess the input array properly.

## Corrected Version:
```python
def _preprocess_numpy_input(x, data_format, mode):
    if mode == 'tf':
        x /= 127.5
        x -= 1.
        return x

    if mode == 'torch':
        x /= 255.
        mean = [0.485, 0.456, 0.406]
        std = [0.229, 0.224, 0.225]
    else:
        if data_format == 'channels_first':
            if x.ndim == 3:
                x = x[::-1, ...]
            else:
                x = x[:, ::-1, ...]
        else:
            x = x[..., ::-1]
        mean = [103.939, 116.779, 123.68]
        std = None

    if mode == 'torch':   
        if data_format == 'channels_first':
            x[0] -= mean[0]
            x[1] -= mean[1]
            x[2] -= mean[2]
            if std is not None:
                x[0] /= std[0]
                x[1] /= std[1]
                x[2] /= std[2]
        else:
            x[..., 0] -= mean[0]
            x[..., 1] -= mean[1]
            x[..., 2] -= mean[2]
            if std is not None:
                x[..., 0] /= std[0]
                x[..., 1] /= std[1]
                x[..., 2] /= std[2]            
    return x
```

By making these changes, the function should now correctly preprocess the input array based on the selected mode and format, passing the failing test and ensuring proper image preprocessing.
