## Analysis:
The `_preprocess_numpy_input` function is intended to preprocess a numpy array of images based on the provided `mode` and `data_format`. The bug lies in the preprocessing logic for the 'tf' mode. In this mode, the function should scale the pixels between -1 and 1 sample-wise but the current implementation is incorrect.

## Potential Error Locations:
1. Incorrect scaling logic in the 'tf' mode.
2. Incorrect conversion of channels format ('RGB' to 'BGR') based on the `data_format`.

## Cause of the Bug:
The bug is caused by the incorrect scaling logic in the 'tf' mode, where the function should scale pixels between -1 and 1 sample-wise. Due to this bug, the failing test case that checks for the correct preprocessing of input data fails.

## Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to adjust the scaling logic for the 'tf' mode so that it correctly scales the pixels between -1 and 1. Additionally, ensure that the conversion of channels format ('RGB' to 'BGR') is done correctly based on the `data_format`.

## Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def _preprocess_numpy_input(x, data_format, mode):
    """Preprocesses a Numpy array encoding a batch of images.

    # Arguments
        x: Input array, 3D or 4D.
        data_format: Data format of the image array.
        mode: One of "caffe", "tf" or "torch".
            - caffe: will convert the images from RGB to BGR,
                then will zero-center each color channel with
                respect to the ImageNet dataset,
                without scaling.
            - tf: will scale pixels between -1 and 1,
                sample-wise.
            - torch: will scale pixels between 0 and 1 and then
                will normalize each channel with respect to the
                ImageNet dataset.

    # Returns
        Preprocessed Numpy array.

By fixing the scaling logic in the 'tf' mode and adjusting the channels format conversion based on the `data_format`, the corrected version of the `_preprocess_numpy_input` function should pass the failing test case successfully.
