### Analysis:
The buggy function `_preprocess_numpy_input` is responsible for preprocessing input image arrays based on the specified `data_format` and `mode`. The bug seems to be related to how the function handles the input array `x` and applies the preprocessing steps.

### Potential Error Locations:
1. Incorrect handling of the `mode` parameter.
2. Incorrect calculation or normalization of the input array `x`.
3. Inconsistent processing based on `data_format`.

### Bug Explanation:
The bug seems to be related to the incorrect handling of the `mode` parameter. Specifically, when `mode == 'torch'`, the function sets the `mean` and `std` values, but it fails to normalize the input array `x` properly according to these values.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the input array `x` is correctly preprocessed based on the specified `mode` and `mean/std` values. This may involve adjusting the normalization calculations in the function.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
Here is the corrected version of the `_preprocess_numpy_input` function:

```python
def _preprocess_numpy_input(x, data_format, mode):
    if mode == 'tf':
        x /= 127.5
        x -= 1.
        return x

    if mode == 'torch':
        x /= 255.
        mean = [0.485, 0.456, 0.406]
        std = [0.229, 0.224, 0.225]
        for i in range(3):
            x[..., i] -= mean[i]
            x[..., i] /= std[i]
        return x

    if data_format == 'channels_first':
        # 'RGB'->'BGR'
        x = x[:, ::-1, ...]
        mean = [103.939, 116.779, 123.68]
    else:
        # 'RGB'->'BGR'
        x = x[..., ::-1]
        mean = [103.939, 116.779, 123.68]
    
    x -= mean
    return x
```

By making these adjustments in the function, we ensure that the input array `x` is preprocessed correctly based on the specified `mode` and `data_format`. This corrected version should pass the failing test.
