## Analysis:
1. The `_preprocess_numpy_input` function preprocesses a batch of images stored in a Numpy array based on the specified data format and mode.
2. The function applies different preprocessing steps according to the selected mode ('tf', 'torch', or others) and data format ('channels_first' or 'channels_last').
3. The bug seems to be related to incorrect handling of channel-wise mean subtraction and division by standard deviation for the 'torch' mode.

## Bug:
The bug occurs when the function is in 'torch' mode, where it should normalize each channel with respect to the ImageNet dataset using specific mean and standard deviation values. However, the implementation incorrectly performs mean subtraction and division by standard deviation for all channels, not each channel individually.

## Fix:
To fix the bug, we should modify the section of code related to channel-wise normalization for the 'torch' mode to correctly perform the normalization for each channel individually.

## Corrected Version of the Function:

```python
def _preprocess_numpy_input(x, data_format, mode):
    if mode == 'tf':
        x /= 127.5
        x -= 1.
        return x

    if mode == 'torch':
        x /= 255.
        mean = [0.485, 0.456, 0.406]
        std = [0.229, 0.224, 0.225]
        if data_format == 'channels_first':
            for i in range(3):
                x[i, :, :] -= mean[i]
                if std is not None:
                    x[i, :, :] /= std[i]
        else:
            for i in range(3):
                x[:, :, i] -= mean[i]
                if std is not None:
                    x[:, :, i] /= std[i]                    
    else:
        if data_format == 'channels_first':
            if x.ndim == 3:
                x = x[::-1, ...]
            else:
                x = x[:, ::-1, ...]
        else:
            x = x[..., ::-1]
        mean = [103.939, 116.779, 123.68]
        std = None

        if data_format == 'channels_first':
            x[0, :, :] -= mean[0]
            x[1, :, :] -= mean[1]
            x[2, :, :] -= mean[2]
            if std is not None:
                x[0, :, :] /= std[0]
                x[1, :, :] /= std[1]
                x[2, :, :] /= std[2]
        else:
            x[..., 0] -= mean[0]
            x[..., 1] -= mean[1]
            x[..., 2] -= mean[2]
            if std is not None:
                x[..., 0] /= std[0]
                x[..., 1] /= std[1]
                x[..., 2] /= std[2]
    return x
``` 

By correcting the channel-wise normalization for the 'torch' mode, the function should now pass the failing test case provided.
