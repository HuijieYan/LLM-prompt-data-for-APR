### Analysis:
- The function `_preprocess_numpy_input` is responsible for preprocessing a numpy array encoding a batch of images based on the provided arguments `mode` and `data_format`.
- The test function `test_preprocess_input` is used to test the preprocessing function with different inputs and configurations.

### Bug Location:
- The bug is likely located in the calculation and normalization parts of the function, specifically in the conditional blocks for different modes and data formats.

### Cause of the Bug:
- The bug occurs due to inconsistent normalization and channel swapping logic based on the provided `mode` and `data_format` arguments.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
- Ensure consistent processing logic for different modes and data formats.
- Adjust the mean and standard deviation calculations for different channels and formats.
- Normalize the input array properly based on the chosen mode.

### Corrected Function:
```python
import numpy as np

def _preprocess_numpy_input(x, data_format, mode):
    if mode == 'tf':
        x /= 127.5
        x -= 1.0
    elif mode == 'torch':
        x /= 255.0
        mean = np.array([0.485, 0.456, 0.406])
        std = np.array([0.229, 0.224, 0.225])
        x = (x - mean) / std
    else:
        mean = np.array([103.939, 116.779, 123.68])
        if data_format == 'channels_first':
            if x.ndim == 3:
                x[0] -= mean[0]
                x[1] -= mean[1]
                x[2] -= mean[2]
            else:
                x[:, 0] -= mean[0]
                x[:, 1] -= mean[1]
                x[:, 2] -= mean[2]
        else:
            x[..., 0] -= mean[0]
            x[..., 1] -= mean[1]
            x[..., 2] -= mean[2]

        std = None

    if std is not None:
        if data_format == 'channels_first':
            if x.ndim == 3:
                x[0] /= std[0]
                x[1] /= std[1]
                x[2] /= std[2]
            else:
                x[:, 0] /= std[0]
                x[:, 1] /= std[1]
                x[:, 2] /= std[2]
        else:
            x[..., 0] /= std[0]
            x[..., 1] /= std[1]
            x[..., 2] /= std[2]

    return x
```

This corrected version of the function should address the normalization and preprocessing issues. Make sure to test it with the provided failing test-cases to verify its correctness.
