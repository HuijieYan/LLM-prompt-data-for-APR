## Analysis:
1. The `_preprocess_numpy_input` function preprocesses input image arrays based on the given `data_format` and `mode`.
2. The function has conditional blocks for different preprocessing modes: 'tf', 'torch', and others.
3. The bug likely exists in the processing of mean and std values for the 'torch' mode, which could be causing the failing test.
4. The cause of the bug seems to be the incorrect calculation of mean and std values for the 'torch' mode, leading to incorrect preprocessing.

## Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Identify the correct mean and std values based on the new preprocessing requirements for the 'torch' mode.
2. Modify the calculation of mean and std values in the 'torch' mode block to align with the correct values.
3. Ensure that the mean centering and normalization are correctly applied for all channels in the image arrays.

## Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def _preprocess_numpy_input(x, data_format, mode):
    if mode == 'tf':
        x /= 127.5
        x -= 1.
        return x

    if mode == 'torch':
        x /= 255.
        mean = [0.485, 0.456, 0.406]  # Corrected mean values
        std = [0.229, 0.224, 0.225]    # Corrected std values
    else:
        if data_format == 'channels_first':
            if x.ndim == 3:
                x = x[::-1, ...]
            else:
                x = x[:, ::-1, ...]
        else:
            x = x[..., ::-1]
        mean = [103.939, 116.779, 123.68]
        std = None

    if data_format == 'channels_first':
        if x.ndim == 3:
            x[0, :, :] -= mean[0]
            x[1, :, :] -= mean[1]
            x[2, :, :] -= mean[2]
            if std is not None:
                x[0, :, :] /= std[0]
                x[1, :, :] /= std[1]
                x[2, :, :] /= std[2]
        else:
            x[:, 0, :, :] -= mean[0]
            x[:, 1, :, :] -= mean[1]
            x[:, 2, :, :] -= mean[2]
            if std is not None:
                x[:, 0, :, :] /= std[0]
                x[:, 1, :, :] /= std[1]
                x[:, 2, :, :] /= std[2]
    else:
        x[..., 0] -= mean[0]
        x[..., 1] -= mean[1]
        x[..., 2] -= mean[2]
        if std is not None:
            x[..., 0] /= std[0]
            x[..., 1] /= std[1]
            x[..., 2] /= std[2]
            
    return x
``` 

By correcting the mean and std values for the 'torch' mode in the function, it should resolve the bug and make the function pass the failing test.
