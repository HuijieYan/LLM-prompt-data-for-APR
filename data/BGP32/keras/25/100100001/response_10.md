### Analysis:
The `preprocess_input()` function takes an input array representing a batch of images and preprocesses it based on the specified `data_format` and `mode`. The function performs different preprocessing steps depending on the selected mode ('caffe', 'tf', 'torch').

### Identifying potential error locations:
1. The function performs different operations based on the mode value, but there seems to be an inconsistency in handling the 'caffe' mode.
2. Handling of data format ('channels_first' or 'channels_last') might introduce errors in indexing and calculations.

### Explanation of the bug:
The bug occurs when the mode is 'caffe' and the data format is not 'channels_first'. The function does not correctly handle the preprocessing steps for the 'caffe' mode in such cases, leading to incorrect results.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the 'caffe' mode preprocessing is correctly implemented for both 'channels_first' and 'channels_last' data formats. We can adjust the logic to handle the 'caffe' mode consistently and correctly for all scenarios.

### Corrected Function:
```python
import numpy as np

def _preprocess_numpy_input(x, data_format, mode):
    if mode == 'tf':
        x /= 127.5
        x -= 1.
        return x

    if mode == 'torch':
        x /= 255.
        mean = [0.485, 0.456, 0.406]
        std = [0.229, 0.224, 0.225]
    elif mode == 'caffe':
        if data_format == 'channels_first':
            x /= 255.
            mean = [0.485, 0.456, 0.406]
            std = [0.229, 0.224, 0.225]
        else:
            x = x[..., ::-1]
            x /= 255.
            mean = [0.485, 0.456, 0.406]
            std = [0.229, 0.224, 0.225]
    else:
        if data_format == 'channels_first':
            if x.ndim == 3:
                x = x[::-1, ...]
            else:
                x = x[:, ::-1, ...]
        else:
            x = x[..., ::-1]
        mean = [103.939, 116.779, 123.68]
        std = None

    if std is not None:
        if data_format == 'channels_first':
            x[0, :, :] -= mean[0]
            x[1, :, :] -= mean[1]
            x[2, :, :] -= mean[2]
            x[0, :, :] /= std[0]
            x[1, :, :] /= std[1]
            x[2, :, :] /= std[2]
        else:
            x[..., 0] -= mean[0]
            x[..., 1] -= mean[1]
            x[..., 2] -= mean[2]
            x[..., 0] /= std[0]
            x[..., 1] /= std[1]
            x[..., 2] /= std[2]
    else:
        if data_format == 'channels_first':
            x[0, :, :] -= mean[0]
            x[1, :, :] -= mean[1]
            x[2, :, :] -= mean[2]
        else:
            x[..., 0] -= mean[0]
            x[..., 1] -= mean[1]
            x[..., 2] -= mean[2]

    return x

```

After fixing the function as shown above, it should now handle the 'caffe' mode correctly for both 'channels_first' and 'channels_last' data formats. This corrected version should pass the failing test scenarios.
