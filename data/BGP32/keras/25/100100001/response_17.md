## Analysis:
- The buggy function `_preprocess_numpy_input` is responsible for preprocessing a Numpy array encoding a batch of images based on the specified data format and mode.
- The potential error locations within the function could be related to the conditional logic for different modes ('tf', 'torch', default).
- The failing test `test_preprocess_input` tests the preprocessing of input images using the `utils.preprocess_input` function.
- The failing test indicates that the current implementation of `_preprocess_numpy_input` is not correctly preprocessing the input images.

## Bug Cause:
The bug in the `_preprocess_numpy_input` function is that it does not handle the case when `mode` is not 'tf' or 'torch' correctly. The default case for 'caffe' is assumed to convert RGB to BGR and apply mean pixel normalization, but it is not done properly.

## Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the default case (for 'caffe') correctly applies the RGB to BGR conversion followed by mean pixel normalization. Additionally, we should ensure that the function handles all possible data formats ('channels_first' and 'channels_last') properly.

## Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
import numpy as np

def _preprocess_numpy_input(x, data_format, mode):
    if mode == 'tf':
        x /= 127.5
        x -= 1.
        return x

    if mode == 'torch':
        x /= 255.
        mean = [0.485, 0.456, 0.406]
        std = [0.229, 0.224, 0.225]
    else:
        if data_format == 'channels_first':
            if x.ndim == 3:
                # 'RGB'->'BGR'
                x = x[:, ::-1, ...]
            else:
                x = x[:, :, ::-1, ...]
        else:
            # 'RGB'->'BGR'
            x = x[..., ::-1]
        mean = [103.939, 116.779, 123.68]
        std = None

    # Zero-center by mean pixel
    if data_format == 'channels_first':
        x -= mean
        if std is not None:
            x /= std
    else:
        x -= mean
        if std is not None:
            x /= std

    return x

```

In the corrected version of the function, the default case for 'caffe' now correctly handles the RGB to BGR conversion and mean pixel normalization. Additionally, the function now properly handles both 'channels_first' and 'channels_last' data formats.
