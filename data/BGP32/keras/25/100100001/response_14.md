The bug in the `_preprocess_numpy_input` function arises from incorrect handling of the data_format parameter. In the original implementation, the function did not consider the data_format when calculating the mean and standard deviation values for normalization. This led to incorrect normalization and caused the failing test.

To fix the bug, we need to adjust the calculation of mean and standard deviation based on the data_format provided. Additionally, we need to ensure that the shape of the input array is properly handled in all cases.

Here is the corrected version of the `_preprocess_numpy_input` function:

```python
def _preprocess_numpy_input(x, data_format, mode):
    if mode == 'tf':
        x /= 127.5
        x -= 1.
        return x

    if mode == 'torch':
        x /= 255.
        mean = [0.485, 0.456, 0.406]
        std = [0.229, 0.224, 0.225]
    else:
        # Calculate mean and std based on data_format
        if data_format == 'channels_first':
            mean = [103.939, 116.779, 123.68]
            std = None
            x = x[:, ::-1, ...]  # 'RGB' -> 'BGR'
        else:
            mean = [103.939, 116.779, 123.68]
            std = None
            x = x[..., ::-1]  # 'RGB' -> 'BGR'

    # Zero-center by mean pixel
    if std is not None:
        x -= mean
        x /= std
    else:
        x -= mean

    return x
```

This corrected version takes into account the data_format provided and adjusts the mean and standard deviation calculation accordingly. By making these changes, the function should now pass the failing test.
