### Analysis:
1. The function `_preprocess_numpy_input` takes an input array `x`, data format, and a mode as arguments.
2. Depending on the mode ('tf', 'torch', or default), it preprocesses the input array differently by either scaling the values, rearranging channels, or subtracting mean values.
3. The bug appears to be related to handling different data formats ('channels_first' or 'channels_last') and modes ('tf' and 'torch').

### Error Location:
1. The bug likely arises from the condition where `mode` is not 'tf' or 'torch' because the function does not handle this case appropriately.
2. Error handling for different data formats ('channels_first' or 'channels_last') also seems to be a potential issue.

### Bug Explanation:
The bug occurs when the mode is neither 'tf' nor 'torch'. In such cases, the function does not appropriately preprocess the input array based on the data format provided. This can lead to incorrect preprocessing steps or errors when working with different data formats.

### Strategy for Fixing Bug:
1. Modify the function to handle the case when the mode is not 'tf' or 'torch' and ensure appropriate preprocessing based on the data format.
2. Ensure that the function correctly handles both 'channels_first' and 'channels_last' data formats.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def _preprocess_numpy_input(x, data_format, mode):
    if mode == 'tf':
        x /= 127.5
        x -= 1.
        return x

    if mode == 'torch':
        x /= 255.
        mean = [0.485, 0.456, 0.406]
        std = [0.229, 0.224, 0.225]
    else:
        # Handle the default mode (caffe)
        if data_format == 'channels_first':
            if x.ndim == 3:
                x = x[:, ::-1, ...]
            else:
                x = x[:, :, :, ::-1]
        else:
            x = x[..., ::-1]
        mean = [103.939, 116.779, 123.68]
        std = None

    if data_format == 'channels_first':
        x -= mean
        if std is not None:
            x /= std
    else:
        x -= mean
        if std is not None:
            x /= std
    return x
```

By updating the function to handle the default case, fixing the color channel rearrangements based on the data format, and ensuring correct mean subtraction and scaling, the corrected version should pass the failing test.
