### Analysis:
The `_preprocess_numpy_input` function in the `imagenet_utils.py` file is responsible for preprocessing input images based on the specified data format and mode. The function contains conditional statements to handle different modes such as 'tf', 'torch', and default cases. There are calculations and transformations applied to the input array based on the specified mode and data format.

### Identified issues:
1. The function does not properly handle the 'torch' mode as it is missing the normalization step after scaling the pixels between 0 and 1.
2. There is inconsistency in the indexing and operations when processing the input array based on the 'channels_first' data format.

### Bug Explanation:
The bug arises when the function is used with the 'torch' mode. In this case, the function correctly scales the pixels between 0 and 1 but fails to normalize each channel with respect to the ImageNet dataset. This leads to incorrect preprocessing of the input array when the 'torch' mode is selected.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that after scaling the pixels between 0 and 1 in the 'torch' mode, we also normalize each channel with respect to the ImageNet dataset. Additionally, we need to address the inconsistency in indexing and operations when dealing with the 'channels_first' data format to align with the expected behavior.

### Corrected Function:
Here is the corrected version of the `_preprocess_numpy_input` function:

```python
def _preprocess_numpy_input(x, data_format, mode):
    if mode == 'tf':
        x /= 127.5
        x -= 1.
        return x

    if mode == 'torch':
        x /= 255.
        mean = [0.485, 0.456, 0.406]
        std = [0.229, 0.224, 0.225]
        
        x[..., 0] -= mean[0]
        x[..., 1] -= mean[1]
        x[..., 2] -= mean[2]
        
        if std is not None:
            x[..., 0] /= std[0]
            x[..., 1] /= std[1]
            x[..., 2] /= std[2]
            
        return x

    if data_format == 'channels_first':
        if x.ndim == 3:
            x[:, 0, :, :] -= mean[0]
            x[:, 1, :, :] -= mean[1]
            x[:, 2, :, :] -= mean[2]
            if std is not None:
                x[:, 0, :, :] /= std[0]
                x[:, 1, :, :] /= std[1]
                x[:, 2, :, :] /= std[2]
        else:
            x[:, :, 0, :] -= mean[0]
            x[:, :, 1, :] -= mean[1]
            x[:, :, 2, :] -= mean[2]
            if std is not None:
                x[:, :, 0, :] /= std[0]
                x[:, :, 1, :] /= std[1]
                x[:, :, 2, :] /= std[2]
    else:
        # 'RGB'->'BGR' conversion
        x = x[..., ::-1]
        mean = [103.939, 116.779, 123.68]
        std = None
        
        x[..., 0] -= mean[0]
        x[..., 1] -= mean[1]
        x[..., 2] -= mean[2]
        
        if std is not None:
            x[..., 0] /= std[0]
            x[..., 1] /= std[1]
            x[..., 2] /= std[2]
            
    return x
```

By making the above corrections, the function should now properly preprocess input image arrays with the 'torch' mode and handle the 'channels_first' data format consistently.
