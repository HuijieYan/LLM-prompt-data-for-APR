### Analysis:
The buggy function `_preprocess_numpy_input` is responsible for preprocessing a numpy array of image data based on the specified mode and data format. The function contains conditional statements based on the mode specified ('tf', 'torch', or others) to apply different preprocessing steps. In the 'tf' mode, the function scales the input between -1 and 1, while in the 'torch' mode, it scales the input between 0 and 1 and then normalizes each channel based on the ImageNet dataset. For other modes, it converts the RGB input to BGR and applies mean subtraction based on the data format.

### Potential Error Locations:
1. Incorrect handling of channel order and mean pixel subtraction based on the 'channels_first' or 'channels_last' format.
2. The mean values and standard deviations are not calculated correctly for each mode.

### Bug Explanation:
The bug occurs due to incorrect handling of mean pixel subtraction and standard deviation normalization based on the data format ('channels_first' or 'channels_last'). This leads to inaccurate preprocessing of the input array, causing the failing test cases.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Ensure the correct calculation of mean values and standard deviations for different modes.
2. Correctly handle the channel order and mean pixel subtraction based on the specified data format.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def _preprocess_numpy_input(x, data_format, mode):
    if mode == 'tf':
        x /= 127.5
        x -= 1.
        return x

    if mode == 'torch':
        x /= 255.
        mean = [0.485, 0.456, 0.406]
        std = [0.229, 0.224, 0.225]
    else:
        if data_format == 'channels_first':
            # 'RGB'->'BGR'
            if x.ndim == 3:
                x = x[:, ::-1, ...]
            else:
                x = x[:, :, ::-1, ...]
        else:
            # 'RGB'->'BGR'
            x = x[..., ::-1]
        mean = [103.939, 116.779, 123.68]
        std = None

    # Zero-center by mean pixel
    if data_format == 'channels_first':
        x[0, :, :] -= mean[0]
        x[1, :, :] -= mean[1]
        x[2, :, :] -= mean[2]
        if std is not None:
            x[0, :, :] /= std[0]
            x[1, :, :] /= std[1]
            x[2, :, :] /= std[2]
    else:
        x[..., 0] -= mean[0]
        x[..., 1] -= mean[1]
        x[..., 2] -= mean[2]
        if std is not None:
            x[..., 0] /= std[0]
            x[..., 1] /= std[1]
            x[..., 2] /= std[2]

    return x
```

By correcting the mean pixel subtraction and standard deviation normalization based on the data format, as well as the channel order handling, the corrected version of the function should pass the failing test cases.
