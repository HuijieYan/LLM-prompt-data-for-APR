### Bug Analysis:
The error message `Cannot cast ufunc 'subtract' output from dtype('float64') to dtype('int32') with casting rule 'same_kind'` indicates that there is an issue with attempting to subtract a float value from an integer array.

In the buggy function `_preprocess_numpy_input`, the problem arises when trying to subtract the mean values (which are float) from the input array `x` (which is integer) under certain conditions.

### Bug Location:
The bug is located in the section where the mean values are subtracted from the input array `x`, especially when the input array is of integer type.

### Bug Cause:
The bug occurs because the input array `x` is sometimes of integer type (`int32` in this case), and when trying to subtract float values from an integer array, NumPy raises a type conversion error.

### Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the input array `x` is always in float format before performing any operations that involve floating-point calculations.

### Corrected Version:
```python
import numpy as np

def _preprocess_numpy_input(x, data_format, mode):
    if mode == 'tf':
        x = x.astype('float32')  # Convert x to float32 to avoid integer subtraction
        x /= 127.5
        x -= 1.
        return x

    if mode == 'torch':
        x = x.astype('float32')  # Convert x to float32 to avoid integer subtraction
        x /= 255.
        mean = [0.485, 0.456, 0.406]
        std = [0.229, 0.224, 0.225]
    else:
        if data_format == 'channels_first':
            if x.ndim == 3:
                x = x[::-1, ...]
            else:
                x = x[:, ::-1, ...]
        else:
            x = x[..., ::-1]
        mean = [103.939, 116.779, 123.68]
        std = None

    if x.dtype != 'float32':
        x = x.astype('float32')  # Ensure x is float32 before performing operations
        
    # Rest of the function remains the same
    
    return x
```

By ensuring that the input array `x` is always converted to `float32` before any floating-point operations, the bug causing the type conversion error should be fixed.
