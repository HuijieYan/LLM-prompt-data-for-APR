### Bug Explanation
The error message `numpy.core._exceptions.UFuncTypeError: Cannot cast ufunc 'subtract' output from dtype('float64') to dtype('int32') with casting rule 'same_kind'` occurs when trying to subtract `float64` values from `int32` values. In one branch of the function, specifically when the `mode` is not `'tf'` or `'torch'`, the `mean` values are defined with decimal points, making them `float`. However, the input array `x` is of type `int32`, causing the subtraction operation to result in `float64` dtype values, leading to the mentioned error.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To address this issue, we need to ensure that the `x` array is also converted to `float` values before performing arithmetic operations involving `mean`. By converting `x` to float type, we can avoid the casting error that occurs when subtracting `float64` from `int32`.

### Corrected Function
```python
def _preprocess_numpy_input(x, data_format, mode):
    """Preprocesses a Numpy array encoding a batch of images.

    # Arguments
        x: Input array, 3D or 4D.
        data_format: Data format of the image array.
        mode: One of "caffe", "tf" or "torch".
            - caffe: will convert the images from RGB to BGR,
                then will zero-center each color channel with
                respect to the ImageNet dataset,
                without scaling.
            - tf: will scale pixels between -1 and 1,
                sample-wise.
            - torch: will scale pixels between 0 and 1 and then
                will normalize each channel with respect to the
                ImageNet dataset.

After implementing this correction, the function should now correctly preprocess the input array without causing the casting error mentioned in the failing test.
