### Bug Analysis:
The bug occurs because when the input `x` is of type `int32`, the calculations involved in the function operations lead to a conflict between data types. The function assumes that `x` will always be of type `float`, which causes issues when performing arithmetic operations with `int32` arrays.

### Bug location:
The bug is located in the calculation part where the function attempts to subtract the mean value from the input array `x`, which is of type `int32`.

### Bug Explanation:
In the failing test, when `xint` is passed as input to the `preprocess_input` function, `xint` is an array of the type `int32`. When processing `xint` in the `_preprocess_numpy_input` function, the arithmetic operations like subtraction (`x[..., 0] -= mean[0]`) conflict due to the mix of `int32` and `float64` operations, leading to the error:
```
numpy.core._exceptions.UFuncTypeError: Cannot cast ufunc 'subtract' output from dtype('float64') to dtype('int32') with casting rule 'same_kind'
```

### Fix Strategy:
To resolve this bug, we need to ensure that the input `x` is always converted to a float array before performing any arithmetic operations. This can be achieved by explicitly converting `x` to a floating-point array at the beginning of the function to avoid type conflicts during calculations.

### Corrected Function:

```python
def _preprocess_numpy_input(x, data_format, mode):
    if isinstance(x, np.ndarray) and x.dtype == np.dtype('int32'):
        x = x.astype('float32')  # Convert input to float array if it's of type int32

    if mode == 'tf':
        x /= 127.5
        x -= 1.
        return x

    if mode == 'torch':
        x /= 255.
        mean = [0.485, 0.456, 0.406]
        std = [0.229, 0.224, 0.225]
    else:
        if data_format == 'channels_first':
            if x.ndim == 3:
                x = x[::-1, ...]
            else:
                x = x[:, ::-1, ...]
        else:
            x = x[..., ::-1]
        mean = [103.939, 116.779, 123.68]
        std = None

    if data_format == 'channels_first':
        if x.ndim == 3:
            x[0, :, :] -= mean[0]
            x[1, :, :] -= mean[1]
            x[2, :, :] -= mean[2]
            if std is not None:
                x[0, :, :] /= std[0]
                x[1, :, :] /= std[1]
                x[2, :, :] /= std[2]
        else:
            x[:, 0, :, :] -= mean[0]
            x[:, 1, :, :] -= mean[1]
            x[:, 2, :, :] -= mean[2]
            if std is not None:
                x[:, 0, :, :] /= std[0]
                x[:, 1, :, :] /= std[1]
                x[:, 2, :, :] /= std[2]
    else:
        x[..., 0] -= mean[0]
        x[..., 1] -= mean[1]
        x[..., 2] -= mean[2]
        if std is not None:
            x[..., 0] /= std[0]
            x[..., 1] /= std[1]
            x[..., 2] /= std[2]
            
    return x
```

By explicitly converting `x` to a float array if it's of type `int32` at the beginning of the function, the corrected version should resolve the type conflict issue and pass the failing test.
