### Bug Analysis:
The error message indicates a `UFuncTypeError` related to casting from `float64` to `int32` in the line where subtraction operation is applied to the input array `x`. This error suggests that the input array `x` contains float values that need to be properly casted to ensure consistent data types throughout the computation.

In the provided buggy function `_preprocess_numpy_input`, the issue is that the input array `x` is not consistently handled based on the `mode` and `data_format`. When the `mode` is `'torch'`, the function divides `x` by 255.0, resulting in float values. However, when the `data_format` is not 'channels_first', it then tries to subtract mean values, which are in float format, causing the UFuncTypeError. 

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the input array `x` is properly casted to the correct data type when necessary and handle in a consistent manner based on the `mode` and `data_format`.

### Updated Corrected Function:
```python
def _preprocess_numpy_input(x, data_format, mode):
    """Preprocesses a Numpy array encoding a batch of images.

    # Arguments
        x: Input array, 3D or 4D.
        data_format: Data format of the image array.
        mode: One of "caffe", "tf" or "torch".
            - caffe: will convert the images from RGB to BGR,
                then will zero-center each color channel with
                respect to the ImageNet dataset,
                without scaling.
            - tf: will scale pixels between -1 and 1,
                sample-wise.
            - torch: will scale pixels between 0 and 1 and then
                will normalize each channel with respect to the
                ImageNet dataset.

By re-casting the input array to `float32` at the beginning of the function and ensuring consistency in handling data types throughout the computation, this corrected version should now properly preprocess the input array without causing the UFuncTypeError.
