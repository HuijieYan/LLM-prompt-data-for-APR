### Bug Analysis:
The bug occurs when the function tries to subtract the mean values from the input array `x` while the input array contains integer values. This leads to a type mismatch error as the mean values are floats and cannot be subtracted from integers without casting issues.

### Bug Fix:
To resolve this bug, we need to ensure that the input array `x` is converted to floating-point values before any arithmetic operations are performed on it. This can be achieved by adding a type conversion step at the beginning of the function to convert `x` to float values.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def _preprocess_numpy_input(x, data_format, mode):
    """Preprocesses a Numpy array encoding a batch of images.

    # Arguments
        x: Input array, 3D or 4D.
        data_format: Data format of the image array.
        mode: One of "caffe", "tf" or "torch".
            - caffe: will convert the images from RGB to BGR,
                then will zero-center each color channel with
                respect to the ImageNet dataset,
                without scaling.
            - tf: will scale pixels between -1 and 1,
                sample-wise.
            - torch: will scale pixels between 0 and 1 and then
                will normalize each channel with respect to the
                ImageNet dataset.

    # Returns
        Preprocessed Numpy array.

After applying this fix, the function should now correctly handle integer input arrays and perform the necessary operations without encountering type mismatch errors.
