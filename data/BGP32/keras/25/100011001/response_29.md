### Bug Analysis:
The bug occurs due to the data type mismatch when performing subtraction operations on the input array `x` with mean values in the `torch` mode. The operation tries to subtract `mean` from `x`, which is of type int32, causing a `UFuncTypeError` since the subtraction operation expects float inputs.

### Bug Fix:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the input `x` is converted to a float type before performing the subtraction operation.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def _preprocess_numpy_input(x, data_format, mode):
    """Preprocesses a Numpy array encoding a batch of images.

    # Arguments
        x: Input array, 3D or 4D.
        data_format: Data format of the image array.
        mode: One of "caffe", "tf" or "torch".
            - caffe: will convert the images from RGB to BGR,
                then will zero-center each color channel with
                respect to the ImageNet dataset,
                without scaling.
            - tf: will scale pixels between -1 and 1,
                sample-wise.
            - torch: will scale pixels between 0 and 1 and then
                will normalize each channel with respect to the
                ImageNet dataset.

    # Returns
        Preprocessed Numpy array.

By converting `x` to float type at the beginning of the function, we prevent the `UFuncTypeError` from occurring during subtraction operations. This corrected version should pass the failing test case provided.
