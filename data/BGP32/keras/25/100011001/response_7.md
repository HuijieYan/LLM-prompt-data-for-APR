### Bug Analysis:
The bug occurs when the `mode` is set to `'caffe'`, which should result in the image data being converted from RGB to BGR and then zero-centered with respect to the ImageNet dataset without scaling. However, the bug is in the section where the mean pixel values are subtracted from the input array `x`. The mean pixel values are set to `[103.939, 116.779, 123.68]`, which are floating-point values, causing a mismatch when trying to subtract them from the integer input array `x`.

### Bug Fix:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the mean pixel values are appropriately cast to the same data type as the input array `x`. We can achieve this by converting the mean pixel values to integers before performing the subtraction operation.

### Corrected Function:
```python
def _preprocess_numpy_input(x, data_format, mode):
    if mode == 'tf':
        x /= 127.5
        x -= 1.
        return x

    if mode == 'torch':
        x /= 255.
        mean = [0.485, 0.456, 0.406]
        std = [0.229, 0.224, 0.225]
    elif mode == 'caffe':
        mean = [103.939, 116.779, 123.68]
        mean = [int(m) for m in mean]  # Convert mean values to integers
        std = None
    else:
        if data_format == 'channels_first':
            # 'RGB'->'BGR'
            if x.ndim == 3:
                x = x[::-1, ...]
            else:
                x = x[:, ::-1, ...]
        else:
            # 'RGB'->'BGR'
            x = x[..., ::-1]
        mean = [103.939, 116.779, 123.68]
        std = None

    # Zero-center by mean pixel
    if data_format == 'channels_first':
        if x.ndim == 3:
            x[0, :, :] -= mean[0]
            x[1, :, :] -= mean[1]
            x[2, :, :] -= mean[2]
            if std is not None:
                x[0, :, :] /= std[0]
                x[1, :, :] /= std[1]
                x[2, :, :] /= std[2]
        else:
            x[:, 0, :, :] -= mean[0]
            x[:, 1, :, :] -= mean[1]
            x[:, 2, :, :] -= mean[2]
            if std is not None:
                x[:, 0, :, :] /= std[0]
                x[:, 1, :, :] /= std[1]
                x[:, 2, :, :] /= std[2]
    else:
        x[..., 0] -= mean[0]
        x[..., 1] -= mean[1]
        x[..., 2] -= mean[2]
        if std is not None:
            x[..., 0] /= std[0]
            x[..., 1] /= std[1]
            x[..., 2] /= std[2]
    return x
``` 

After applying this correction, the function should now handle the `'caffe'` mode correctly, allowing the processing to proceed without errors for integer input arrays.
