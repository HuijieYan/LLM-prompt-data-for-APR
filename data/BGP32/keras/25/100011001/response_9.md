### Bug Analysis
The bug is related to incorrect type casting when subtracting the mean values from the input array `x` in the `_preprocess_numpy_input` function. The error message `UFuncTypeError: Cannot cast ufunc 'subtract' output from dtype('float64') to dtype('int32') with casting rule 'same_kind'` indicates that there is an issue with the data types of the arrays involved in the subtraction operation.

The runtime values show that the input array `x` is of type `float64`, which is the default type for numeric arrays in NumPy. The mean values are provided as a list of floats. During the subtraction operation, the mean values need to be subtracted from the input array `x`, leading to a type mismatch because the mean values are of type float and the input array `x` is of type `float64`.

### Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the mean values are broadcasted correctly to match the shape and data type of the input array `x`. This can be achieved by converting the mean values to a NumPy array of the same type and shape as `x` before performing the subtraction operation.

### Corrected Function
```python
import numpy as np

def _preprocess_numpy_input(x, data_format, mode):
    """Preprocesses a Numpy array encoding a batch of images.

    # Arguments
        x: Input array, 3D or 4D.
        data_format: Data format of the image array.
        mode: One of "caffe", "tf" or "torch".
            - caffe: will convert the images from RGB to BGR,
                then will zero-center each color channel with
                respect to the ImageNet dataset,
                without scaling.
            - tf: will scale pixels between -1 and 1,
                sample-wise.
            - torch: will scale pixels between 0 and 1 and then
                will normalize each channel with respect to the
                ImageNet dataset.

    # Returns
        Preprocessed Numpy array.
    """
    if mode == 'tf':
        x /= 127.5
        x -= 1.
        return x

    if mode == 'torch':
        x /= 255.
        mean = np.array([0.485, 0.456, 0.406], dtype=x.dtype)  # Convert mean to the same type as x
        std = np.array([0.229, 0.224, 0.225], dtype=x.dtype)  # Convert std to the same type as x
    else:
        if data_format == 'channels_first':
            # 'RGB'->'BGR'
            if x.ndim == 3:
                x = x[::-1, ...]
            else:
                x = x[:, ::-1, ...]
        else:
            # 'RGB'->'BGR'
            x = x[..., ::-1]
        mean = np.array([103.939, 116.779, 123.68], dtype=x.dtype)  # Convert mean to the same type as x
        std = None

    # Zero-center by mean pixel
    x -= mean[..., None, None]  # Broadcast mean to match the shape of x
    if std is not None:
        x /= std[..., None, None]  # Broadcast std to match the shape of x

    return x
```

By converting the mean and std values to NumPy arrays of the same type as the input array `x` and properly broadcasting them, we ensure that the subtraction and division operations are performed correctly without type mismatches. This corrected version of the function should pass the failing test.
