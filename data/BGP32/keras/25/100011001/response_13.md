### Bug Analysis:
The error message indicates that there is an issue with casting the output of the subtraction operation from dtype('float64') to dtype('int32'). This error occurs at the line `x[..., 0] -= mean[0]`.

Looking at the code, the bug is caused by trying to subtract a float value from an integer array (`x`). This can happen when `mode` is not 'tf' or 'torch' and `data_format` is not 'channels_first'. In this scenario, the mean values are floats (like 103.939) while `x` is expected to be an integer array.

### Bug Fix:
To fix this bug, we need to ensure that both `x` and the mean values are of the same type before performing the subtraction operation. We can achieve this by converting `x` to a float array before the subtraction.

### Corrected Version of the Function:

```python
def _preprocess_numpy_input(x, data_format, mode):
    if mode == 'tf':
        x /= 127.5
        x -= 1.
        return x

    if mode == 'torch':
        x /= 255.
        mean = [0.485, 0.456, 0.406]
        std = [0.229, 0.224, 0.225]
    else:
        x = x.astype('float32')  # Convert x to float array
        if data_format == 'channels_first':
            if x.ndim == 3:
                x = x[::-1, ...]
            else:
                x = x[:, ::-1, ...]
        else:
            x = x[..., ::-1]
        mean = [103.939, 116.779, 123.68]
        std = None

    if data_format == 'channels_first':
        if x.ndim == 3:
            x[0, :, :] -= mean[0]
            x[1, :, :] -= mean[1]
            x[2, :, :] -= mean[2]
            if std is not None:
                x[0, :, :] /= std[0]
                x[1, :, :] /= std[1]
                x[2, :, :] /= std[2]
        else:
            x[:, 0, :, :] -= mean[0]
            x[:, 1, :, :] -= mean[1]
            x[:, 2, :, :] -= mean[2]
            if std is not None:
                x[:, 0, :, :] /= std[0]
                x[:, 1, :, :] /= std[1]
                x[:, 2, :, :] /= std[2]
    else:
        x[..., 0] -= mean[0]
        x[..., 1] -= mean[1]
        x[..., 2] -= mean[2]
        if std is not None:
            x[..., 0] /= std[0]
            x[..., 1] /= std[1]
            x[..., 2] /= std[2]
    return x
```
