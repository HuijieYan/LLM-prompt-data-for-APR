### Bug in the Buggy Function
The bug in the `_preprocess_numpy_input` function arises from the calculation and manipulation of numpy arrays without considering their data types adequately. The error message indicates that there is an issue with attempting to subtract a float value from an array of type `int32`. This mismatch in data types causes a `UFuncTypeError`.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, ensure that all calculations involving numpy arrays in the function are performed with compatible data types to avoid such errors.

### Corrected Version of the Function
```python
import numpy as np

def _preprocess_numpy_input(x, data_format, mode):
    if mode == 'tf':
        x = x.astype('float32') / 127.5 - 1.
        return x

    if mode == 'torch':
        x = x.astype('float32') / 255.
        mean = np.array([0.485, 0.456, 0.406], dtype='float32')
        std = np.array([0.229, 0.224, 0.225], dtype='float32')
    else:
        if data_format == 'channels_first':
            if x.ndim == 3:
                x = x[:, ::-1, ...]
            else:
                x = x[:, :, ::-1, ...]
        else:
            x = x[..., ::-1]  # 'RGB'->'BGR'
        mean = np.array([103.939, 116.779, 123.68], dtype='float32')
        std = None

    # Zero-center by mean pixel
    x = x.astype('float32')
    if data_format == 'channels_first':
        x -= mean.reshape(1, 3, 1, 1)
        if std is not None:
            x /= std.reshape(1, 3, 1, 1)
    else:
        x -= mean
        if std is not None:
            x /= std

    return x
```

In this corrected version:
- The input array `x` is explicitly cast to `float32` before performing arithmetic operations.
- The mean and standard deviation values are initialized as numpy arrays with type `float32`.
- Broadcasting is used to apply mean and standard deviation adjustments based on the data format.

This corrected version should now handle the input types appropriately and avoid the previous type conversion error.
