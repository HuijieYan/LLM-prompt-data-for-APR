### Bug Analysis
The bug occurs when `mode` is not 'tf' or 'torch' and the `data_format` is 'channels_last'. In this case, the function tries to subtract `mean[0]` (which is a float) from `x[..., 0]` (which is an array of floats representing the color channels), resulting in a UFuncTypeError due to trying to subtract a float from an integer (int32) array element.

### Bug Fix
To fix this bug, we need to ensure that when `data_format` is 'channels_last', the mean subtraction is done properly for all color channels by iterating over all channel indices.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _preprocess_numpy_input(x, data_format, mode):
    if mode == 'tf':
        x /= 127.5
        x -= 1.
        return x

    if mode == 'torch':
        x /= 255.
        mean = [0.485, 0.456, 0.406]
        std = [0.229, 0.224, 0.225]
    else:
        if data_format == 'channels_first':
            if x.ndim == 3:
                x = x[::-1, ...]
            else:
                x = x[:, ::-1, ...]
        else:
            x = x[..., ::-1]
            mean = [103.939, 116.779, 123.68]
            std = None

    if mean is not None:
        for i in range(3):
            x[..., i] -= mean[i]
            if std is not None:
                x[..., i] /= std[i]

    return x
```

This fix ensures that when `data_format` is 'channels_last', all color channels are processed correctly for mean subtraction and normalization.
