### Bug Explanation
The error message `numpy.core._exceptions.UFuncTypeError: Cannot cast ufunc 'subtract' output from dtype('float64') to dtype('int32') with casting rule 'same_kind'` is pointing to a type casting issue. The bug occurs when trying to subtract floating-point numbers from integers in the array `x`.

In the provided function `_preprocess_numpy_input`, the preprocessing steps are not handling the input data type properly. When `mode != 'tf'` and `mode != 'torch'`, the function applies subtraction operations with floating-point numbers (elements of the `mean` array) on an integer numpy array `x`, resulting in the type casting error.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the input numpy array `x` remains consistent in terms of data types across all arithmetic operations. We can achieve this by converting `x` to a floating-point data type at the beginning of the preprocessing function.

### Corrected Version
```python
import numpy as np

def _preprocess_numpy_input(x, data_format, mode):
    x = x.astype(np.float32)  # Ensure x is of floating-point type
    """Preprocesses a Numpy array encoding a batch of images.

    # Arguments
    x: Input array, 3D or 4D.
    data_format: Data format of the image array.
    mode: One of "caffe", "tf" or "torch".
        - caffe: will convert the images from RGB to BGR,
            then will zero-center each color channel with
            respect to the ImageNet dataset,
            without scaling.
        - tf: will scale pixels between -1 and 1,
            sample-wise.
        - torch: will scale pixels between 0 and 1 and then
           will normalize each channel with respect to the
            ImageNet dataset.

    # Returns
    Preprocessed Numpy array.

By explicitly converting `x` to a floating-point data type at the beginning of the function, we ensure consistent data types throughout the preprocessing steps, fixing the type casting issue and enabling the function to handle various modes correctly.
