### Bug Explanation
The bug occurs when the `mode` is not `'tf'` or `'torch'` because the code does not properly handle converting the images from RGB to BGR and adjusting the pixel values according to the ImageNet dataset. In this case, for mode `'caffe'` and data_format `'channels_last'`, the function attempts to subtract the mean values (which are floats) from the pixel values (which are integers), leading to a type conversion issue.

### Bug Fix
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the pixel values in the input array `x` are handled properly based on the `mode` and `data_format` provided. Specifically, when using the `'caffe'` mode, we need to convert the pixel values to floats before subtracting the mean values.

Here is the corrected version of the `_preprocess_numpy_input` function:

```python
def _preprocess_numpy_input(x, data_format, mode):
    if mode == 'tf':
        x /= 127.5
        x -= 1.
        return x

    if mode == 'torch':
        x = x.astype('float32') / 255.
        mean = [0.485, 0.456, 0.406]
        std = [0.229, 0.224, 0.225]
    else:
        x = x.astype('float32')  # Convert pixel values to float
        if data_format == 'channels_first':
            # 'RGB'->'BGR'
            if x.ndim == 3:
                x = x[:, ::-1, ...]
            else:
                x = x[:, :, ::-1, ...]
        else:
            # 'RGB'->'BGR'
            x = x[..., ::-1]
        mean = [103.939, 116.779, 123.68]
        std = None

    # Zero-center by mean pixel
    if data_format == 'channels_first':
        x[:, 0, :, :] -= mean[0]
        x[:, 1, :, :] -= mean[1]
        x[:, 2, :, :] -= mean[2]
        if std is not None:
            x[:, 0, :, :] /= std[0]
            x[:, 1, :, :] /= std[1]
            x[:, 2, :, :] /= std[2]
    else:
        x[..., 0] -= mean[0]
        x[..., 1] -= mean[1]
        x[..., 2] -= mean[2]
        if std is not None:
            x[..., 0] /= std[0]
            x[..., 1] /= std[1]
            x[..., 2] /= std[2]

    return x
```

With this corrected version, the function will handle the conversion of pixel values to floats before performing operations such as subtraction, preventing type conversion issues.
