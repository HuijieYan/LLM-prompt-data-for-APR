### Bug Explanation:
The bug occurs when the input `x` is of type `int32` and the `mode` is different from 'tf' and 'torch'. The problem arises when trying to subtract the `mean` values, which are floats, from the `x` array elements, which are integers. This causes a numpy error because numpy cannot cast the output of the subtraction operation to `int32` when it is a float.

### Bug Fix:
To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the input array `x` is converted to a float type before performing any arithmetic operations. 

### Corrected Version:
```python
def _preprocess_numpy_input(x, data_format, mode):
    """Preprocesses a Numpy array encoding a batch of images.

    # Arguments
        x: Input array, 3D or 4D.
        data_format: Data format of the image array.
        mode: One of "caffe", "tf" or "torch".
            - caffe: will convert the images from RGB to BGR,
                then will zero-center each color channel with
                respect to the ImageNet dataset,
                without scaling.
            - tf: will scale pixels between -1 and 1,
                sample-wise.
            - torch: will scale pixels between 0 and 1 and then
                will normalize each channel with respect to the
                ImageNet dataset.

        Preprocessed Numpy array.

By converting `x` to float32 at the beginning of the function, we ensure that any subsequent operations involving floating-point values will be compatible. This corrected version of the function should now handle input arrays of type int32 correctly, fixing the bug and allowing the failing test to pass.
