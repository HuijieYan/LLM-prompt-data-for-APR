### Bug Explanation
The bug occurs because when the `mode` is not 'tf' or 'torch', the function encounters an issue with the variable `mean`. The variable `mean` is assigned the value `[103.939, 116.779, 123.68]` when `mode` is not 'tf' or 'torch', which is intended for the 'tf' mode. As a result, when trying to subtract `mean` from the input `x` which has integer values, it leads to a type mismatch error.

### Bug Fix
To fix this bug, we need to handle the calculation of mean values based on the `mode` properly. When `mode` is not 'tf' or 'torch', we should use the appropriate mean values for the 'caffe' mode. Additionally, to avoid type mismatch errors, we need to ensure that the input `x` and computed values are of the same data type.

### Corrected Version
```python
def _preprocess_numpy_input(x, data_format, mode):
    """Preprocesses a Numpy array encoding a batch of images.

    # Arguments
        x: Input array, 3D or 4D.
        data_format: Data format of the image array.
        mode: One of "caffe", "tf" or "torch".
            - caffe: will convert the images from RGB to BGR,
                then will zero-center each color channel with
                respect to the ImageNet dataset,
                without scaling.
            - tf: will scale pixels between -1 and 1,
                sample-wise.
            - torch: will scale pixels between 0 and 1 and then
                will normalize each channel with respect to the
                ImageNet dataset.

    # Returns
        Preprocessed Numpy array.
    """
    if mode == 'tf':
        x = x.astype('float32')
        x /= 127.5
        x -= 1.
        return x

    if mode == 'torch':
        x = x.astype('float32')
        x /= 255.
        mean = [0.485, 0.456, 0.406]
        std = [0.229, 0.224, 0.225]
    else:
        x = x.astype('float32')
        if data_format == 'channels_first':
            # 'RGB'->'BGR'
            if x.ndim == 3:
                x = x[:, ::-1, ...]
            else:
                x = x[:, :, ::-1, ...]
            mean = [103.939, 116.779, 123.68]
            std = None
        else:
            # 'RGB'->'BGR'
            x = x[..., ::-1]
            mean = [103.939, 116.779, 123.68]
            std = None

    # Zero-center by mean pixel
    if std is not None:
        x -= mean
        x /= std
    else:
        x -= mean

    return x
``` 

This corrected version makes sure to handle the calculation of mean values based on the `mode`, properly converts the input `x` to float32 before any calculations, and ensures that the input `x` and computed values are of the same data type to prevent type mismatch errors.
