### Bug Explanation
The error message indicates a `UFuncTypeError` stating that it cannot cast the output of the subtraction operation from type 'float64' to 'int32'. This error occurs because at certain branches of the code, when subtracting the mean values from the input array, the type of the input array changes based on input types.

### Bug Location
The bug occurs when subtracting the mean values from the input array before normalizing. Specifically, when updating the color channels based on the mean values, the data type of the array changes unintentionally which leads to the error.

### Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, ensure that the input array `x` remains consistent in type throughout the operations. This can be achieved by casting the mean values to the same type as the input array before performing the subtraction operation.

### Corrected Version
```python
def _preprocess_numpy_input(x, data_format, mode):
    """Preprocesses a Numpy array encoding a batch of images.

    # Arguments
        x: Input array, 3D or 4D.
        data_format: Data format of the image array.
        mode: One of "caffe", "tf" or "torch".
            - caffe: will convert the images from RGB to BGR,
                then will zero-center each color channel with
                respect to the ImageNet dataset,
                without scaling.
            - tf: will scale pixels between -1 and 1,
                sample-wise.
            - torch: will scale pixels between 0 and 1 and then
                will normalize each channel with respect to the
                ImageNet dataset.

    # Returns
        Preprocessed Numpy array.
    """
    x = x.astype('float32')  # Cast input array to float32

    if mode == 'tf':
        x /= 127.5
        x -= 1.
        return x

    if mode == 'torch':
        x /= 255.
        mean = np.array([0.485, 0.456, 0.406], dtype=x.dtype)  # Cast mean to the same type as x
        std = np.array([0.229, 0.224, 0.225], dtype=x.dtype)  # Cast std to the same type as x
    else:
        if data_format == 'channels_first':
            # 'RGB'->'BGR'
            if x.ndim == 3:
                x = x[::-1, ...]
            else:
                x = x[:, ::-1, ...]
        else:
            # 'RGB'->'BGR'
            x = x[..., ::-1]
        mean = np.array([103.939, 116.779, 123.68], dtype=x.dtype)  # Cast mean to the same type as x
        std = None

    # Zero-center by mean pixel
    x -= mean.reshape((1, 1, 1, 3))  # Broadcasting the mean to subtract from x
    
    if std is not None:
        x /= std.reshape((1, 1, 1, 3))  # Broadcasting the std to divide x

    return x
```

By making these modifications and ensuring consistency in data types, the bug causing the `UFuncTypeError` should be resolved.
