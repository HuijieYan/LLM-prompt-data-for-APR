### Bug Analysis:
The error message indicates a `UFuncTypeError` when trying to subtract `mean[0]` from `x[..., 0]`. The error occurs because `mean[0]` is a floating-point value while `x[..., 0]` is of type `int32`, resulting in an incompatible operation.

### Bug Fix:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the data types of the elements in `x` and `mean` are compatible for subtraction operations. We can cast `mean` values to `float` before performing the subtraction to match the data type of `x`.

### Corrected Function:
```python
def _preprocess_numpy_input(x, data_format, mode):
    """Preprocesses a Numpy array encoding a batch of images.

    # Arguments
        x: Input array, 3D or 4D.
        data_format: Data format of the image array.
        mode: One of "caffe", "tf" or "torch".
            - caffe: will convert the images from RGB to BGR,
                then will zero-center each color channel with
                respect to the ImageNet dataset,
                without scaling.
            - tf: will scale pixels between -1 and 1,
                sample-wise.
            - torch: will scale pixels between 0 and 1 and then
                will normalize each channel with respect to the
                ImageNet dataset.

    # Returns
        Preprocessed Numpy array.

By casting `x` to float in the `mode == 'torch'` branch, the corrected function ensures compatibility between the data types for subtraction operations, resolving the `UFuncTypeError`.
