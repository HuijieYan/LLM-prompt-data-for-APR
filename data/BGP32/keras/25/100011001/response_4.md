### Bug Analysis:
The bug occurs when the `mode` is not `'tf'` or `'torch'`. In this case, the function tries to handle the preprocessing based on the `data_format`, which involves subtracting the `mean` values from the input array `x`. The error arises from the fact that the input array `x` is of type int32, while the `mean` values are floating-point values. 

When attempting to subtract a floating-point value from an int32 array, a type mismatch occurs, leading to the error message: `UFuncTypeError: Cannot cast ufunc 'subtract' output from dtype('float64') to dtype('int32') with casting rule 'same_kind'`.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To address the bug, we need to ensure that all arithmetic operations involving the input array `x` and the `mean` values result in a consistent data type. This can be achieved by converting the input array `x` to floating-point values before applying the mean subtraction.

### Corrected Function:
```python
def _preprocess_numpy_input(x, data_format, mode):
    """Preprocesses a Numpy array encoding a batch of images.

    # Arguments
        x: Input array, 3D or 4D.
        data_format: Data format of the image array.
        mode: One of "caffe", "tf" or "torch".
            - caffe: will convert the images from RGB to BGR,
                then will zero-center each color channel with
                respect to the ImageNet dataset,
                without scaling.
            - tf: will scale pixels between -1 and 1,
                sample-wise.
            - torch: will scale pixels between 0 and 1 and then
                will normalize each channel with respect to the
                ImageNet dataset.

After applying the provided fix, the corrected function should handle the data type conversion correctly, ensuring that the arithmetic operations are performed between compatible data types. This correction should resolve the type mismatch issue and allow the function to process the input arrays without errors.
