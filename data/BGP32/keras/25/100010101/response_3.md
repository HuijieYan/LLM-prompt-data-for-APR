### Analysis:
- The buggy function `_preprocess_numpy_input` aims to preprocess a Numpy array encoding a batch of images based on the provided `data_format` and `mode`.
- The error occurs due to attempting to subtract floating-point values from an array of integers.
- The error message indicates a `UFuncTypeError` when trying to cast the output of the subtraction operation to an integer type.
- The issue arises when attempting to subtract the `mean` values (which are floats) from the input array `x` (which is integer) in some conditions.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure consistency in data types during the calculations. Specifically, we need to make sure that all arithmetic operations are consistent in type across the entire array `x` by enforcing float division and subtraction.

### Correction:
```python
import numpy as np

def _preprocess_numpy_input(x, data_format, mode):
    """Preprocesses a Numpy array encoding a batch of images.

    # Arguments
        x: Input array, 3D or 4D.
        data_format: Data format of the image array.
        mode: One of "caffe", "tf" or "torch".
            - caffe: will convert the images from RGB to BGR,
                then will zero-center each color channel with
                respect to the ImageNet dataset,
                without scaling.
            - tf: will scale pixels between -1 and 1,
                sample-wise.
            - torch: will scale pixels between 0 and 1 and then
                will normalize each channel with respect to the
                ImageNet dataset.

    # Returns
        Preprocessed Numpy array.
    """
    
    x = x.astype('float32')  # Convert input array to float32 type
    
    if mode == 'tf':
        x /= 127.5
        x -= 1.
        return x

    if mode == 'torch':
        x /= 255.
        mean = [0.485, 0.456, 0.406]
        std = [0.229, 0.224, 0.225]
    else:
        if data_format == 'channels_first':
            # 'RGB'->'BGR'
            if x.ndim == 3:
                x = x[:, ::-1, ...]
            else:
                x = x[:, ::-1, :, :]
        else:
            # 'RGB'->'BGR'
            x = x[..., ::-1]
        mean = [103.939, 116.779, 123.68]
        std = None

    # Zero-center by mean pixel
    x -= mean
    if std is not None:
        x /= std

    return x
```

### The corrected function:
- The corrected function includes the conversion of the input array `x` to `float32` type at the beginning of the function.
- Ensures consistent type for all arithmetic operations by performing float division and subtraction operations.
- Adjusts the order of operations to ensure that subtraction and division are performed on float type arrays.
- By applying these changes, the corrected function should handle the provided test cases and avoid the previous error.
