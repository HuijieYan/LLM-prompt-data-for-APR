The bug in the `_preprocess_numpy_input` function arises due to inconsistent handling of data types between the float and int32 arrays. Specifically, for the 'caffe' mode, the function performs subtraction with `mean` which is of float type on an int32 array `x`. This results in a `UFuncTypeError` since the output dtype of the subtraction operation is 'float64' instead of 'int32', which cannot be cast. As a general strategy to fix this issue, we need to ensure that all calculations are done with the same data type to avoid type mismatches.

Here's the corrected version of the `_preprocess_numpy_input` function:

```python
def _preprocess_numpy_input(x, data_format, mode):
    """Preprocesses a Numpy array encoding a batch of images.

    # Arguments
        x: Input array, 3D or 4D.
        data_format: Data format of the image array.
        mode: One of "caffe", "tf" or "torch".
            - caffe: will convert the images from RGB to BGR,
                then will zero-center each color channel with
                respect to the ImageNet dataset,
                without scaling.
            - tf: will scale pixels between -1 and 1,
                sample-wise.
            - torch: will scale pixels between 0 and 1 and then
                will normalize each channel with respect to the
                ImageNet dataset.

    # Returns
        Preprocessed Numpy array.
    """
    x = x.astype('float32')  # Convert all inputs to float32 for consistency

    if mode == 'tf':
        x /= 127.5
        x -= 1.
        return x

    if mode == 'torch':
        x /= 255.
        mean = [0.485, 0.456, 0.406]
        std = [0.229, 0.224, 0.225]
    else:
        if data_format == 'channels_first':
            # 'RGB'->'BGR'
            if x.ndim == 3:
                x = x[:, ::-1, ...]
            else:
                x = x[:, :, ::-1, :]
        else:
            # 'RGB'->'BGR'
            x = x[..., ::-1]
        mean = [103.939, 116.779, 123.68]
        std = None

    # Zero-center by mean pixel
    x -= mean
    if std is not None:
        x /= std

    return x
```

This corrected version converts the input array `x` to float32 at the beginning and then performs all calculations using float32 numbers. This ensures consistency in data types and prevents any casting issues. The function should now be able to handle both float32 and int32 input arrays correctly for the 'caffe' mode.
