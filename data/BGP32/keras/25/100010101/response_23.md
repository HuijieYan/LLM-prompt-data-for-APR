### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_preprocess_numpy_input` is responsible for preprocessing a Numpy array encoding a batch of images based on the provided `data_format` and `mode`.
2. The error message indicates a `UFuncTypeError`, specifically in the line that tries to subtract the mean value.
3. The error is caused by attempting to subtract a float value from an integer value in the input array.
4. To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the input array is converted to a float type before performing arithmetic operations. 

### Solution:
1. Convert the input array `x` to float type at the beginning of the function.
2. Check the data type of the x array and then apply operations accordingly.
3. Make sure that the mean values are also of the same float type for consistency.
4. Update the code to handle the case where the input array may already be float type but ensure the data type consistency for subsequent operations.

### Corrected Code:
```python
def _preprocess_numpy_input(x, data_format, mode):
    """Preprocesses a Numpy array encoding a batch of images.

    # Arguments
        x: Input array, 3D or 4D.
        data_format: Data format of the image array.
        mode: One of "caffe", "tf" or "torch".
            - caffe: will convert the images from RGB to BGR,
                then will zero-center each color channel with
                respect to the ImageNet dataset,
                without scaling.
            - tf: will scale pixels between -1 and 1,
                sample-wise.
            - torch: will scale pixels between 0 and 1 and then
                will normalize each channel with respect to the
                ImageNet dataset.
