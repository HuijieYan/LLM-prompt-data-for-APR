### Analysis:
- The buggy function `_preprocess_numpy_input` has issues with the data conversion and normalization based on the `mode` and `data_format` parameters.
- The error message indicates a type casting error while subtracting the mean values from the input array.
- The function is supposed to apply specific preprocessing steps based on the `mode` and `data_format` provided.

### Bug in the code:
- The bug occurs when subtracting the mean values from the input array `x` with type mismatch, resulting in a type casting error.

### Strategy to fix the bug:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the mean subtraction is performed on the same data type as the input array. This can be achieved by converting the mean values to the same data type as the input array `x` before performing the subtraction.

### Corrected version of the function:

```python
def _preprocess_numpy_input(x, data_format, mode):
    if mode == 'tf':
        x /= 127.5
        x -= 1.
        return x

    if mode == 'torch':
        x /= 255.
        mean = np.array([0.485, 0.456, 0.406], dtype=x.dtype)
        std = np.array([0.229, 0.224, 0.225], dtype=x.dtype)
    else:
        if data_format == 'channels_first':
            # 'RGB'->'BGR'
            if x.ndim == 3:
                x = x[:, ::-1, ...]
            else:
                x = x[:, :, ::-1, ...]
        else:
            # 'RGB'->'BGR'
            x = x[..., ::-1]
        mean = np.array([103.939, 116.779, 123.68], dtype=x.dtype)
        std = None

    # Zero-center by mean pixel
    if data_format == 'channels_first':
        x -= mean[:, None, None]
        if std is not None:
            x /= std[:, None, None]
    else:
        x -= mean
        if std is not None:
            x /= std

    return x
```

This corrected version ensures that the mean values are converted to the same data type as the input array `x` before performing subtraction. This approach resolves the type casting error and ensures proper preprocessing based on the given `mode` and `data_format`.
