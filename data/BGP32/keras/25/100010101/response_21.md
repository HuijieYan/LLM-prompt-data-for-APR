### Bug Analysis:
In the "if mode == 'torch':" block of the `_preprocess_numpy_input` function, the function divides the input `x` array by 255 and then calculates the `mean` and `std` values based on the given constants. Later in the function, it tries to subtract the `mean` values which are floats, from the `x` array which can lead to a data type mismatch error due to the numpy ufunc operation. This is the reason for the `UFuncTypeError` that occurs during the failing test execution.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the dtype of the `mean` and `std` values match the dtype of the `x` array. Since the use of float values is more common in these kind of operations, we will convert the `mean` and `std` values to `float32` dtype to match the dtype of the input array `x`.

### Corrected Version of the Function:

```python
def _preprocess_numpy_input(x, data_format, mode):
    if mode == 'tf':
        x /= 127.5
        x -= 1.
        return x

    if mode == 'torch':
        x = x / 255.0
        mean = np.array([0.485, 0.456, 0.406], dtype=np.float32)
        std = np.array([0.229, 0.224, 0.225], dtype=np.float32)
    else:
        mean = np.array([103.939, 116.779, 123.68], dtype=np.float32)
        std = None

        if data_format == 'channels_first':
            if x.ndim == 3:
                x[0, :, :] -= mean[0]
                x[1, :, :] -= mean[1]
                x[2, :, :] -= mean[2]
                if std is not None:
                    x[0, :, :] /= std[0]
                    x[1, :, :] /= std[1]
                    x[2, :, :] /= std[2]
            else:
                x[:, 0, :, :] -= mean[0]
                x[:, 1, :, :] -= mean[1]
                x[:, 2, :, :] -= mean[2]
                if std is not None:
                    x[:, 0, :, :] /= std[0]
                    x[:, 1, :, :] /= std[1]
                    x[:, 2, :, :] /= std[2]
        else:
            x[..., 0] -= mean[0]
            x[..., 1] -= mean[1]
            x[..., 2] -= mean[2]
            if std is not None:
                x[..., 0] /= std[0]
                x[..., 1] /= std[1]
                x[..., 2] /= std[2]
    return x
```

This corrected version ensures that the `mean` and `std` arrays are of the same dtype as the input `x`, preventing any data type mismatch errors.
