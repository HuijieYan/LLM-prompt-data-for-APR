### Analysis
- The buggy function `_preprocess_numpy_input` is responsible for preprocesssing a batch of images represented by a Numpy array.
- There are different modes: 'tf', 'torch', or default 'caffe', which perform specific preprocessing steps on the input array.
- The bug occurs when the function tries to subtract the mean from the input array. This operation causes a data type mismatch error due to division leading to float values which cannot be cast directly to the original integer data type.
- The bug manifests when the `mode` is not 'tf' or 'torch' and the input array is in 'channels_last' format.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to modify the calculation of normalized pixel values and ensure that the data type is preserved throughout the processing. Specifically, we should ensure that the output array maintains the same data type as the input array.

### Updated Function
```python
def _preprocess_numpy_input(x, data_format, mode):
    """Preprocesses a Numpy array encoding a batch of images.

    # Arguments
        x: Input array, 3D or 4D.
        data_format: Data format of the image array.
        mode: One of "caffe", "tf" or "torch".
            - caffe: will convert the images from RGB to BGR,
                then will zero-center each color channel with
                respect to the ImageNet dataset,
                without scaling.
            - tf: will scale pixels between -1 and 1,
                sample-wise.
            - torch: will scale pixels between 0 and 1 and then
                will normalize each channel with respect to the
                ImageNet dataset.

    # Returns
        Preprocessed Numpy array.
    """
    x = x.astype('float32')  # Ensure data is in float32

    if mode == 'tf':
        x /= 127.5
        x -= 1.
        return x

    if mode == 'torch':
        x /= 255.
        mean = [0.485, 0.456, 0.406]
        std = [0.229, 0.224, 0.225]
    else:
        if data_format == 'channels_first':
            # 'RGB'->'BGR'
            if x.ndim == 3:
                x = x[::-1, ...]
            else:
                x = x[:, ::-1, ...]
        else:
            # 'RGB'->'BGR'
            x = x[..., ::-1]
        mean = [103.939, 116.779, 123.68]
        std = None

    # Zero-center by mean pixel
    x -= mean
    if std is not None:
        x /= std

    return x
```

By ensuring that the input array is converted to `float32` at the beginning, we avoid the data type mismatch error during further operations. This updated function should correctly preprocess the input array as expected in all given cases.
