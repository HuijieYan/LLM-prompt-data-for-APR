### Bug Analysis:
In the `_preprocess_numpy_input` function, the bug occurs when the input array `x` is of type `int32` and the `mode` is set to `'caffe'`. The bug arises when attempting to subtract the `mean` values from the input array of type `int32`, which results in a data type mismatch error when the function tries to subtract a `float64` value (`mean[0]`) from an `int32` array.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the input array `x` is of type `float32` instead of `int32` before performing operations that involve subtracting float values. We can achieve this by explicitly converting the input array `x` to `float32` at the beginning of the function.

### Corrected Function:
```python
import numpy as np

def _preprocess_numpy_input(x, data_format, mode):
    """Preprocesses a Numpy array encoding a batch of images.

    # Arguments
        x: Input array, 3D or 4D.
        data_format: Data format of the image array.
        mode: One of "caffe", "tf" or "torch".
            - caffe: will convert the images from RGB to BGR,
                then will zero-center each color channel with
                respect to the ImageNet dataset,
                without scaling.
            - tf: will scale pixels between -1 and 1,
                sample-wise.
            - torch: will scale pixels between 0 and 1 and then
                will normalize each channel with respect to the
                ImageNet dataset.

    # Returns
        Preprocessed Numpy array.

By explicitly converting the input array `x` to `float32` at the beginning of the function, we ensure that the subsequent calculations involving subtraction of floating-point values are valid and prevent the data type mismatch error.
