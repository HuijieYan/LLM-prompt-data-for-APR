### Analyzing the buggy function and error message
- The buggy function `_preprocess_numpy_input` is intended to preprocess a Numpy array encoding a batch of images based on the specified `data_format` and `mode`.
- The error message indicates a `UFuncTypeError` caused by trying to cast ufunc 'subtract' output from dtype('float64') to dtype('int32') in line 178.
- The function fails when trying to subtract mean pixel values from the input array.
- The expected values and types during the failing test are also provided for various scenarios with different data formats and modes.

### Bug Cause
- The bug is caused by modifying a numpy array representing image data (`x`) in place using floating-point arithmetic while maintaining an integer data type.
- The subtraction operation with floating-point mean values causes the output to become float64, which cannot be cast directly back to the original int32 data type if `x` is initially an integer array.

### Strategy for fixing the bug
- Ensure that all intermediate calculations during preprocessing are performed with floating-point precision to avoid data type conflicts.
- Maintain the data type consistency by ensuring that the transformed data corresponds to the expected input/output types.

### Corrected Function
```python
import numpy as np

def _preprocess_numpy_input(x, data_format, mode):
    if x.dtype == np.uint8:
        x = x.astype(np.float32)

    if mode == 'tf':
        x /= 127.5
        x -= 1.
        return x

    if mode == 'torch':
        x /= 255.
        mean = np.array([0.485, 0.456, 0.406], dtype=np.float32)
        std = np.array([0.229, 0.224, 0.225], dtype=np.float32)
    else:
        if data_format == 'channels_first':
            # 'RGB'->'BGR'
            if x.ndim == 3:
                x = x[::-1, ...]
            else:
                x = x[:, ::-1, ...]
        else:
            # 'RGB'->'BGR'
            x = x[..., ::-1]
        mean = np.array([103.939, 116.779, 123.68], dtype=np.float32)
        std = None

    x -= mean
    if std is not None:
        x /= std
    
    return x
```

This corrected function ensures that all arithmetic operations are performed using floating-point precision to avoid data type conflicts. Additionally, it handles cases where the input needs to be converted to float32 before processing.
