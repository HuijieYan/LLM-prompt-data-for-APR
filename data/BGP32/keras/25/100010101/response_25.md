### Analysis
1. The function `_preprocess_numpy_input` is designed to preprocess a Numpy array encoding a batch of images based on the given `mode` and `data_format`.
2. The error message indicates that there is a `UFuncTypeError` when trying to perform subtraction on an array element with a different data type.
3. The function incorrectly assumes that the input array `x` will always be of type `float` while performing arithmetic operations, leading to data type issues with `int32` type input.
4. To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the input array `x` is explicitly converted to the float data type before performing arithmetic operations to prevent type conflicts.
5. We can address this issue by explicitly converting `x` to the float type at the beginning of the function, ensuring consistent data type handling throughout the preprocessing steps.

### Correction
```python
import numpy as np

def _preprocess_numpy_input(x, data_format, mode):
    """Preprocesses a Numpy array encoding a batch of images.

    # Arguments
        x: Input array, 3D or 4D.
        data_format: Data format of the image array.
        mode: One of "caffe", "tf" or "torch".
            - caffe: will convert the images from RGB to BGR,
                then will zero-center each color channel with
                respect to the ImageNet dataset,
                without scaling.
            - tf: will scale pixels between -1 and 1,
                sample-wise.
            - torch: will scale pixels between 0 and 1 and then
                will normalize each channel with respect to the
                ImageNet dataset.

By explicitly converting the input array `x` to `float32` type at the beginning of the function, we ensure consistent data type handling throughout the preprocessing steps, preventing any `UFuncTypeError` caused by type conflicts.
