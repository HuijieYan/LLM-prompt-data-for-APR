### Bug Analysis:
- The bug occurs when the input array `x` is of type `int32` and the mode is set to `'torch'`. This results in a type mismatch when trying to perform arithmetic operations on `int32` and floating-point numbers, leading to a `UFuncTypeError`.
- The bug is specifically arising from the line `x[..., 0] -= mean[0]` where the `mean` values are floating-point numbers and `x` is of type `int32`.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
- To fix the bug, we need to ensure that all arithmetic operations are done on arrays of the same data type. In this case, we should convert `x` to a floating-point array before performing the operations by changing `x`'s data type to `float32`.

### Corrected Function:
```python
def _preprocess_numpy_input(x, data_format, mode):
    """Preprocesses a Numpy array encoding a batch of images.

    # Arguments
        x: Input array, 3D or 4D.
        data_format: Data format of the image array.
        mode: One of "caffe", "tf" or "torch".
            - caffe: will convert the images from RGB to BGR,
                then will zero-center each color channel with
                respect to the ImageNet dataset,
                without scaling.
            - tf: will scale pixels between -1 and 1,
                sample-wise.
            - torch: will scale pixels between 0 and 1 and then
                will normalize each channel with respect to the
                ImageNet dataset.

    # Returns
        Preprocessed Numpy array.

The corrected function includes a type conversion of the input array `x` to `float32` to avoid the type mismatch issue in the arithmetic operations. This modification ensures that all operations are done on arrays of the same data type, resolving the bug.
