### Analysis:
1. The bug occurs when the function tries to subtract the mean value from the input array `x` and assign the result back to the same variable. The problem arises when the mean value is of `float` type and the input array `x` is of `int32` type, leading to a type mismatch error.
2. The buggy function `_preprocess_numpy_input` is designed to preprocess images based on different modes and data formats, but it fails to handle the type conversion appropriately in the case of integer input arrays.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that arithmetic operations like subtraction between the mean values and the input array `x` are performed using compatible data types. We can achieve this by explicitly converting `x` to a floating-point type before performing arithmetic operations.

### Corrected Function:
```python
import numpy as np

def _preprocess_numpy_input(x, data_format, mode):
    """Preprocesses a Numpy array encoding a batch of images.

    # Arguments
        x: Input array, 3D or 4D.
        data_format: Data format of the image array.
        mode: One of "caffe", "tf" or "torch".
            - caffe: will convert the images from RGB to BGR,
                then will zero-center each color channel with
                respect to the ImageNet dataset,
                without scaling.
            - tf: will scale pixels between -1 and 1,
                sample-wise.
            - torch: will scale pixels between 0 and 1 and then
                will normalize each channel with respect to the
                ImageNet dataset.

    # Returns
        Preprocessed Numpy array.
    """
    x = x.astype(np.float32)  # convert input to float32 for safe arithmetic operations

    if mode == 'tf':
        x /= 127.5
        x -= 1.
        return x

    if mode == 'torch':
        x /= 255.
        mean = np.array([0.485, 0.456, 0.406], dtype=np.float32)
        std = np.array([0.229, 0.224, 0.225], dtype=np.float32)
    else:
        if data_format == 'channels_first':
            # 'RGB'->'BGR'
            x = np.flip(x, axis=-3)
        else:
            # 'RGB'->'BGR'
            x = np.flip(x, axis=-1)
        mean = np.array([103.939, 116.779, 123.68], dtype=np.float32)
        std = None

    # Zero-center by mean pixel
    x -= mean
    if std is not None:
        x /= std

    return x
```

Now, the corrected function explicitly converts the input array `x` to `float32` before performing the arithmetic operations. This ensures compatibility between data types and fixes the bug that caused the type mismatch error.
