### Analysis
- The error message indicates a `UFuncTypeError` when trying to perform a subtraction operation on an `int32` array `x` with a `dtype('float64')` value `mean[0]`.
- The function is intended to preprocess input images based on the chosen `mode` and `data_format`.
- Based on the error message, we can infer that converting `x` to a float type before performing the subtraction could solve the issue.
- The error occurs in the part where the mean subtraction is performed on the input array `x`.

### Bug Fix Strategy
- Convert the input array `x` to a float type before performing any arithmetic operations.
- Check the data format and apply the appropriate transformations based on the selected mode.

### Bug-free updated function

```python
import numpy as np

def _preprocess_numpy_input(x, data_format, mode):
    """Preprocesses a Numpy array encoding a batch of images.

    # Arguments
        x: Input array, 3D or 4D.
        data_format: Data format of the image array.
        mode: One of "caffe", "tf" or "torch".
            - caffe: will convert the images from RGB to BGR,
                then will zero-center each color channel with
                respect to the ImageNet dataset,
                without scaling.
            - tf: will scale pixels between -1 and 1,
                sample-wise.
            - torch: will scale pixels between 0 and 1 and then
                will normalize each channel with respect to the
                ImageNet dataset.
