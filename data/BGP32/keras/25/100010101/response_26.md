### Potential Error location:
The error seems to occur when trying to subtract the mean value from the input array `x`, leading to a conversion error between `float64` and `int32`.

### Cause of the Bug:
The bug is caused by trying to perform operations that involve float division or subtraction on an `int32` array without explicitly converting it to a float type. This leads to a type conversion issue when trying to subtract a float value (`mean`) from an integer array.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the input array `x` is correctly handled as a float array before performing division or subtraction operations. This can involve explicitly converting the input array to a float type at the beginning of the function or ensuring that intermediate calculations maintain float data types.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
import numpy as np

def _preprocess_numpy_input(x, data_format, mode):
    """Preprocesses a Numpy array encoding a batch of images.

    # Arguments
        x: Input array, 3D or 4D.
        data_format: Data format of the image array.
        mode: One of "caffe", "tf" or "torch".
            - caffe: will convert the images from RGB to BGR,
                then will zero-center each color channel with
                respect to the ImageNet dataset,
                without scaling.
            - tf: will scale pixels between -1 and 1,
                sample-wise.
            - torch: will scale pixels between 0 and 1 and then
                will normalize each channel with respect to the
                ImageNet dataset.

        Preprocessed Numpy array.

By explicitly converting the input array `x` to `float32` at the beginning of the function, we ensure that all operations thereafter are performed with float data types, avoiding the type conversion error.
