### Analysis:
The buggy function `_preprocess_numpy_input` is designed to preprocess a numpy array encoding a batch of images based on the provided `mode` and `data_format`. The error occurs when the function tries to subtract the mean from the input array `x` while operating on an integer array, resulting in a typecasting error. This issue is due to the mismatch in data types between the mean values, which are floats, and the input array `x`, which might be integers in some cases.

### Error Cause:
The cause of the bug is the attempt to subtract float values from an integer array. This occurs when the input array `x` is of type `int32` and the function tries to subtract the mean values, which are float numbers. This leads to a typecasting error, specifically a `UFuncTypeError`.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the array `x` and the mean values are of the same data type before performing any operations. One way to achieve this is by converting the input array `x` to float type before normalizing it with the mean values. This approach will prevent any typecasting errors during the subtraction operation.

### Corrected Function:
```python
import numpy as np

def _preprocess_numpy_input(x, data_format, mode):
    """Preprocesses a Numpy array encoding a batch of images.

    # Arguments
        x: Input array, 3D or 4D.
        data_format: Data format of the image array.
        mode: One of "caffe", "tf" or "torch".
            - caffe: will convert the images from RGB to BGR,
                then will zero-center each color channel with
                respect to the ImageNet dataset,
                without scaling.
            - tf: will scale pixels between -1 and 1,
                sample-wise.
            - torch: will scale pixels between 0 and 1 and then
                will normalize each channel with respect to the
                ImageNet dataset.

After applying the specified modifications to the `preprocess_numpy_input` function, it should prevent the typecasting error that caused the test case failures.
