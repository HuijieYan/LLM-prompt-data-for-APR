## Cause of the bug:
The bug occurs when the function encounters an unexpected data type conversion error during the subtraction operation on the input array `x`. The error message specifically mentions that there is a "Cannot cast ufunc 'subtract' output from dtype('float64') to dtype('int32') with casting rule 'same_kind'" error. This error arises from trying to subtract a floating-point number from an integer value in the NumPy array `x`.

## Bug fix strategy:
To fix this bug, we need to ensure that all the calculations within the function are performed using a consistent data type to avoid the type conversion error. Specifically, we need to make sure that the mean values and standard deviation values are in the same data type as the input array `x` before performing any arithmetic operations.

## Corrected version of the function:

```python
import numpy as np

def _preprocess_numpy_input(x, data_format, mode):
    """Preprocesses a Numpy array encoding a batch of images.

    # Arguments
        x: Input array, 3D or 4D.
        data_format: Data format of the image array.
        mode: One of "caffe", "tf" or "torch".
            - caffe: will convert the images from RGB to BGR,
                then will zero-center each color channel with
                respect to the ImageNet dataset,
                without scaling.
            - tf: will scale pixels between -1 and 1,
                sample-wise.
            - torch: will scale pixels between 0 and 1 and then
                will normalize each channel with respect to the
                ImageNet dataset.

    # Returns
        Preprocessed Numpy array.
    """
    x = np.array(x, dtype=np.float32)  # Ensure x is of float32 type
    if mode == 'tf':
        x /= 127.5
        x -= 1.
        return x

    if mode == 'torch':
        x /= 255.
        mean = np.array([0.485, 0.456, 0.406], dtype=np.float32)
        std = np.array([0.229, 0.224, 0.225], dtype=np.float32)
    else:
        if data_format == 'channels_first':
            if x.ndim == 3:
                x = x[:, ::-1, ...]
            else:
                x = x[:, :, ::-1, ...]
        else:
            x = x[..., ::-1]
        mean = np.array([103.939, 116.779, 123.68], dtype=np.float32)
        std = None

    if data_format == 'channels_first':
        x -= mean[:, None, None]
        if std is not None:
            x /= std[:, None, None]
    else:
        x -= mean
        if std is not None:
            x /= std

    return x
```

By this correction, we ensure that the input array `x` is converted to `float32` type at the beginning of the function. We also adjust the operations based on the "channels_first" or "channels_last" data format. This should resolve the data type conversion error and allow the function to preprocess the input array correctly for the specified `mode`.
