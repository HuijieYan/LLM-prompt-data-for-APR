### Error Analysis:
The buggy function `_preprocess_numpy_input` is incorrectly modifying the input array `x` based on the `data_format` and `mode` parameters. The error occurs when trying to subtract the mean values from the input array `x` which leads to a type casting error due to the mixed data types (float64 and int32).

### Bug:
The bug arises from attempting to modify the input array `x` in a way that leads to type compatibility issues when subtracting the mean values from it.

### Fix Strategy:
To solve the bug, we should ensure that the input array `x` is transformed into a float-type array (e.g., float32) prior to performing any operations that involve floating-point calculations (such as subtraction of mean values).

### Corrected Function:
```python
import numpy as np

def _preprocess_numpy_input(x, data_format, mode):
    """Preprocesses a Numpy array encoding a batch of images.

    # Arguments
        x: Input array, 3D or 4D.
        data_format: Data format of the image array.
        mode: One of "caffe", "tf" or "torch".
            - caffe: will convert the images from RGB to BGR,
                then will zero-center each color channel with
                respect to the ImageNet dataset,
                without scaling.
            - tf: will scale pixels between -1 and 1,
                sample-wise.
            - torch: will scale pixels between 0 and 1 and then
                will normalize each channel with respect to the
                ImageNet dataset.

    # Returns
        Preprocessed Numpy array.

By converting the input array `x` to float32 at the beginning of the `_preprocess_numpy_input` function, we ensure that subsequent operations will not result in any type casting issues, fixing the bug reported in the failing test case.
