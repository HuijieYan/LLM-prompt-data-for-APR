### Analysis
The bug in this function is causing a "UFuncTypeError" due to invalid casting from 'float64' to 'int32' when attempting to subtract the mean from the input 'x'. The bug is related to the datatype mismatch between 'float64' and 'int32'.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix this bug, we need to ensure that 'x' is converted to 'float32' datatype before performing any arithmetic operations. This will prevent the casting error that occurs when trying to subtract mean values from an 'int32' array. To achieve this, we can use the 'astype' method to convert 'x' to 'float32' before any arithmetic operations.

### Corrected Function
```python
import numpy as np

def _preprocess_numpy_input(x, data_format, mode):
    """Preprocesses a Numpy array encoding a batch of images.

    # Arguments
        x: Input array, 3D or 4D.
        data_format: Data format of the image array.
        mode: One of "caffe", "tf" or "torch".
            - caffe: will convert the images from RGB to BGR,
                then will zero-center each color channel with
                respect to the ImageNet dataset,
                without scaling.
            - tf: will scale pixels between -1 and 1,
                sample-wise.
            - torch: will scale pixels between 0 and 1 and then
                will normalize each channel with respect to the
                ImageNet dataset.

    # Returns
        Preprocessed Numpy array.
    """
    x = x.astype('float32')  # Convert input to float32

    if mode == 'tf':
        x /= 127.5
        x -= 1.
        return x

    if mode == 'torch':
        x /= 255.
        mean = [0.485, 0.456, 0.406]
        std = [0.229, 0.224, 0.225]
    else:
        if data_format == 'channels_first':

            if x.ndim == 3:
                x = x[::-1, ...]
            else:
                x = x[:, ::-1, ...]

            x = x[..., ::-1]

    if data_format == 'channels_first':
        if x.ndim == 3:
            x[0, :, :] -= mean[0]
            x[1, :, :] -= mean[1]
            x[2, :, :] -= mean[2]
            if std is not None:
                x[0, :, :] /= std[0]
                x[1, :, :] /= std[1]
                x[2, :, :] /= std[2]

                x[:, 0, :, :] /= std[0]

    return x
```

Now, after making this correction, the function should handle input data of type 'int32' correctly and avoid the UFuncTypeError by converting it to 'float32' before performing arithmetic operations. The corrected function should pass all the provided test cases successfully.
