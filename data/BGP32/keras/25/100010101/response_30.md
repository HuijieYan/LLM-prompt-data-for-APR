### Bug analysis
- The error message indicates a `UFuncTypeError`, suggesting a failure in casting while performing the subtraction operation on the variable `x`.
- The bug occurs when attempting to subtract values of type 'float64' from values of type 'int32'.
- The issue arises when calculating the expression `x[..., 0] -= mean[0]`, where `x` is of type `int32` and `mean` is of type `float`.
- The expected behavior should be consistent with the preprocessing logic to normalize values correctly.

### Bug fix strategy
- To resolve the bug, we need to ensure that the types of the variables involved in the subtraction operation are compatible.
- Convert the input `x` to float before performing any calculations to maintain data type consistency.
- Handle the casting between different data types appropriately to prevent the type mismatch error.

### Corrected function
```python
import numpy as np

def _preprocess_numpy_input(x, data_format, mode):
    """Preprocesses a Numpy array encoding a batch of images.

    # Arguments
        x: Input array, 3D or 4D.
        data_format: Data format of the image array.
        mode: One of "caffe", "tf" or "torch".
            - caffe: will convert the images from RGB to BGR,
                then will zero-center each color channel with
                respect to the ImageNet dataset,
                without scaling.
            - tf: will scale pixels between -1 and 1,
                sample-wise.
            - torch: will scale pixels between 0 and 1 and then
                will normalize each channel with respect to the
                ImageNet dataset.

    # Returns
        Preprocessed Numpy array.
    """
    x = x.astype('float32')  # Convert to float to ensure compatibility

    if mode == 'tf':
        x /= 127.5
        x -= 1.
        return x

    if mode == 'torch':
        x /= 255.
        mean = np.array([0.485, 0.456, 0.406], dtype='float32')
        std = np.array([0.229, 0.224, 0.225], dtype='float32')
    else:
        if data_format == 'channels_first':
            # 'RGB'->'BGR'
            x = x[:, ::-1, ...]
        else:
            # 'RGB'->'BGR'
            x = x[..., ::-1]
        mean = np.array([103.939, 116.779, 123.68], dtype='float32')
        std = None

    # Zero-center by mean pixel
    x -= mean
    if std is not None:
        x /= std

    return x
```

### The corrected function ensures:
- Type consistency by converting input `x` to float32 at the beginning.
- Proper handling of subtraction and division operations with correct casting.
- Maintaining the expected behavior of preprocessing images based on the specified mode and data format.
