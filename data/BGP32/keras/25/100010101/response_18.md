### Analysis:
- The error occurred due to the mismatched data types when trying to perform arithmetic operations on arrays.
- The input array `x` can be of different data types (either `int` or `float`).
- The function is designed to preprocess the input array based on different modes (`tf`, `torch`, or others) and data formats (`channels_first` or `channels_last`).
- The bug arises in the handling of data format and mode for the different cases, impacting the arithmetic operations on the input array.
- The buggy function is not correctly pre-processing the input array based on the specified data format and mode.
- In Case 1, Case 3, and Case 5, the input array `x` is expected to be of type `float32` after preprocessing according to the specified mode and data format.

### Bug:
The bug arises from the incorrect treatment of input data types (`int` vs. `float32`) and the mismatched arithmetic operations based on the specified mode and data format. The arithmetic operations should be performed consistently on the input array according to the specified mode while considering the data format.

### Fix:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the input array `x` is consistently treated based on the specified mode and data format, regardless of its initial data type. Specifically, we need to ensure that the arithmetic operations are compatible with the data type of the array `x`.

### Corrected version of the function:

```python
import numpy as np

def _preprocess_numpy_input(x, data_format, mode):
    if mode == 'tf':
        x = np.array(x, dtype=np.float32)  # Convert input array to float32
        x /= 127.5
        x -= 1.
        return x

    if mode == 'torch':
        x = np.array(x, dtype=np.float32)  # Convert input array to float32
        x /= 255.
        mean = [0.485, 0.456, 0.406]
        std = [0.229, 0.224, 0.225]
    else:
        x = np.array(x, dtype=np.float32)  # Convert input array to float32
        if data_format == 'channels_first':
            # 'RGB'->'BGR'
            if x.ndim == 3:
                x = x[:, ::-1, ...]
            else:
                x = x[:, :, ::-1, ...]
        else:
            # 'RGB'->'BGR'
            x = x[..., ::-1]
        mean = [103.939, 116.779, 123.68]
        std = None

    # Zero-center by mean pixel
    if data_format == 'channels_first':
        x -= mean
        if std is not None:
            x /= std
    else:
        x -= mean
        if std is not None:
            x /= std
    return x
```

Now the corrected version of the function should handle the input array's data type correctly based on the specified mode and data format, allowing for consistent preprocessing and avoiding mismatched data type errors.
