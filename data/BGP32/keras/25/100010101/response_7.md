### Analysis:
- The error occurs when trying to subtract the mean value from an ndarray with integer dtype, causing a `UFuncTypeError` due to attempting to cast the output to float64, which is not compatible with the input's int32 dtype.
- The bug lies in the line where the mean is subtracted from the input array based on the `data_format`. The code does not consider the data type of the input array during this operation.
- The bug is present in the conditional statement that handles the 'torch' mode, which is outside the 'tf' mode conditions that correctly handle the float input.
- To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the input array is converted to float before performing calculations that involve subtraction by mean values.

### Bug Fix:
```python
import numpy as np

def _preprocess_numpy_input(x, data_format, mode):
    """Preprocesses a Numpy array encoding a batch of images.

    # Arguments
        x: Input array, 3D or 4D.
        data_format: Data format of the image array.
        mode: One of "caffe", "tf" or "torch".
            - caffe: will convert the images from RGB to BGR,
                then will zero-center each color channel with
                respect to the ImageNet dataset,
                without scaling.
            - tf: will scale pixels between -1 and 1,
                sample-wise.
            - torch: will scale pixels between 0 and 1 and then
                will normalize each channel with respect to the
                ImageNet dataset.

After applying the fix, the function will correctly convert the input array to `float32`, allowing the subtraction operations to be performed properly without causing type casting issues. The function should now pass all the failing test cases and satisfy the expected input/output values.
