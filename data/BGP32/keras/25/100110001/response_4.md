### Analysis:
- The error message indicates a UFuncTypeError related to casting an output from 'float64' to 'int32'.
- The failing test specifically calls the `utils.preprocess_input(xint)` function with an input array of type 'int32'.
- Looking at the `_preprocess_numpy_input` function, there is a calculation operation, `x[..., 0] -= mean[0]`, that might be causing this issue when dealing with 'int32' type input data.

### Bug Cause:
- The bug occurs because the operation `x[..., 0] -= mean[0]` is trying to subtract a floating-point number from elements of an array that are integers. This operation results in a mix of integer and floating-point values, which causes the casting error.

### Bug Fix:
- To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the input array `x` is treated appropriately based on its data type in the preprocessing calculations. 
- Specifically, when `x` is of type 'int32', we should first convert it to a floating-point type before performing operations that involve floating-point numbers.
- Additionally, we should handle the case where `std` is None to avoid division by zero.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def _preprocess_numpy_input(x, data_format, mode):
    """Preprocesses a Numpy array encoding a batch of images.

    # Arguments
        x: Input array, 3D or 4D.
        data_format: Data format of the image array.
        mode: One of "caffe", "tf" or "torch".
            - caffe: will convert the images from RGB to BGR,
                then will zero-center each color channel with
                respect to the ImageNet dataset,
                without scaling.
            - tf: will scale pixels between -1 and 1,
                sample-wise.
            - torch: will scale pixels between 0 and 1 and then
                will normalize each channel with respect to the
                ImageNet dataset.

By updating the `_preprocess_numpy_input` function with the corrected version above, we ensure that the input array is handled correctly based on its data type and avoid the casting error encountered in the failing test.
