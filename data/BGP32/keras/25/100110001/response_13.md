### Analysis:
1. The failing test is checking if the shape of the preprocessed input matches the original input shape.
2. The error occurs specifically when `mode='torch'` and `data_format=='channels_last'`.
3. The error message indicates a `UFuncTypeError`, specifically when trying to subtract a float value from an array of integers.
4. The bug is related to the inconsistent data types (float and int) when performing operations on the input array.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
- We need to ensure that all operations are consistent with the data types present in the input array.
- Convert the input array to float before performing any division or subtraction operations.

### Bug-fixed Function:
```python
import numpy as np

def _preprocess_numpy_input(x, data_format, mode):
    """Preprocesses a Numpy array encoding a batch of images.

    # Arguments
        x: Input array, 3D or 4D.
        data_format: Data format of the image array.
        mode: One of "caffe", "tf" or "torch".
            - caffe: will convert the images from RGB to BGR,
                then will zero-center each color channel with
                respect to the ImageNet dataset,
                without scaling.
            - tf: will scale pixels between -1 and 1,
                sample-wise.
            - torch: will scale pixels between 0 and 1 and then
                will normalize each channel with respect to the
                ImageNet dataset.

After fixing the bug in the `_preprocess_numpy_input` function as described above, the corrected version should pass the failing test without raising the `UFuncTypeError`.
