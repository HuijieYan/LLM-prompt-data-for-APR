### Analysis:
1. The failing test is trying to preprocess an input numpy array using the `preprocess_input` function.
2. The failing test detected an error when processing an input numpy array of integer dtype.
3. The failing test error message points to a `UFuncTypeError` where there is an issue with casting a float64 dtype to an int32 dtype within the `_preprocess_numpy_input` function.
4. The root cause of the bug is in the `torch` mode where the input array is divided by 255 (a float operation) leading to float64 dtype and then directly subtracted from `mean` which is of type float, causing the error when trying to subtract from an integer input array.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix this bug, we need to ensure that when `mode` is set to `'torch'`, we handle the input array type conversion properly to avoid issues with mixing float and integer operations on the input array. Specifically, we need to convert the input array to a float type before performing the preprocessing steps related to the `torch` mode.

### Corrected Function:
```python
def _preprocess_numpy_input(x, data_format, mode):
    """Preprocesses a Numpy array encoding a batch of images.

    # Arguments
        x: Input array, 3D or 4D.
        data_format: Data format of the image array.
        mode: One of "caffe", "tf" or "torch".
            - caffe: will convert the images from RGB to BGR,
                then will zero-center each color channel with
                respect to the ImageNet dataset,
                without scaling.
            - tf: will scale pixels between -1 and 1,
                sample-wise.
            - torch: will scale pixels between 0 and 1 and then
                will normalize each channel with respect to the
                ImageNet dataset.

By adding a check to convert integer input arrays to float arrays before processing, we avoid the issue of mixing float and integer operations on the input array. This correction should fix the bug encountered during the failing test.
