### Analysis:
The error occurs when trying to subtract the mean value from the input image array `x` with data type `int32`, causing a `UFuncTypeError` due to the data type mismatch during the subtraction operation in the `_preprocess_numpy_input` function.

### Potential Error Locations:
The error occurs in the section of code where the mean pixel values are subtracted from the input array `x`.

### Cause of the Bug:
The bug is caused by the data type mismatch between the mean values (float) and the input array `x` (int32) when trying to perform subtraction operations in the part of the code where mean values are subtracted from the input image array. This leads to the error message as the subtraction operation cannot be performed due to the data type mismatch.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix this bug, ensure that the mean values are of the same data type as the input image array `x` before performing any subtraction operations. This can be achieved by converting the mean values to the same data type as `x` before subtraction.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def _preprocess_numpy_input(x, data_format, mode):
    """Preprocesses a Numpy array encoding a batch of images.

    # Arguments
        x: Input array, 3D or 4D.
        data_format: Data format of the image array.
        mode: One of "caffe", "tf" or "torch".
            - caffe: will convert the images from RGB to BGR,
                then will zero-center each color channel with
                respect to the ImageNet dataset,
                without scaling.
            - tf: will scale pixels between -1 and 1,
                sample-wise.
            - torch: will scale pixels between 0 and 1 and then
                will normalize each channel with respect to the
                ImageNet dataset.

This corrected version explicitly converts the mean values to `float32` before performing the subtraction operation with the input array `x`, ensuring data type compatibility and resolving the `UFuncTypeError`.
