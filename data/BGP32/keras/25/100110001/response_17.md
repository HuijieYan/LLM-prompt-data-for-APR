### Analysis:
1. The failing test `test_preprocess_input` is checking the output shape of the `preprocess_input` function, specifically for a numpy array with `int32` data type.
2. The error message indicates that there is a type error during subtraction in the `_preprocess_numpy_input` function when the data type is converted from `float64` to `int32`.
3. The bug is in the `_preprocess_numpy_input` function, more specifically in the calculation of mean pixel subtraction when the data type of the input `x` is not consistent with the expected type.
4. To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the type conversion is handled correctly when subtracting the mean pixel values.

### Correction:
```python
import numpy as np

def _preprocess_numpy_input(x, data_format, mode):
    if mode == 'tf':
        x /= 127.5
        x -= 1.
        return x

    if mode == 'torch':
        x = x.astype('float32') / 255.  # Convert to float before division
        mean = np.array([0.485, 0.456, 0.406], dtype=x.dtype)  # Match dtype with x
        std = np.array([0.229, 0.224, 0.225], dtype=x.dtype)  # Match dtype with x
    else:
        if data_format == 'channels_first':
            if x.ndim == 3:
                x = x[::-1, ...]
            else:
                x = x[:, ::-1, ...]
        else:
            x = x[..., ::-1]
        mean = np.array([103.939, 116.779, 123.68], dtype=x.dtype)  # Match dtype with x
        std = None

    if std is not None:
        x -= mean
        x /= std
    else:
        x -= mean

    return x

# Ensure the correction is working by running the test function again
test_preprocess_input()
```

This correction handles the type conversion correctly and ensures that the mean and std values are in the same data type as the input `x`. After implementing this correction, the error related to type conversion during subtraction should be resolved.
