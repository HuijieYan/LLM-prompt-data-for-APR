### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_preprocess_numpy_input` is responsible for preprocessing a Numpy array encoding a batch of images based on the provided data format and mode.
2. The failing test `test_preprocess_input` attempts to preprocess input images using the `utils.preprocess_input` function.
3. The error message indicates that there is a type casting issue when subtracting the mean value from the input array, leading to the failure of the test.

### Bug Cause:
The bug occurs when the function tries to subtract the mean value from the input array with a data type of `int32`. The mean values are float numbers, and when subtracting them from the `int32` type array directly, a type casting error occurs.

### Bug Fix:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the mean values are used as float numbers when performing arithmetic operations with the input array. This can be achieved by explicitly converting the mean values to float before performing the subtraction.

### Corrected Function:
```python
def _preprocess_numpy_input(x, data_format, mode):
    if mode == 'tf':
        x /= 127.5
        x -= 1.
        return x

    if mode == 'torch':
        x = x.astype('float32')  # Ensure x is float for arithmetic operations
        x /= 255.
        mean = [0.485, 0.456, 0.406]
        std = [0.229, 0.224, 0.225]
    else:
        if data_format == 'channels_first':
            if x.ndim == 3:
                x = x[::-1, ...]
            else:
                x = x[:, ::-1, ...]
        else:
            x = x[..., ::-1]
        mean = [103.939, 116.779, 123.68]
        std = None

    if data_format == 'channels_first':
        if x.ndim == 3:
            x[0, :, :] -= mean[0]
            x[1, :, :] -= mean[1]
            x[2, :, :] -= mean[2]
            if std is not None:
                x[0, :, :] /= std[0]
                x[1, :, :] /= std[1]
                x[2, :, :] /= std[2]
        else:
            x[:, 0, :, :] -= mean[0]
            x[:, 1, :, :] -= mean[1]
            x[:, 2, :, :] -= mean[2]
            if std is not None:
                x[:, 0, :, :] /= std[0]
                x[:, 1, :, :] /= std[1]
                x[:, 2, :, :] /= std[2]
    else:
        x[..., 0] -= mean[0]
        x[..., 1] -= mean[1]
        x[..., 2] -= mean[2]
        if std is not None:
            x[..., 0] /= std[0]
            x[..., 1] /= std[1]
            x[..., 2] /= std[2]
    return x
```

By converting `x` to `float32` explicitly when the mode is 'torch', we ensure that the arithmetic operations don't trigger a type casting error with `int32` input arrays. This modification should fix the bug and allow the function to preprocess input images correctly.
