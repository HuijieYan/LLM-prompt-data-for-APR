The bug in the `_preprocess_numpy_input` function arises from the incorrect handling of data format and pixel normalization based on the given mode. The error message indicates that there is an issue with casting types when applying subtraction in the case where `mode = 'torch'` and `data_format = 'channels_last'`.

The cause of the bug is that when `mode = 'torch'` and the `data_format = 'channels_last'`, the function tries to subtract the mean pixel values (`mean`) from the numpy array `x`, which might have integer type elements due to the random generation process, causing a type casting error when trying to subtract a float value from an integer value.

To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the input array `x` is converted to float type before any arithmetic operation.

Here is the corrected version of the `_preprocess_numpy_input` function:

```python
def _preprocess_numpy_input(x, data_format, mode):
    if mode == 'tf':
        x = x.astype('float32')
        x /= 127.5
        x -= 1.
        return x

    if mode == 'torch':
        x = x.astype('float32')
        x /= 255.
        mean = [0.485, 0.456, 0.406]
        std = [0.229, 0.224, 0.225]
    else:
        ...
```

By converting `x` to float type using `x = x.astype('float32')` before performing any arithmetic operation, we ensure that the subtraction and division operations do not cause any type casting errors. This correction should resolve the issue and make the function work correctly with the provided test case.
