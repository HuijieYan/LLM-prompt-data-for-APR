### Analysis:
1. The failing test calls the `utils.preprocess_input` function with an input of type `int32`.
2. The error message indicates a `UFuncTypeError` when trying to subtract `mean[0]` from `x[..., 0]`, due to the mismatch between the data types `int32` and `float64`.

### Bug:
The bug occurs in the `_preprocess_numpy_input` function when trying to subtract a floating-point value from an integer array, resulting in a data type mismatch error.

### Fix:
To fix the bug, ensure that the input array `x` is cast to a floating-point type before performing arithmetic operations on it. This will prevent the data type mismatch error.

### Corrected Version:
```python
import numpy as np

def _preprocess_numpy_input(x, data_format, mode):
    if mode == 'tf':
        x = x.astype('float32')
        x /= 127.5
        x -= 1.
        return x

    if mode == 'torch':
        x = x.astype('float32')
        x /= 255.
        mean = np.array([0.485, 0.456, 0.406])
        std = np.array([0.229, 0.224, 0.225])
    else:
        if data_format == 'channels_first':
            if x.ndim == 3:
                x = x[::-1, ...]
            else:
                x = x[:, ::-1, ...]
        else:
            x = x[..., ::-1]
        mean = np.array([103.939, 116.779, 123.68])
        std = None

    if x.dtype != 'float32':
        x = x.astype('float32')

    if std is not None:
        if data_format == 'channels_first':
            for i in range(x.shape[0]):
                for j in range(x.shape[1]):
                    x[:, i, j] /= std[j]
        else:
            for i in range(x.shape[0]):
                for j in range(x.shape[1]):
                    x[i, j, :] /= std[j]

    for i in range(x.shape[-1]):
        x[..., i] -= mean[i]

    return x
``` 

This corrected version ensures that the input array `x` is converted to a floating-point data type before any arithmetic operations, preventing data type mismatch errors.
