The buggy function `_preprocess_numpy_input` is generating a `UFuncTypeError` when trying to subtract the mean value from the input numpy array `x`. The error occurs when the type of `x` is an int32 array and the mean value is a float value.

To fix this issue, we should ensure that the mean values are of the same type as the input `x` before performing any subtraction. We can cast the mean values to the same type as `x` before performing the subtraction operation.

Here is the corrected version of the `_preprocess_numpy_input` function:

```python
def _preprocess_numpy_input(x, data_format, mode):
    if mode == 'tf':
        x = x.astype('float64')
        x /= 127.5
        x -= 1.
        return x

    if mode == 'torch':
        x = x.astype('float64')
        x /= 255.
        mean = np.array([0.485, 0.456, 0.406], dtype=x.dtype)
        std = np.array([0.229, 0.224, 0.225], dtype=x.dtype)
    else:
        x = x.astype('float64')
        if data_format == 'channels_first':
            if x.ndim == 3:
                x = x[::-1, ...]
            else:
                x = x[:, ::-1, ...]
        else:
            x = x[..., ::-1]
        mean = np.array([103.939, 116.779, 123.68], dtype=x.dtype)
        std = None

    if std is not None:
        x -= mean
        x /= std
    else:
        x -= mean

    return x
```

This corrected version of the function casts `x`, mean, and std arrays to the same data type before performing any calculations, ensuring compatibility and preventing type mismatch errors.
