The bug in the `_preprocess_numpy_input` function occurs when the `mode` is set to 'torch' and the `data_format` is not 'channels_first'. The function tries to subtract the mean value from the numpy array `x`, which is of type int32. Since the mean value is of type float64, this leads to a type mismatch error during the subtraction operation.

To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the mean values are applied correctly to the input array `x`. We should convert `x` to a floating-point type before performing the subtraction operation to avoid the type mismatch error.

Here is the corrected version of the `_preprocess_numpy_input` function:

```python
def _preprocess_numpy_input(x, data_format, mode):
    """Preprocesses a Numpy array encoding a batch of images.

    # Arguments
        x: Input array, 3D or 4D.
        data_format: Data format of the image array.
        mode: One of "caffe", "tf" or "torch".
            - caffe: will convert the images from RGB to BGR,
                then will zero-center each color channel with
                respect to the ImageNet dataset,
                without scaling.
            - tf: will scale pixels between -1 and 1,
                sample-wise.
            - torch: will scale pixels between 0 and 1 and then
                will normalize each channel with respect to the
                ImageNet dataset.

    # Returns
        Preprocessed Numpy array.
    """
    x = x.astype('float32')  # Convert input array to float32 type

    if mode == 'tf':
        x /= 127.5
        x -= 1.
        return x

    if mode == 'torch':
        x /= 255.
        mean = [0.485, 0.456, 0.406]

            else:
                x = x[:, ::-1, ...]
        else:

            x = x[..., ::-1]

            x[2, :, :] -= mean[2]
            if std is not None:
                x[0, :, :] /= std[0]
                x[1, :, :] /= std[1]

    return x
```

With this correction, the function now converts the input array `x` to float32 type before performing any arithmetic operations, ensuring that there are no type mismatch errors. The corrected function should now pass the failing test.
