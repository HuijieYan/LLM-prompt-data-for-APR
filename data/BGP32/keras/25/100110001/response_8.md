### Analysis:
1. The error occurs in the function `_preprocess_numpy_input` at line 82, where the subtraction operation is causing a type error as it is trying to subtract a float value from an int32 array.
2. The error happens when the mode is neither 'tf' nor 'torch', and the data format is 'channels_last'.
3. The cause of the bug is that the mean pixel subtraction is directly performed on the input array 'x' without converting it to float type. This causes a type conflict when subtracting a float value from an array of type int32.
4. To fix the bug, we need to convert the 'x' array to a floating-point type before performing the mean subtraction operation on it.
5. Below is the corrected version of the `_preprocess_numpy_input` function:

### Corrected Function:
```python
import numpy as np

def _preprocess_numpy_input(x, data_format, mode):
    """Preprocesses a Numpy array encoding a batch of images.

    # Arguments
        x: Input array, 3D or 4D.
        data_format: Data format of the image array.
        mode: One of "caffe", "tf" or "torch".
            - caffe: will convert the images from RGB to BGR,
                then will zero-center each color channel with
                respect to the ImageNet dataset,
                without scaling.
            - tf: will scale pixels between -1 and 1,
                sample-wise.
            - torch: will scale pixels between 0 and 1 and then
                will normalize each channel with respect to the
                ImageNet dataset.

By converting the input array 'x' to float32 type before performing operations on it, we ensure compatibility with both float and integer types in the processing steps. This corrected version should prevent the type error encountered in the failing test.
