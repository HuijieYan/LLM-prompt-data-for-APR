### Analysis:
1. The error message indicates that there is a casting issue when trying to subtract a float value from an array element of type int32.
2. The failing test is trying to preprocess an input with int32 values which causes the bug in the `_preprocess_numpy_input` function.
3. The bug is triggered when trying to subtract a mean value from an array element of dtype int32 which is not compatible.
4. To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the data type of the input array `x` is always float to handle the arithmetic operations correctly.

### Fix:
```python
import numpy as np

def _preprocess_numpy_input(x, data_format, mode):
    """Preprocesses a Numpy array encoding a batch of images.

    # Arguments
        x: Input array, 3D or 4D.
        data_format: Data format of the image array.
        mode: One of "caffe", "tf" or "torch".
            - caffe: will convert the images from RGB to BGR,
                then will zero-center each color channel with
                respect to the ImageNet dataset,
                without scaling.
            - tf: will scale pixels between -1 and 1,
                sample-wise.
            - torch: will scale pixels between 0 and 1 and then
                will normalize each channel with respect to the
                ImageNet dataset.

    # Returns
        Preprocessed Numpy array.
    """
    x = x.astype('float32')  # Convert input array to float
    if mode == 'tf':
        x /= 127.5
        x -= 1.
        return x

    if mode == 'torch':
        x /= 255.
        mean = [0.485, 0.456, 0.406]
        std = [0.229, 0.224, 0.225]

                x[0, :, :] /= std[0]
                x[1, :, :] /= std[1]

    else:
        x[..., 0] -= mean[0]

    return x
```

By converting the input array `x` to float32 at the beginning of the `_preprocess_numpy_input` function, the bug related to the casting error is solved. Now, the corrected version of the function should work properly and pass the failing tests.
