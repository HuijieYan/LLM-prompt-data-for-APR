### Analysis:
1. The failing test `test_preprocess_input` is trying to preprocess input images using the `utils.preprocess_input` function.
2. The failing test specifically fails when trying to preprocess the input array with dtype 'int32'.
3. The error message indicates a `UFuncTypeError` related to subtracting a float value from an int32 array.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is caused by trying to subtract a float value from an array with dtype 'int32' in the `_preprocess_numpy_input` function, leading to a type error when trying to assign the result back to the original input array.

### Bug Fix:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the input array has the correct data type before performing the subtraction operation and ensure the resulting array has the same data type as the input array.

### Corrected Function:
```python
def _preprocess_numpy_input(x, data_format, mode):
    """Preprocesses a Numpy array encoding a batch of images.

    # Arguments
        x: Input array, 3D or 4D.
        data_format: Data format of the image array.
        mode: One of "caffe", "tf" or "torch".
            - caffe: will convert the images from RGB to BGR,
                then will zero-center each color channel with
                respect to the ImageNet dataset,
                without scaling.
            - tf: will scale pixels between -1 and 1,
                sample-wise.
            - torch: will scale pixels between 0 and 1 and then
                will normalize each channel with respect to the
                ImageNet dataset.

    # Returns
        Preprocessed Numpy array.

By ensuring proper data type conversion and handling, the corrected version of the `_preprocess_numpy_input` function should address the bug and successfully preprocess the input images without causing type errors.
