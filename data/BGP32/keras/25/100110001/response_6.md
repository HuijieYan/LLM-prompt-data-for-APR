### Analysis:
1. The error occurs when trying to subtract mean values from the input array `x` with dtype 'int32' causing a type error.
2. The error is located at line `x[..., 0] -= mean[0]` inside the `_preprocess_numpy_input` function.
3. The cause of the bug is attempting to perform arithmetic operations on elements of `x` with different data types.
4. The strategy for fixing the bug is to ensure that the input array `x` is converted to a float type before performing the arithmetic operations.


### Corrected Version:
```python
import numpy as np

def _preprocess_numpy_input(x, data_format, mode):
    """Preprocesses a Numpy array encoding a batch of images.

    # Arguments
        x: Input array, 3D or 4D.
        data_format: Data format of the image array.
        mode: One of "caffe", "tf" or "torch".
            - caffe: will convert the images from RGB to BGR,
                then will zero-center each color channel with
                respect to the ImageNet dataset,
                without scaling.
            - tf: will scale pixels between -1 and 1,
                sample-wise.
            - torch: will scale pixels between 0 and 1 and then
                will normalize each channel with respect to the
                ImageNet dataset.

By converting the input array `x` to a float type at the beginning of the `_preprocess_numpy_input` function, the corrected version of the function ensures that all subsequent arithmetic operations can be performed without causing type errors.
