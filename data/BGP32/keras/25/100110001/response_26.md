### Analysis:
1. The failing test `test_preprocess_input` is testing the `preprocess_input` function from `utils.preprocess_input` which internally calls the `_preprocess_numpy_input` function from `applications/imagenet_utils.py`.
2. The failing assert statement is comparing the shape of the output of `utils.preprocess_input(xint)` with the input `xint.shape`.
3. The error message indicates a `UFuncTypeError` during a subtraction operation where the output of the operation is being cast from `float64` to `int32`.

### Bug:
The bug occurs because the input `xint` is being converted to a float value by the operation inside the `_preprocess_numpy_input` function, causing a type mismatch during subtraction.

### Fix:
To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the operations inside the `_preprocess_numpy_input` function consider the type of input appropriately.

### Corrected Version:
```python
import numpy as np

def _preprocess_numpy_input(x, data_format, mode):
    if mode == 'tf':
        x = x.astype('float32')  # Convert to float for further operations
        x /= 127.5
        x -= 1.
        return x

    if mode == 'torch':
        x = x.astype('float32')  # Convert to float for further operations
        x /= 255.
        mean = [0.485, 0.456, 0.406]
        std = [0.229, 0.224, 0.225]
    else:
        if data_format == 'channels_first':
            if x.ndim == 3:
                x = x[::-1, ...]
            else:
                x = x[:, ::-1, ...]
        else:
            x = x[..., ::-1]
        mean = [103.939, 116.779, 123.68]
        std = None

    if x.dtype != 'float32':
        x = x.astype('float32')  # Convert to float for further operations

    if data_format == 'channels_first':
        if x.ndim == 3:
            x[0, :, :] -= mean[0]
            x[1, :, :] -= mean[1]
            x[2, :, :] -= mean[2]
            if std is not None:
                x[0, :, :] /= std[0]
                x[1, :, :] /= std[1]
                x[2, :, :] /= std[2]
        else:
            x[:, 0, :, :] -= mean[0]
            x[:, 1, :, :] -= mean[1]
            x[:, 2, :, :] -= mean[2]
            if std is not None:
                x[:, 0, :, :] /= std[0]
                x[:, 1, :, :] /= std[1]
                x[:, 2, :, :] /= std[2]
    else:
        x[..., 0] -= mean[0]
        x[..., 1] -= mean[1]
        x[..., 2] -= mean[2]
        if std is not None:
            x[..., 0] /= std[0]
            x[..., 1] /= std[1]
            x[..., 2] /= std[2]
    return x
``` 

After implementing these changes, the corrected version of the `_preprocess_numpy_input` function should now handle the data types correctly, preventing the type mismatch error encountered before.
