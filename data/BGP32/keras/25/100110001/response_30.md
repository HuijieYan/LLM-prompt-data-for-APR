### Analysis:
1. The function `_preprocess_numpy_input` preprocesses a Numpy array of images based on the `mode` and `data_format` specified.
2. The failing test case is trying to preprocess an array of images with integer values, leading to a type error when subtracting a float value from an integer value.
3. The error message indicates a `UFuncTypeError` where it is unable to cast the output of the subtraction operation from `float64` to `int32`.

### Bug:
The bug is caused by the attempt to subtract a float value from an integer value in the case where the input `x` array is an integer array. The function does not handle this situation, leading to the error.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the preprocessing steps are consistent with the data type of the input array. If the input array is of integer type, we should perform the calculations in a way that does not lead to type conversion errors.

### Corrected Function:
```python
def _preprocess_numpy_input(x, data_format, mode):
    """Preprocesses a Numpy array encoding a batch of images.

    # Arguments
        x: Input array, 3D or 4D.
        data_format: Data format of the image array.
        mode: One of "caffe", "tf" or "torch".
            - caffe: will convert the images from RGB to BGR,
                then will zero-center each color channel with
                respect to the ImageNet dataset,
                without scaling.
            - tf: will scale pixels between -1 and 1,
                sample-wise.
            - torch: will scale pixels between 0 and 1 and then
                will normalize each channel with respect to the
                ImageNet dataset.

    # Returns
        Preprocessed Numpy array.
    """
    if mode == 'tf':
        x = x.astype('float32')
        x /= 127.5
        x -= 1.
    elif mode == 'torch':
        x = x.astype('float32')
        x /= 255.
        mean = np.array([0.485, 0.456, 0.406])
        std = np.array([0.229, 0.224, 0.225])
    else:
        x = x.astype('float32')
        if data_format == 'channels_first':
            # 'RGB'->'BGR'
            if x.ndim == 3:
                x = x[:, ::-1, ...]
            else:
                x = x[:, :, ::-1, ...]
        else:
            # 'RGB'->'BGR'
            x = x[..., ::-1]
        mean = np.array([103.939, 116.779, 123.68])
        std = None

    # Zero-center by mean pixel
    if data_format == 'channels_first':
        x -= mean.reshape((1, -1, 1, 1))
        if std is not None:
            x /= std.reshape((1, -1, 1, 1))
    else:
        x -= mean
        if std is not None:
            x /= std

    return x
```

In the corrected function, we ensure that the `x` input array is converted to `float32` before performing any mathematical operations. We also use `np.array` for `mean` and `std` to ensure array operations are performed correctly. Additionally, we handle reshaping the mean and std arrays appropriately based on the input data format.

This corrected function should now handle both float and integer input arrays without causing type conversion errors.
