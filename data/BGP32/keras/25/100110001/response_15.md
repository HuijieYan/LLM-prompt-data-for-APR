### Analysis:
1. The failing test is checking the output shape of the `utils.preprocess_input` function when passed with an input array of type `int32`.
2. The error message indicates a `UFuncTypeError` related to casting issue while performing subtraction operation on `int32` array with `float64` values.

### Bug:
The bug occurs when the input array `x` is of type `int32` and the operation to subtract `mean` values, which are all in `float` format, results in a `UFuncTypeError` due to inability to cast `float64` to `int32`.

### Fix:
To fix this issue, we need to ensure all operations that involve casting between integer and float types are handled properly. One way to solve this would be to convert the `int32` input array `x` to `float` before performing the subtraction operation with mean values.

### Corrected Function:
```python
def _preprocess_numpy_input(x, data_format, mode):
    """Preprocesses a Numpy array encoding a batch of images.

    # Arguments
        x: Input array, 3D or 4D.
        data_format: Data format of the image array.
        mode: One of "caffe", "tf" or "torch".
            - caffe: will convert the images from RGB to BGR,
                then will zero-center each color channel with
                respect to the ImageNet dataset,
                without scaling.
            - tf: will scale pixels between -1 and 1,
                sample-wise.
            - torch: will scale pixels between 0 and 1 and then
                will normalize each channel with respect to the
                ImageNet dataset.

    # Returns
        Preprocessed Numpy array.
    """
    x = x.astype('float')  # Convert input array to float

    if mode == 'tf':
        x /= 127.5
        x -= 1.
        return x

    if mode == 'torch':
        x /= 255.
        mean = [0.485, 0.456, 0.406]
        std = [0.229, 0.224, 0.225]
    else:
        if data_format == 'channels_first':
            # 'RGB'->'BGR'
            if x.ndim == 3:
                x = x[::-1, ...]
            else:
                x = x[:, ::-1, ...]
        else:
            # 'RGB'->'BGR'
            x = x[..., ::-1]
        mean = [103.939, 116.779, 123.68]
        std = None

    # Rest of the preprocessing steps remain the same
    ...
```

By converting the input array `x` to float at the beginning of the function, we ensure that all subsequent operations involving float values will not cause casting issues with integer arrays. This correction should resolve the `UFuncTypeError` and the function should now work correctly with input arrays of type `int32`.
