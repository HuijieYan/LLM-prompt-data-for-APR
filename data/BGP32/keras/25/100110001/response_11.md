### Analysis:
1. The failing test is testing the `preprocess_input` function of the `utils` module.
2. The error message is indicating a `UFuncTypeError` when trying to subtract values in the array which suggests there are data type mismatches.
3. The failing test is trying to preprocess an array of integers and the function `_preprocess_numpy_input` contains operations where floating point values are expected.
4. The bug seems to be related to the data type conversion when subtracting mean values from the numpy array.

### Bug:
The bug is caused by attempting to subtract floating point values (mean) from an array filled with integer values, leading to the `UFuncTypeError`.

### Fix:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the input array is converted to a floating point array before performing operations that involve floating point calculations.

### Corrected Version:
```python
import numpy as np

def _preprocess_numpy_input(x, data_format, mode):
    if mode == 'tf':
        x = np.asarray(x, dtype=np.float32)  # Convert to float array
        x /= 127.5
        x -= 1.
        return x

    if mode == 'torch':
        x = np.asarray(x, dtype=np.float32)  # Convert to float array
        x /= 255.
        mean = [0.485, 0.456, 0.406]
        std = [0.229, 0.224, 0.225]
    else:
        if data_format == 'channels_first':
            if x.ndim == 3:
                x = x[::-1, ...]
            else:
                x = x[:, ::-1, ...]
        else:
            x = x[..., ::-1]
        mean = [103.939, 116.779, 123.68]
        std = None

    if not isinstance(x, np.float32):
        x = np.asarray(x, dtype=np.float32)  # Ensure it's a float array before computations

    if data_format == 'channels_first':
        if x.ndim == 3:
            x[0, :, :] -= mean[0]
            x[1, :, :] -= mean[1]
            x[2, :, :] -= mean[2]
            if std is not None:
                x[0, :, :] /= std[0]
                x[1, :, :] /= std[1]
                x[2, :, :] /= std[2]
        else:
            x[:, 0, :, :] -= mean[0]
            x[:, 1, :, :] -= mean[1]
            x[:, 2, :, :] -= mean[2]
            if std is not None:
                x[:, 0, :, :] /= std[0]
                x[:, 1, :, :] /= std[1]
                x[:, 2, :, :] /= std[2]
    else:
        x[..., 0] -= mean[0]
        x[..., 1] -= mean[1]
        x[..., 2] -= mean[2]
        if std is not None:
            x[..., 0] /= std[0]
            x[..., 1] /= std[1]
            x[..., 2] /= std[2]

    return x
```

By ensuring that the input array is converted to a float array before performing operations, we address the data type mismatch issue and the corrected function should now pass the failing test.
