### Analysis:
The buggy function `_preprocess_numpy_input` preprocesses a Numpy array encoding a batch of images based on the specified mode. The bug is likely related to the calculations done for preprocessing based on the provided mode. The function is not correctly handling the RGB to BGR conversion and zero-centering based on the ImageNet dataset.

### Bug Cause:
The bug causes incorrect preprocessing of the input Numpy array when the mode is not 'tf' or 'torch'. Specifically, the calculation for mean subtraction and possibly scale normalization is incorrect when the specified mode is not 'tf' or 'torch'. This leads to incorrect results for the output Numpy array.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to adjust the preprocessing steps based on the provided mode. Specifically, for 'caffe' mode, we need to correctly convert RGB to BGR and apply zero-centering based on the ImageNet dataset.

### Corrected Function:
```python
def _preprocess_numpy_input(x, data_format, mode):
    if mode == 'tf':
        x /= 127.5
        x -= 1.
        return x

    if mode == 'torch':
        x /= 255.
        mean = [0.485, 0.456, 0.406]
        std = [0.229, 0.224, 0.225]
    else:
        if data_format == 'channels_first':
            # 'RGB'->'BGR'
            if x.ndim == 4:
                x = x[:, ::-1, ...]
            else:
                x = x[..., ::-1]
        else:
            # 'RGB'->'BGR'
            x = x[..., ::-1]
        mean = [103.939, 116.779, 123.68]
        std = None

    # Zero-center by mean pixel
    x -= mean

    if std is not None:
        x /= std

    return x
```

The corrected function ensures that the RGB to BGR conversion and zero-centering are correctly applied based on the provided mode. The function now handles the preprocessing steps accurately, leading to correct outputs based on the expected input and output values for different modes and data formats.
