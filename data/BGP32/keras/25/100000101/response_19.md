### Analysis:
The buggy function `_preprocess_numpy_input` is designed to preprocess a Numpy array of images based on the specified mode and data format. The bug appears to be in the calculation of the preprocessing values for the different modes, especially when `mode` is not 'tf' or 'torch'. The mean values used for zero-centering the input data are not correctly applied in these cases, causing incorrect output.

### Bug Explanation:
The bug occurs when `mode` is not 'tf' or 'torch' and the `data_format` is not 'channel_first'. In this case, the function incorrectly calculates the mean values for zero-centering the input data, which leads to an incorrect preprocessing result.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the mean values used for zero-centering are properly calculated based on the specified mode and data format. We also need to ensure that the scaling and normalization operations are appropriately handled for each mode.

### Corrected Function:
```python
def _preprocess_numpy_input(x, data_format, mode):
    if mode == 'tf':
        x /= 127.5
        x -= 1.
        return x

    if mode == 'torch':
        x /= 255.
        mean = [0.485, 0.456, 0.406]
        std = [0.229, 0.224, 0.225]
        x = (x - mean) / std
    else:
        if data_format == 'channels_first':
            if x.ndim == 3:
                x[:, 0, :, :] -= 103.939
                x[:, 1, :, :] -= 116.779
                x[:, 2, :, :] -= 123.68
            else:
                x[:, :, 0, :] -= 103.939
                x[:, :, 1, :] -= 116.779
                x[:, :, 2, :] -= 123.68
        else:
            x[..., 0] -= 103.939
            x[..., 1] -= 116.779
            x[..., 2] -= 123.68
    return x
```

This corrected version of the function fixes the bug by correctly implementing the mean values for zero-centering based on the specified mode and data format. It also ensures proper scaling and normalization operations for each mode. Now, the function should produce the expected output for all the test cases provided.
