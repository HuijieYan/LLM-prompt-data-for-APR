The bug in the `_preprocess_numpy_input` function is that the mean subtraction and normalization are not correctly applied based on the data format and mode.

The bug causes incorrect preprocessing and transformation of the input array, leading to unexpected outcomes compared to the expected values in each case.

To fix the bug, we need to adjust the mean subtraction and normalization operations based on the data format and mode specified in the function.

Here is the corrected version of the `_preprocess_numpy_input` function:

```python
def _preprocess_numpy_input(x, data_format, mode):
    if mode == 'tf':
        x /= 127.5
        x -= 1.
        return x

    if mode == 'torch':
        x /= 255.
        mean = [0.485, 0.456, 0.406]
        std = [0.229, 0.224, 0.225]
    else:
        if data_format == 'channels_first':
            if x.ndim == 4:
                x[:, 0] -= 103.939
                x[:, 1] -= 116.779
                x[:, 2] -= 123.68
            else:
                x[0] -= 103.939
                x[1] -= 116.779
                x[2] -= 123.68
        else:
            x[..., 0] -= 103.939
            x[..., 1] -= 116.779
            x[..., 2] -= 123.68

    if mode == 'torch':
        if std is not None:
            x[..., 0] /= std[0]
            x[..., 1] /= std[1]
            x[..., 2] /= std[2]

    return x
```

This corrected version ensures that mean subtraction and normalization are correctly applied based on the data format and mode specified, thus addressing the bug present in the original function.
