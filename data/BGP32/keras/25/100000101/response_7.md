### Analysis:
The buggy function `_preprocess_numpy_input` is supposed to preprocess a Numpy array of images based on the specified `mode` and `data_format`. The function appears to have a bug in handling the normalization and channel conversion logic, specifically when `mode` is not 'tf' or 'torch'.

### Bug explanation:
1. When `mode` is not 'tf' or 'torch', the function attempts to convert from RGB to BGR format and normalize the channels based on predefined mean values. The bug occurs when the `data_format` is 'channels_first' as the code doesn't handle this data format appropriately.

### Bug fix:
1. Update the channel normalization and conversion logic to correctly handle the 'channels_first' data format.
2. Ensure that the mean values are applied correctly to each channel for normalization.

### Corrected Function:
```python
def _preprocess_numpy_input(x, data_format, mode):
    """Preprocesses a Numpy array encoding a batch of images.

    # Arguments
        x: Input array, 3D or 4D.
        data_format: Data format of the image array.
        mode: One of "caffe", "tf" or "torch".
            - caffe: will convert the images from RGB to BGR,
                then will zero-center each color channel with
                respect to the ImageNet dataset,
                without scaling.
            - tf: will scale pixels between -1 and 1,
                sample-wise.
            - torch: will scale pixels between 0 and 1 and then
                will normalize each channel with respect to the
                ImageNet dataset.

    # Returns
        Preprocessed Numpy array.
    """
    if mode == 'tf':
        x /= 127.5
        x -= 1.
        return x

    if mode == 'torch':
        x /= 255.
        mean = [0.485, 0.456, 0.406]
        std = [0.229, 0.224, 0.225]
    else:
        if data_format == 'channels_first':
            # 'RGB'->'BGR' and normalize each channel
            mean = [103.939, 116.779, 123.68]
            std = None
            x[:, 0, :, :] -= mean[0]
            x[:, 1, :, :] -= mean[1]
            x[:, 2, :, :] -= mean[2]
            if std is not None:
                x[:, 0, :, :] /= std[0]
                x[:, 1, :, :] /= std[1]
                x[:, 2, :, :] /= std[2]
        else:
            # 'RGB'->'BGR' and normalize each channel
            mean = [103.939, 116.779, 123.68]
            std = None
            x[..., 0] -= mean[0]
            x[..., 1] -= mean[1]
            x[..., 2] -= mean[2]
            if std is not None:
                x[..., 0] /= std[0]
                x[..., 1] /= std[1]
                x[..., 2] /= std[2]
    return x
``` 

This corrected function should now properly handle the preprocessing of input images in both 'channels_first' and 'channels_last' data formats according to the specified mode.
