### Analysis:
The buggy function `_preprocess_numpy_input` is intended to preprocess a batch of images based on the mode specified. However, there are several issues within the function that need to be addressed:
1. In the 'tf' mode, the function divides by 127.5 and then subtracts 1, but it should divide by 127.5 first and then subtract 1.
2. In the 'torch' mode, the mean and std values are defined only for this mode, but they should also be used for the 'caffe' mode.
3. The mean and std values are applied incorrectly based on the data format and number of dimensions of the input array in both 'torch' and 'caffe' modes.
4. In some cases, the modification of the input array 'x' is not done correctly.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bugs in the `_preprocess_numpy_input` function, the following modifications should be made:
1. Correct the order of operations in the 'tf' mode.
2. Use the mean and std values for both 'tf' and 'torch' modes, and adjust the application based on the data format and number of dimensions.
3. Ensure correct indexing and operations on the input array 'x' for each case.

### Corrected Function:
```python
def _preprocess_numpy_input(x, data_format, mode):
    """Preprocesses a Numpy array encoding a batch of images.

    # Arguments
        x: Input array, 3D or 4D.
        data_format: Data format of the image array ('channels_first' or 'channels_last').
        mode: One of 'caffe', 'tf', or 'torch'.
            - caffe: will convert the images from RGB to BGR,
                then will zero-center each color channel with
                respect to the ImageNet dataset,
                without scaling.
            - tf: will scale pixels between -1 and 1, sample-wise.
            - torch: will scale pixels between 0 and 1 and then
                will normalize each channel with respect to the
                ImageNet dataset.

    # Returns
        Preprocessed Numpy array.
