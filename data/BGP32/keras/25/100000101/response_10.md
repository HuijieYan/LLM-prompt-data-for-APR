#### Analysis:
The buggy function `_preprocess_numpy_input` preprocesses a numpy array of images based on the given mode and data format. The bug arises in the calculation of the preprocessed values for each mode.

- For mode 'tf', the bug lies in the incorrect scaling by dividing `x` by 127.5 rather than multiplying.
- For mode 'torch', the mean and std are incorrectly calculated, where the mean is subtracted and the std is divided, leading to incorrect normalization.

#### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
1. Correct the scaling operation for mode 'tf' by multiplying `x` by 127.5 instead of dividing.
2. Fix the mean and std calculation for mode 'torch' by only subtracting the mean from `x` and dividing by std if std is not None.

#### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def _preprocess_numpy_input(x, data_format, mode):
    """Preprocesses a Numpy array encoding a batch of images.

    # Arguments
        x: Input array, 3D or 4D.
        data_format: Data format of the image array.
        mode: One of "caffe", "tf" or "torch".
            - caffe: will convert the images from RGB to BGR,
                then will zero-center each color channel with
                respect to the ImageNet dataset,
                without scaling.
            - tf: will scale pixels between -1 and 1,
                sample-wise.
            - torch: will scale pixels between 0 and 1 and then
                will normalize each channel with respect to the
                ImageNet dataset.

This corrected version of the function should now correctly preprocess the input numpy arrays according to the specified mode and data format while satisfying all the expected cases.
