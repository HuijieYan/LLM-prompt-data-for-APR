The bug in this function lies in the calculation of mean and standard deviation values according to the given `mode`, and handling the `data_format`.

### Bug Explanation:
1. When `mode` is 'caffe', the function should perform RGB to BGR conversion and zero-centering based on the ImageNet dataset mean values without scaling.
2. The bug occurs when the `mode` is 'caffe' and the `data_format` is 'channels_first'. In this case, the function should reverse the channels (from 'RGB' to 'BGR') for a 3D array, but the code only handles the case of a 4D array. This leads to incorrect channel positioning in the output.

### Strategy for fixing the bug:
1. We need to correctly handle the case when the `mode` is 'caffe' and `data_format` is 'channels_first' for both 3D and 4D arrays.
2. Perform the RGB to BGR conversion and zero-centering as required for the given mode.

### Corrected Version of the function:
```python
def _preprocess_numpy_input(x, data_format, mode):
    """Preprocesses a Numpy array encoding a batch of images.

    # Arguments
        x: Input array, 3D or 4D.
        data_format: Data format of the image array.
        mode: One of "caffe", "tf" or "torch".
            - caffe: will convert the images from RGB to BGR,
                then will zero-center each color channel with
                respect to the ImageNet dataset,
                without scaling.
            - tf: will scale pixels between -1 and 1,
                sample-wise.
            - torch: will scale pixels between 0 and 1 and then
                will normalize each channel with respect to the
                ImageNet dataset.

    # Returns
        Preprocessed Numpy array.
    """
    if mode == 'tf':
        x /= 127.5
        x -= 1.
        return x

    if mode == 'torch':
        x /= 255.
        mean = [0.485, 0.456, 0.406]
        std = [0.229, 0.224, 0.225]
    else:
        if data_format == 'channels_first':
            # 'RGB'->'BGR' for 3D array
            x = x[:, ::-1, ...]
        else:
            # 'RGB'->'BGR' for both 3D and 4D arrays
            x = x[..., ::-1]
        mean = [103.939, 116.779, 123.68]
        std = None

    # Zero-center by mean pixel
    x -= mean[None, :, None, None] # broadcasting to all elements
    if std is not None:
        x /= std[None, :, None, None] # broadcasting to all elements
    return x
```

Now, the corrected function properly handles the RGB to BGR conversion and zero-centering operations for both 3D and 4D arrays with the appropriate `data_format`.
