The bug in the `_preprocess_numpy_input` function lies within the implementation of the 'torch' mode. The bug causes incorrect operations on the input array when 'torch' mode is selected, resulting in incorrect preprocessed values.

To fix the bug, we need to correctly implement the operations for the 'torch' mode to scale pixels between 0 and 1 and then normalize each channel with respect to the ImageNet dataset. Specifically, we need to ensure that the mean and standard deviation are correctly applied to each channel of the input array.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _preprocess_numpy_input(x, data_format, mode):
    if mode == 'tf':
        x /= 127.5
        x -= 1.
        return x

    if mode == 'torch':
        x /= 255.
        mean = [0.485, 0.456, 0.406]  # Mean for normalization
        std = [0.229, 0.224, 0.225]  # Standard deviation for normalization
        x = (x - mean) / std
    else:
        if data_format == 'channels_first':
            if x.ndim == 3:
                x = x[::-1, ...]
            else:
                x = x[:, ::-1, ...]
        else:
            x = x[..., ::-1]
        mean = [103.939, 116.779, 123.68]
        std = None

    if data_format == 'channels_first':
        if x.ndim == 3:
            x[0, :, :] -= mean[0]
            x[1, :, :] -= mean[1]
            x[2, :, :] -= mean[2]
            if std is not None:
                x[0, :, :] /= std[0]
                x[1, :, :] /= std[1]
                x[2, :, :] /= std[2]
        else:
            x[:, 0, :, :] -= mean[0]
            x[:, 1, :, :] -= mean[1]
            x[:, 2, :, :] -= mean[2]
            if std is not None:
                x[:, 0, :, :] /= std[0]
                x[:, 1, :, :] /= std[1]
                x[:, 2, :, :] /= std[2]
    else:
        x[..., 0] -= mean[0]
        x[..., 1] -= mean[1]
        x[..., 2] -= mean[2]
        if std is not None:
            x[..., 0] /= std[0]
            x[..., 1] /= std[1]
            x[..., 2] /= std[2]
    return x
```

This corrected version ensures that the 'torch' mode properly scales and normalizes the input array according to the specified mean and standard deviation values.

After applying this correction, the function should now produce the expected output values for all the given test cases.
