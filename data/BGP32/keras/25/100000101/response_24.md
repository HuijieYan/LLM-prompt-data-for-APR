### Analysis
The buggy function `_preprocess_numpy_input` aims to preprocess input Numpy arrays encoding a batch of images based on the `mode` and `data_format` parameters. The function applies different processing steps for different modes (`'tf'` or `'torch'` vs. default). The issue arises when `mode` is not `'tf'` or `'torch'` because the function fails to correctly preprocess the input array.

The expected output values involve adjusting the color channels based on the mean and standard deviation values for different modes and data formats.

### Bug
The bug arises from incorrect processing for modes other than `'tf'` and `'torch'`. The function does not correctly apply the required adjustments for mean and standard deviation when the mode is different.

### Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the function correctly preprocesses the input Numpy array regardless of the mode. We should calculate the correct mean and standard deviation values based on the specified mode and data format, then adjust the color channels accordingly.

### Corrected Function
```python
def _preprocess_numpy_input(x, data_format, mode):
    """Preprocesses a Numpy array encoding a batch of images.

    # Arguments
        x: Input array, 3D or 4D.
        data_format: Data format of the image array.
        mode: One of "caffe", "tf" or "torch".
            - caffe: will convert the images from RGB to BGR,
                then will zero-center each color channel with
                respect to the ImageNet dataset,
                without scaling.
            - tf: will scale pixels between -1 and 1,
                sample-wise.
            - torch: will scale pixels between 0 and 1 and then
                will normalize each channel with respect to the
                ImageNet dataset.

    # Returns
        Preprocessed Numpy array.
    """
    if mode == 'tf':
        x /= 127.5
        x -= 1.
        return x

    if mode == 'torch':
        x /= 255.
        mean = [0.485, 0.456, 0.406]
        std = [0.229, 0.224, 0.225]
    else:
        if data_format == 'channels_first':
            # 'RGB'->'BGR'
            if x.ndim == 3:

            else:
                x = x[:, :, ::-1, ...]

        if x.ndim == 3:
            for i in range(3):
                x[i, :, :] -= mean[i]
                if std is not None:
                    x[i, :, :] /= std[i]
        else:
            for i in range(3):
                x[:, i, :, :] -= mean[i]
                if std is not None:
                    x[:, i, :, :] /= std[i]
    else:
        for i in range(3):
            x[..., i] -= mean[i]
            if std is not None:
                x[..., i] /= std[i]
    
    return x
``` 

The corrected function adapts the mean and standard deviation adjustments for all modes and data formats, ensuring correct preprocessing of the input Numpy array.
