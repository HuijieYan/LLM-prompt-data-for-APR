### Analysis:
The buggy function `_preprocess_numpy_input` is intended to preprocess a numpy array of images based on the given data format and mode. However, there are issues identified in the implementation that result in incorrect outputs.

### Bugs:
1. In the case where `mode` is not 'tf' or 'torch', there are inconsistencies in handling the `data_format` to convert RGB to BGR.
2. The calculations for mean pixel subtraction and normalization are incorrect, leading to incorrect preprocessing.

### Bugs Fix:
1. Ensure that the conversion of RGB to BGR takes place correctly based on the `data_format`.
2. Update the mean pixel subtraction and normalization calculations to align with the correct values.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def _preprocess_numpy_input(x, data_format, mode):
    if mode == 'tf':
        x /= 127.5
        x -= 1.
        return x
    elif mode == 'torch':
        x /= 255.
        mean = [0.485, 0.456, 0.406]
        std = [0.229, 0.224, 0.225]
    else:
        mean = [103.939, 116.779, 123.68]
        std = None
        
        if data_format == 'channels_first':
            # 'RGB'->'BGR'
            if x.ndim == 4:
                x = x[:, ::-1, ...]
            else:
                x = x[..., ::-1]
        else:
            # 'RGB'->'BGR'
            x = x[..., ::-1]

    if std is not None:
        x[..., 0] -= mean[0]
        x[..., 1] -= mean[1]
        x[..., 2] -= mean[2]
        x[..., 0] /= std[0]
        x[..., 1] /= std[1]
        x[..., 2] /= std[2]
    else:
        x[..., 0] -= mean[0]
        x[..., 1] -= mean[1]
        x[..., 2] -= mean[2]

    return x
```

The corrected function addresses the bugs by correctly handling the RGB to BGR conversion and applying the mean pixel subtraction and normalization based on the data format and mode. It should now produce the expected values for the given test cases.
