### Analysis:
1. The function `_preprocess_numpy_input` preprocesses a numpy array encoding images based on the mode and data format provided.
2. The buggy function has issues in calculating and applying the mean and standard deviation values for different modes and data formats.
3. The bug causes incorrect preprocessing, leading to incorrect color channel transformations and normalization.
4. To fix the bug, we need to ensure correct calculations and application of mean and standard deviation for different modes and data formats.

### Bug Fix:
```python
import numpy as np

def _preprocess_numpy_input(x, data_format, mode):
    """Preprocesses a Numpy array encoding a batch of images.

    # Arguments
        x: Input array, 3D or 4D.
        data_format: Data format of the image array.
        mode: One of "caffe", "tf" or "torch".
            - caffe: will convert the images from RGB to BGR,
                then will zero-center each color channel with
                respect to the ImageNet dataset,
                without scaling.
            - tf: will scale pixels between -1 and 1,
                sample-wise.
            - torch: will scale pixels between 0 and 1 and then
                will normalize each channel with respect to the
                ImageNet dataset.

    # Returns
        Preprocessed Numpy array.

        if std is not None:
            x[:, 0, :, :] /= std[0]
            x[:, 1, :, :] /= std[1]
            x[:, 2, :, :] /= std[2]
    else:
        x[..., 0] -= mean[0]

``` 

By correcting the mean calculations and applying transformations based on correct dimensions and formats, the corrected function should now properly preprocess the input images as per the expected values given in the test cases.
