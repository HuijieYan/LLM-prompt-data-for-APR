### Explanation:
The bug in the `_preprocess_numpy_input` function arises from the logic related to the adjustment of input array `x` based on the `data_format` and `mode` parameters. The bug is primarily present in the calculation of mean and standard deviation values and their application to the input array `x`. These calculations are not correctly aligned with the expected preprocessing based on the specified `mode`.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Ensure that the mean and standard deviation arrays are correctly used for different modes.
2. Adjust the color channel manipulation to cater to the specified `data_format`.
3. Modify the normalization procedures based on the `mode` parameter value.
4. Reorganize the zero-centering and normalization steps to align with the expected preprocessing behavior for each mode.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def _preprocess_numpy_input(x, data_format, mode):
    if mode == 'tf':
        x /= 127.5
        x -= 1.
        return x

    if mode == 'torch':
        x /= 255.
        mean = [0.485, 0.456, 0.406]
        std = [0.229, 0.224, 0.225]
    else:
        if data_format == 'channels_first':
            if x.ndim == 4:
                x[:, 0, :, :] -= 103.939
                x[:, 1, :, :] -= 116.779
                x[:, 2, :, :] -= 123.68
            else:
                x[0, :, :, :] -= 103.939
                x[1, :, :, :] -= 116.779
                x[2, :, :, :] -= 123.68
        else:
            x[..., 0] -= 103.939
            x[..., 1] -= 116.779
            x[..., 2] -= 123.68

    if mode == 'torch':
        if data_format == 'channels_first':
            x[0, :, :] /= 0.229
            x[1, :, :] /= 0.224
            x[2, :, :] /= 0.225
        else:
            x[..., 0] /= 0.229
            x[..., 1] /= 0.224
            x[..., 2] /= 0.225

    return x
```

The corrected function ensures that the preprocessing steps are applied correctly based on the given `mode` and `data_format`. The mean and standard deviation values are utilized as per the requirements of each mode, and the adjustments are made accordingly to achieve the expected output values for each case.
