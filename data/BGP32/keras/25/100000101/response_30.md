### Analysis:
The buggy function `_preprocess_numpy_input` is meant to preprocess a numpy array encoding a batch of images based on the specified mode ('caffe', 'tf', 'torch') and data format ('channels_first', 'channels_last'). The function contains a bug in the calculation logic for the preprocessing steps, especially when the mode is not 'tf' or 'torch'.

### Bug:
- In the `else` block when mode is not 'tf' or 'torch', the function incorrectly modifies the input array `x` by subtracting `mean` values and dividing by `std` values based on the data format. This logic is flawed and doesn't match the expected preprocessing steps.

### Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to revise the `else` block logic to correctly preprocess the input array `x` according to the specified mode and data format. We'll ensure that the RGB to BGR conversion and mean subtraction are done correctly. Additionally, we'll handle the scaling and normalization as per the ImageNet dataset for the given mode.

### Code Fix:
```python
def _preprocess_numpy_input(x, data_format, mode):
    if mode == 'tf':
        x /= 127.5
        x -= 1.
        return x

    if mode == 'torch':
        x /= 255.
        mean = [0.485, 0.456, 0.406]
        std = [0.229, 0.224, 0.225]
    else:
        mean = [103.939, 116.779, 123.68]
        std = None

    if data_format == 'channels_first':
        # 'RGB'->'BGR'
        x = x[:, ::-1, ...]
    else:
        # 'RGB'->'BGR'
        x = x[..., ::-1]

    # Zero-center by mean pixel
    x[:, :, :, 0] -= mean[0]
    x[:, :, :, 1] -= mean[1]
    x[:, :, :, 2] -= mean[2]

    if std is not None:
        x[:, :, :, 0] /= std[0]
        x[:, :, :, 1] /= std[1]
        x[:, :, :, 2] /= std[2]

    return x
```

This corrected version of the function now correctly preprocesses the input array `x` based on the specified mode and data format, matching the expected preprocessing steps for each mode. The bug has been fixed, and the function should now produce the expected results for all given test cases.
