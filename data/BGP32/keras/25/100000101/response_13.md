The bug in the `_preprocess_numpy_input` function lies in the calculation of mean and std when the mode is neither 'tf' nor 'torch'. The mean and std values are not correctly assigned according to the data format. Additionally, the function does not handle the conversion from RGB to BGR correctly for channels_last data format.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the proper mean and std values are set based on the data format. Also, we need to correctly convert RGB to BGR when the data format is channels_last.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _preprocess_numpy_input(x, data_format, mode):
    """Preprocesses a Numpy array encoding a batch of images.

    # Arguments
        x: Input array, 3D or 4D.
        data_format: Data format of the image array.
        mode: One of "caffe", "tf" or "torch".
            - caffe: will convert the images from RGB to BGR,
                then will zero-center each color channel with
                respect to the ImageNet dataset,
                without scaling.
            - tf: will scale pixels between -1 and 1,
                sample-wise.
            - torch: will scale pixels between 0 and 1 and then
                will normalize each channel with respect to the
                ImageNet dataset.

    # Returns
        Preprocessed Numpy array.
    """
    if mode == 'tf':
        x /= 127.5
        x -= 1.
        return x

    if mode == 'torch':
        x /= 255.
        mean = [0.485, 0.456, 0.406]
        std = [0.229, 0.224, 0.225]
    else:
        if data_format == 'channels_first':
            x[:, 0] -= 103.939
            x[:, 1] -= 116.779
            x[:, 2] -= 123.68
        else:
            x[..., 0] -= 103.939
            x[..., 1] -= 116.779
            x[..., 2] -= 123.68
            x = x[..., ::-1]  # Convert RGB to BGR

        mean = [103.939, 116.779, 123.68]
        std = None

    if std is not None:
        x[..., 0] /= std[0]
        x[..., 1] /= std[1]
        x[..., 2] /= std[2]

    return x
```

With this correction, the function should now handle the preprocessing of numpy arrays correctly according to the input parameters and expected output values for all test cases provided.
