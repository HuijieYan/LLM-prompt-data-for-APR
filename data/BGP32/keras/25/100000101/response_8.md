### Analysis:
The buggy function `_preprocess_numpy_input` is designed to preprocess a Numpy array of images based on the given mode and data format. The bug seems to be related to incorrect preprocessing steps for the input array based on the chosen mode ('tf', 'torch', or default). The function is not properly handling the conversion of color channels from RGB to BGR and normalizing the pixel values based on the ImageNet dataset.

### Bug:
The bug arises from the incorrect handling of the preprocessing steps based on the input parameters 'mode' and 'data_format'. In particular, the bug occurs when the 'mode' is not 'tf' or 'torch', and there is a mismatch in the data format or the number of dimensions of the input array.

### Fix:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the preprocessing steps are correctly applied based on the defined modes ('tf', 'torch', or default) and the data format ('channels_first' or 'channels_last'). Additionally, we need to handle the conversion of color channels properly when 'mode' is not 'tf' or 'torch'.

### Corrected Version:
```python
import numpy as np

def _preprocess_numpy_input(x, data_format, mode):
    """Preprocesses a Numpy array encoding a batch of images.

    # Arguments
        x: Input array, 3D or 4D.
        data_format: Data format of the image array.
        mode: One of "caffe", "tf" or "torch".
            - caffe: will convert the images from RGB to BGR,
                then will zero-center each color channel with
                respect to the ImageNet dataset,
                without scaling.
            - tf: will scale pixels between -1 and 1,
                sample-wise.
            - torch: will scale pixels between 0 and 1 and then
                will normalize each channel with respect to the
                ImageNet dataset.

    # Returns
        Preprocessed Numpy array.
    """
    
    # Ensure x is converted to float32 to allow division
    x = x.astype(np.float32)
    
    if mode == 'tf':
        x /= 127.5
        x -= 1.
        return x

    if mode == 'torch':
        x /= 255.
        mean = np.array([0.485, 0.456, 0.406])
        std = np.array([0.229, 0.224, 0.225])
    else:
        mean = np.array([103.939, 116.779, 123.68])
        std = None
        # Convert the color channels based on data format
        if data_format == 'channels_first':
            x[:, 0, :, :] -= mean[0]
            x[:, 1, :, :] -= mean[1]
            x[:, 2, :, :] -= mean[2]
            if std is not None:
                x[:, 0, :, :] /= std[0]
                x[:, 1, :, :] /= std[1]
                x[:, 2, :, :] /= std[2]
        else:
            x[..., 0] -= mean[0]
            x[..., 1] -= mean[1]
            x[..., 2] -= mean[2]
            if std is not None:
                x[..., 0] /= std[0]
                x[..., 1] /= std[1]
                x[..., 2] /= std[2]
    
    return x
``` 

By updating the function as shown above, the bug in the `_preprocess_numpy_input` function should be resolved, and the expected input/output values for the provided test cases should be satisfied.
