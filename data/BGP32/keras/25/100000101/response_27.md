### Bug Explanation
The bug in the `_preprocess_numpy_input` function occurs when the `data_format` is not equal to 'tf' or 'torch'. In this case, the function incorrectly processes the input array x by subtracting fixed values (mean) from its color channels without scaling. This leads to incorrect preprocessing for 'caffe' mode and 'channels_last' data format, causing the expected output values to be different from the actual output.

### Bug Fix
To fix the bug, we need to properly preprocess the input array x based on the given mode ('caffe', 'tf', 'torch') and data format ('channels_first', 'channels_last'). We should apply the correct transformation for the 'caffe' mode, which includes converting RGB to BGR, zero-centering each color channel, and optionally normalizing with respect to ImageNet mean and standard deviation.

### Corrected Function
```python
def _preprocess_numpy_input(x, data_format, mode):
    if mode == 'tf':
        x = x / 127.5 - 1.
    elif mode == 'torch':
        x /= 255.
        mean = [0.485, 0.456, 0.406]
        std = [0.229, 0.224, 0.225]
        for i in range(3):
            x[..., i] = (x[..., i] - mean[i]) / std[i]
    else:
        if data_format == 'channels_first':
            x = x[:, ::-1, ...]  # RGB to BGR
        else:
            x = x[..., ::-1]  # RGB to BGR

        mean = [103.939, 116.779, 123.68]
        for i in range(3):
            x[..., i] -= mean[i]

    return x
```

This corrected function properly handles the preprocessing steps for different modes and data formats as described in the comments. The corrected function should now produce the expected output values for all the given test cases.
