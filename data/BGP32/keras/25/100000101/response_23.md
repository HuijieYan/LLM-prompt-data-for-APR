## Analysis:
The buggy function `_preprocess_numpy_input` is designed to preprocess a numpy array encoding a batch of images based on a specified mode and data format. However, there are several issues within the function that prevent it from correctly preprocessing the input.

1. The function does not correctly handle the data format conversions ('channels_first' and 'channels_last').
2. There is an issue with the mean subtraction and standardization calculations, especially for different data formats and modes.

## Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to:
1. Modify the code to correctly handle the data format conversions.
2. Update the mean subtraction and standardization calculations based on the data format and mode.

## Code Correction:
```python
def _preprocess_numpy_input(x, data_format, mode):
    if mode == 'tf':
        x /= 127.5
        x -= 1.
        return x

    if mode == 'torch':
        x /= 255.
        mean = [0.485, 0.456, 0.406]
        std = [0.229, 0.224, 0.225]
    else:
        if data_format == 'channels_last':
            x = x[..., ::-1]
        else:
            x = x[:, ::-1, ...]

        mean = [103.939, 116.779, 123.68]
        std = None

    if std is not None:
        x = (x - mean) / std
    else:
        x -= mean

    return x
```

By making the above corrections, the function should now correctly preprocess the input numpy arrays according to the specified mode and data format, satisfying all the provided test cases.
