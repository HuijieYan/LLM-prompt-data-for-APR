### Analysis:
The buggy function `_preprocess_numpy_input` aims to preprocess an input Numpy array containing image data based on the specified `mode` and `data_format` parameters. The function includes logic to handle different preprocessing requirements for different modes (`caffe`, `tf`, `torch`) and data formats (`channels_first`, `channels_last`).

### Identified Issues:
1. The function is directly modifying the input array `x` in place, which can lead to unexpected behavior.
2. The calculation `x /= 127.5` should be done based on the type of the elements in the array.

### Cause of the Bug:
The bug arises due to in-place modification of the input array `x` combined with the incorrect calculation on the input array.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
1. Avoid in-place modification of the input array by working with a copy of the array.
2. Ensure that all calculations on the array are done based on the correct data type of the elements in the array.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
import numpy as np

def _preprocess_numpy_input(x, data_format, mode):
    x_copy = np.copy(x)
    
    if mode == 'tf':
        x_copy = x_copy / 127.5 - 1
        return x_copy.astype(np.float32)

    if mode == 'torch':
        x_copy = x_copy / 255.0
        mean = [0.485, 0.456, 0.406]
        std = [0.229, 0.224, 0.225]
    else:
        if data_format == 'channels_first':
            # 'RGB' -> 'BGR'
            if x_copy.ndim == 3:
                x_copy = x_copy[:, ::-1, ...]
            else:
                x_copy = x_copy[:, :, ::-1, ...]
        else:
            # 'RGB' -> 'BGR'
            x_copy = x_copy[..., ::-1]
        mean = [103.939, 116.779, 123.68]
        std = None

    # Zero-center by mean pixel
    if data_format == 'channels_first':
        x_copy -= mean
        if std is not None:
            x_copy /= std
    else:
        x_copy -= mean
        if std is not None:
            x_copy /= std

    return x_copy.astype(np.float32)
```

This corrected version creates a copy of the input array (`x_copy`) at the beginning to avoid modifying the original input array. It ensures correct data type handling throughout the preprocessing steps and returns the preprocessed array with the correct data type (`np.float32`).
