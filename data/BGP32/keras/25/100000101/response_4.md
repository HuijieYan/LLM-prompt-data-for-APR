The bug in the `_preprocess_numpy_input` function is related to the calculation and application of mean and standard deviation values during preprocessing. The bug causes incorrect data manipulation and scaling in certain scenarios, resulting in wrong outputs.

The strategy to fix this bug involves adjusting the calculations for mean and standard deviation based on the `mode` and `data_format` values provided.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _preprocess_numpy_input(x, data_format, mode):
    if mode == 'tf':
        x /= 127.5
        x -= 1.
        return x

    if mode == 'torch':
        if data_format == 'channels_first':
            x /= 255.
            mean = [0.485, 0.456, 0.406]
            std = [0.229, 0.224, 0.225]
            
            x -= mean[None, :, None, None]
            x /= std[None, :, None, None]
        else:
            x /= 255.
            mean = [0.485, 0.456, 0.406]
            std = [0.229, 0.224, 0.225]
            
            x -= mean[None, None, None, :]
            x /= std[None, None, None, :]
    else:
        if data_format == 'channels_first':
            # 'RGB'->'BGR'
            if x.ndim == 4:
                x = x[:, ::-1, ...]
            else:
                x = x[::-1, ...]
            mean = [103.939, 116.779, 123.68]
            std = None
        else:
            # 'RGB'->'BGR'
            x = x[..., ::-1]
            mean = [103.939, 116.779, 123.68]
            std = None

        x -= mean[None, None, None, :]
        if std is not None:
            x /= std[None, None, None, :]
    
    return x
```

This corrected version considers the different modes and data formats to properly preprocess the input numpy array based on the provided `mode`, `data_format`, and `x` input.
