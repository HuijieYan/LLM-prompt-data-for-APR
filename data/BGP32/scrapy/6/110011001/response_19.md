### Potential Error Locations
1. In the first condition, the code correctly checks for the format and mode of the image. However, there might be an issue with pasting the image onto the background in the PNG and RGBA case.
2. In the second condition, where it checks if the image mode is not RGB, there doesn't seem to be a specific fix applied.
3. The conversion to JPEG format may not be handling transparency properly, causing issues with images that have an alpha channel.

### Cause of the Bug
The bug seems to be related to how the code handles PNG images with RGBA mode. When a PNG image with RGBA mode is encountered, the code creates a new RGBA background image to paste the original image onto. However, when pasting, it incorrectly uses the entire original image as the mask, causing unexpected behavior.


### Fix Strategy
1. When creating the background image, only paste the actual RGBA image onto it, not the original one.
2. Ensure that the correct fix is applied if the image mode is not RGB.

### Corrected Version of the Function
```python
def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
    if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA':
        background = Image.new('RGBA', image.size, (255, 255, 255, 255))
        background.paste(image, (0, 0), image)
        image = background.convert('RGB')
    elif image.mode != 'RGB':
        image = image.convert('RGB')

    if size:
        image = image.copy()
        image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)

    buf = BytesIO()
    image.save(buf, 'JPEG')
    return image, buf
```

This corrected version ensures that the original PNG image with RGBA mode is correctly pasted onto the background image using the alpha channel as a mask. Additionally, the function now handles the conversion to RGB format appropriately.
