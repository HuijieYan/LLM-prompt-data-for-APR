### Analysis
The buggy function `convert_image` is intended to handle converting images to RGB format and resizing them if necessary. The bug occurs when the input image format is PNG and mode is RGBA. The function converts the image to RGB format but doesn't handle the transparency channel properly. This results in an incorrect color change when the image is saved as JPEG.

### Bug Explanation
When the input image format is PNG and mode is RGBA, the function creates a new RGBA background image and pastes the original image on top of it, mistakenly assuming the transparent areas should be white. This incorrect handling leads to a faulty conversion to RGB format which results in a color difference when saving the image.

### Bug Fix
To fix this bug, we need to correctly handle transparency when converting from RGBA to RGB format. We should use a white background with an alpha channel for transparent areas before converting to RGB format.

### Corrected Version
```python
class ImagesPipeline(FilesPipeline):
    def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
        if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA':
            background = Image.new('RGBA', image.size, (255, 255, 255, 255))
            background.paste(image, image)
            image = background.convert('RGB')
        elif image.mode != 'RGB':
            image = image.convert('RGB')

        if size:
            image = image.copy()
            image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)

        buf = BytesIO()
        image.save(buf, 'JPEG')
        return image, buf
``` 

By handling transparency correctly during the conversion from RGBA to RGB format, the corrected version of the function will now properly maintain the color consistency and pass the failing test cases.
