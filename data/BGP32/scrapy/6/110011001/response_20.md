### Bug Description:
The bug in the `convert_image` function arises from the incorrect handling of images with an RGBA mode when their format is PNG. The function is supposed to check if the image format is PNG and the mode is RGBA, then convert it to RGB before proceeding with thumbnail generation. However, the function fails to handle this conversion correctly, resulting in incorrect behavior when processing images with RGBA mode and PNG format.

### Bug Location:
The bug is located in the conditional block that checks if the image format is PNG and the mode is RGBA. The conversion logic inside this block is incorrect.

### Bug Cause:
The bug occurs due to the incorrect conversion step for PNG images with RGBA mode. The incorrect conversion results in the incorrect color values being preserved, leading to failing tests that expect the correct color values after conversion.

### Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to correctly handle the conversion of PNG images with RGBA mode to RGB mode. The correct approach involves creating a new white background image, pasting the original image on it, and then converting it to RGB. This ensures that the transparency information is preserved correctly in the conversion process.

### Corrected Version:
```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: scrapy/pipelines/images.py

# The declaration of the class containing the corrected function
class ImagesPipeline(FilesPipeline):
    """
    Abstract pipeline that implement the image thumbnail generation logic
    
        
    """




    # The corrected function
    def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
        if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA':
            background = Image.new('RGB', image.size, (255, 255, 255))
            background.paste(image, (0, 0), image)
            image = background.convert('RGB')
        elif image.mode != 'RGB':
            image = image.convert('RGB')
    
        if size:
            image = image.copy()
            image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)
    
        buf = BytesIO()
        image.save(buf, 'JPEG')
        image = Image.open(buf)
        return image, buf
```

By correcting the conversion logic and preserving transparency correctly, the `convert_image` function should now handle PNG images with RGBA mode appropriately and pass the failing tests.
