### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `convert_image` has logic to handle image format and mode, converting images to RGB format and handling thumbnails. The bug seems to be related to the conversion of PNG images with RGBA mode, which should be handled by creating a new RGBA image, pasting the original image onto it, and converting it to RGB.
2. The bug is likely located in the handling of PNG images with RGBA mode, where a new RGBA background image is created with white color but then pasted incorrectly using the existing image.
3. The error occurs when converting PNG images with RGBA mode to RGB, resulting in incorrect colors in the converted image. This causes the test to fail as the expected colors do not match the incorrect conversion.
4. The strategy to fix the bug is to correctly paste the original image onto the new RGBA background image and then convert the result to RGB, ensuring the colors are maintained during the conversion.
5. The corrected version of the function is provided below.


### Corrected Version:
```python
def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
    if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA':
        background = Image.new('RGBA', image.size, (255, 255, 255, 255))
        background.paste(image, (0, 0, image.width, image.height))  # paste the original image onto the background
        image = background.convert('RGB')
    elif image.mode != 'RGB':
        image = image.convert('RGB')

    if size:
        image = image.copy()
        image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)

    buf = BytesIO()
    image.save(buf, 'JPEG')
    return image, buf
``` 

By correcting the paste operation on the RGBA background image and ensuring a proper RGB conversion for PNG images with RGBA mode, the function should now handle the conversion correctly as expected by the tests.
