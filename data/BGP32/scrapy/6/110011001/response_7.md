### Analysis
The bug in the `convert_image` function arises when the input image has the format 'PNG' and mode 'RGBA'. The function attempts to convert the image to RGB format by creating a new image with a white background and pasting the original image on top of it. However, the `paste` method is used incorrectly as it expects a mask argument to handle transparency properly.

### Bug
The bug occurs when trying to convert PNG images with RGBA mode to RGB. The incorrect usage of the `paste` method results in transparency not being handled correctly, leading to incorrect colors in the converted image.

### Fix
To fix the bug, we need to correctly handle transparency when converting PNG images with RGBA mode to RGB mode. This can be done by using the `alpha_composite` method to paste the image onto a background with the correct alpha channel. Then, the image can be converted to RGB as desired.

### Correction

```python
from PIL import Image
from cStringIO import StringIO as BytesIO
from PIL.ImageOps import fit

# The declaration of the class containing the buggy function
class ImagesPipeline(FilesPipeline):
    """
    Abstract pipeline that implement the image thumbnail generation logic
    
        
    """

    # Corrected convert_image function
    def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
        if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA':
            background = Image.new('RGBA', image.size, (255, 255, 255, 255))
            background.paste(image, (0, 0), image)
            image = background.convert('RGB')
        elif image.mode != 'RGB':
            image = image.convert('RGB')
    
        if size:
            image = fit(image, size, method=Image.ANTIALIAS)
    
        buf = BytesIO()
        image.save(buf, 'JPEG')
        return image, buf
```

By applying the correct method for handling transparency and pasting images, we should be able to fix the bug in the `convert_image` function.
