### Error Analysis
The buggy function is supposed to convert images to the RGB mode if they are not already in this mode. However, the buggy function has a bug in the first part of the condition checking for PNG images in RGBA mode. The bug lies in the `paste` method call, which actually takes the image to paste in as the first argument, but it has been passed in twice. This leads to an incorrect background image, ultimately causing the output to differ from what's expected.

### Bug Explanation
The buggy function fails in cases where it needs to convert PNG images in RGBA mode to RGB mode. This failure is due to the incorrect usage of the `paste` method for creating a background image. The program is currently pasting the image onto itself, leading to an incorrect background image. This error results in the incorrect conversion from RGBA to RGB, causing the tests to fail.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to properly use the `paste` method to create the background image by providing the correct arguments. The image should be pasted onto a correctly created background as intended. By fixing this issue, the function should be able to correctly convert PNG images from RGBA to RGB mode.

### Corrected Version
```python
# The corrected version of the buggy function
def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
    if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA':
        background = Image.new('RGBA', image.size, (255, 255, 255))
        background.paste(image, (0, 0), image)
        image = background.convert('RGB')
    elif image.mode != 'RGB':
        image = image.convert('RGB')

    if size:
        image = image.copy()
        image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)

    buf = BytesIO()
    image.save(buf, 'JPEG')
    return image, buf
```

By correcting the `paste` method call in the buggy function, the background image will be created correctly, and the function should now be able to convert PNG images in RGBA mode to RGB mode as expected.
