### Analysis
1. The `convert_image` function is designed to convert an image to RGB mode and resize it if a size argument is provided.
2. The bug seems to occur when the input image is in PNG format and RGBA mode. The function is supposed to convert such images to RGB mode, but the resizing process is incorrect.
3. The error message indicates a mismatch in the color values after conversion, specifically for images with transparency (PNG format).
4. The bug seems to be related to the incorrect handling of transparency during resizing, causing color discrepancies.
5. We need to ensure that transparent images are correctly converted to RGB mode and resized without losing transparency.

### Bug Fix Strategy
1. Check the transparency handling for RGBA images during conversion and resizing.
2. Update the resizing process to maintain transparency.
3. Ensure that the final RGB image retains the transparency from the original RGBA image.

### Corrected Version of the Function
```python
# The corrected version of the function
def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
    if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA':
        # Create a new RGBA image with white background
        background = Image.new('RGBA', image.size, (255, 255, 255, 255))
        background.paste(image, image)
        # Convert the RGBA image to RGB while preserving transparency
        image = background.convert('RGBA').convert('RGB')
    elif image.mode != 'RGB':
        # Convert non-RGB images to RGB mode
        image = image.convert('RGB')

    # Resize the image if a size is provided, maintaining transparency
    if size:
        image = image.copy()
        image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)
    
    buf = BytesIO()
    # Save the image in JPEG format with full quality
    image.save(buf, 'JPEG', quality=100)
    return image, buf
```

By updating the transparency handling during conversion and ensuring proper resizing that maintains transparency, the corrected function should now correctly handle PNG images in RGBA mode and produce the expected results, passing the failing tests.
