### Analysis
1. The `convert_image` function is supposed to handle different cases of images and convert them to RGB format if needed. The bug seems to be related to handling PNG images in RGBA mode.
2. The bug is likely in the condition that checks for PNG images in RGBA mode and tries to convert them to RGB.
3. The failing test case demonstrates that the conversion of PNG images with a transparent background is not correctly handled, leading to incorrect color values.
4. To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the conversion of PNG images in RGBA mode correctly handles the transparent background.
5. Here is the corrected version of the `convert_image` function:

```python
def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
    if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA':
        background = Image.new('RGB', image.size, (255, 255, 255))
        background.paste(image, image)
        image = background
    elif image.mode != 'RGB':
        image = image.convert('RGB')

    if size:
        image = image.copy()
        image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)

    buf = BytesIO()
    image.save(buf, 'JPEG')
    return image, buf
```

By correcting the bug in how PNG images in RGBA mode are handled, the function should now pass the failing test cases.
