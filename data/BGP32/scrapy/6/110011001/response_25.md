### Analysis
1. The `convert_image` function in the `ImagesPipeline` class is responsible for converting images to a specific format. It checks if the image format is 'PNG' and the mode is 'RGBA', then creates a new background image with a white background and pastes the original image on it. After that, it converts the image to RGB format. If the mode of the original image is not RGB, then it converts it to RGB.
2. The bug seems to be related to the handling of transparency in PNG images. When the image is RGB and JPEG, the function works correctly, but when dealing with RGBA PNG images, the conversion causes issues.
3. The error message indicates that the colors of the image after conversion are different from the expected colors. This inconsistency suggests that the alpha channel handling may be the cause of the bug.
4. To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the transparent areas of PNG images are handled correctly when converting them to RGB. This may involve properly preserving or removing the alpha channel during conversion.
5. Here is the corrected version of the `convert_image` function:

```python
def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
    if image.mode == 'RGBA':
        image = image.convert('RGB')  # Convert RGBA images to RGB directly
    elif image.mode != 'RGB':
        image = image.convert('RGB')
    
    if size:
        image = image.copy()
        image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)
    
    buf = BytesIO()
    image.save(buf, 'JPEG')
    return image, buf
```

By directly converting RGBA images to RGB without pasting on a white background, we ensure that transparency is handled correctly. This revised approach should fix the bug and make the function work as expected.
