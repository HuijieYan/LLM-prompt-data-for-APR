### Bug Analysis
The bug in the `convert_image` function seems to be related to the handling of transparent images with RGBA mode and PNG format. The function is expected to convert such images to RGB mode. However, the bug is causing the conversion to output incorrect RGB values, leading to failed test cases due to discrepancies in color values.

### Bug Explanation
1. In the if condition `if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA'`, the background image is created with RGBA mode, and the input image is pasted onto it. This operation is incorrect because the `paste` method expects a single argument, which should be a tuple to define the position. In this case, the `image` is mistakenly passed as a second argument.
2. The condition `if image.mode != 'RGB'` converts the image to RGB mode if it is not already in this mode. However, this conversion should not occur for RGBA images since the previous condition should have handled them correctly.

### Bug Fix Strategy
1. Revise the pasting operation to ensure it follows the correct syntax for the `paste` method.
2. Avoid converting RGBA images to RGB mode when the condition for PNG format and RGBA mode is met.

### Corrected Version of the Function
```python
def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
    if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA':
        background = Image.new('RGBA', image.size, (255, 255, 255, 255))
        background.paste(image, (0, 0), image)
        image = background.convert('RGB')
    elif image.mode != 'RGB':
        image = image.convert('RGB')

    if size:
        image = image.copy()
        image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)

    buf = BytesIO()
    image.save(buf, 'JPEG')
    return image, buf
```

By correcting the paste operation and adjusting the condition for RGBA images, the function should now handle transparent images correctly and pass the failing test cases.
