### Analysis
- The buggy function is responsible for converting images to the desired format and size.
- The bug occurs when the input image is PNG with RGBA mode, causing issues in the conversion process.
- The error message indicates that the getcolors() method is returning incorrect values for converted images.
- In Case 3, the background image is being created with the wrong mode, affecting the conversion process.

### Bug Explanation
The bug occurs due to incorrect handling of images with PNG format and RGBA mode. The function is not properly converting such images, leading to incorrect results. The background created for RGBA images is not correct, impacting the final conversion.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to adjust the conversion process for PNG images with RGBA mode. Ensuring the creation of the background image and conversion steps are done correctly will resolve the issue.

### Corrected Function
```python
def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
    if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA':
        background = Image.new('RGBA', image.size, (255, 255, 255, 255))
        background.paste(image, image)
        image = background.convert('RGB')
    elif image.mode != 'RGB':
        image = image.convert('RGB')

    if size:
        image = image.copy()
        image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)

    buf = BytesIO()
    image.save(buf, 'JPEG')
    return image, buf
```

By correcting the creation of the background image for PNG images with RGBA mode and ensuring a proper conversion, the function should now handle images correctly and pass the failing tests.
