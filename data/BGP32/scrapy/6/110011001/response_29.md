### Analysis
The buggy function `convert_image` has the following issues:
1. When the input image has format `'PNG'` and mode `'RGBA'`, it incorrectly tries to convert it to RGB by pasting it on a white background and then converting the background to RGB. This process distorts the image colors.
2. It mistakenly converts images with modes other than RGB to RGB. This can cause data loss or distortion in images that are not in RGB mode.
3. The function saves the image as JPEG regardless of its original format, potentially causing format mismatch issues.

### Bug Explanation
The bug arises from incorrect handling of images based on their format and mode. When the input image is `'PNG'` and mode `'RGBA'`, pasting it on a white background and then converting to RGB alters the image colors. Additionally, the function indiscriminately converts images with modes other than RGB to RGB, which can lead to data loss or distortion. Finally, saving the image as JPEG without considering the original format can cause format mismatch issues.

### Proposed Fix
1. Modify the function to handle images with format `'PNG'` and mode `'RGBA'` separately, keeping transparency intact.
2. Only convert images to RGB if they are in a mode other than RGB.
3. Save the image using its original format to prevent format mismatch issues.

### Corrected Version
```python
def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
    if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA':
        converted = image.convert('RGBA').convert('RGB')
    else:
        converted = image.convert('RGB')
    
    if size:
        converted = converted.copy()
        converted.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)

    buf = BytesIO()
    converted.save(buf, image.format)
    return converted, buf
```
