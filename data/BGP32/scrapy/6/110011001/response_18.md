### Bug Explanation
The bug in the `convert_image` function lies in the conditional check for PNG images with RGBA mode. In this case, the function creates a new RGBA background image and then pastes the original RGBA image on it. However, the mistake occurs when calling `background.paste(image, image)` which results in pasting the original image on itself rather than a blank background. This leads to incorrect image transformation and subsequently causes the failing test cases.

### Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to paste the original RGBA image on a blank background image. This can be achieved by initializing `background` without the original image and then pasting the original image onto it. Additionally, the correct background color should be specified during the initialization.

### Corrected Version
```python
def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
    if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA':
        background = Image.new('RGBA', image.size, (255, 255, 255, 255))
        background.paste(image, (0, 0))
        image = background.convert('RGB')
    elif image.mode != 'RGB':
        image = image.convert('RGB')

    if size:
        image = image.copy()
        image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)

    buf = BytesIO()
    image.save(buf, 'JPEG')
    return image, buf
``` 

This corrected version ensures that the background image is created correctly and the original image is pasted onto it before further image transformations.
