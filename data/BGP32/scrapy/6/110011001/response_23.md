### Analysis
1. The `convert_image` function is intended to handle different image formats and modes and convert them to the desired format and mode, as well as resize the image if required.
2. The bug appears to be related to the conversion of images with format 'PNG' and mode 'RGBA', where an incorrect RGB image is being generated.
3. The error occurs when the function tries to assert the converted image's color values, which are incorrect due to the transformation.
4. To fix the bug, we should correct how the conversion for 'PNG' and 'RGBA' images is handled.
5. The conversion logic for handling 'PNG' and 'RGBA' images should be adjusted to ensure that the correct color values are preserved during the conversion process.

### Bug Fix
```python
def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
    if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA':
        background = Image.new('RGBA', image.size, (255, 255, 255, 255))  # Changed background creation with RGBA format
        background.paste(image, (0, 0))  # Adjusted pasting position
        image = background.convert('RGB')
    elif image.mode != 'RGB':
        image = image.convert('RGB')
    
    if size:
        image = image.copy()
        image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)
    
    buf = BytesIO()
    image.save(buf, 'JPEG')
    return image, buf
```

By modifying the way the background is created, ensuring its alpha channel is properly set, and adjusting the pasting coordinates, the bug related to the incorrect color values for 'PNG' and 'RGBA' images should be fixed.
