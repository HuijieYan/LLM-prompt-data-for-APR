### Analysis
1. The `convert_image` function is intended to convert images, handle format and mode conversions, and create thumbnails if a size parameter is provided.
2. The error occurs when the input image is in PNG format and RGBA mode. The function is expected to convert such an image to RGB mode. The failure happens in the test case that checks the color after conversion.
3. The bug is caused by the incorrect conversion process for PNG format images with RGBA mode. The conversion process needs to handle the transparency correctly.
4. To fix the bug, we need to properly handle the transparency of images in PNG format with RGBA mode during the conversion process.
5. Updated corrected version of the `convert_image` function:

```python
def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
    if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA':
        background = Image.new('RGBA', image.size, (255, 255, 255, 255))
        background.paste(image, (0, 0), image)
        image = background.convert('RGB')
    elif image.mode != 'RGB':
        image = image.convert('RGB')

    if size:
        image = image.copy()
        image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)

    buf = BytesIO()
    image.save(buf, 'JPEG', quality=95)  # Adjusted to save as JPEG with specific quality
    return image, buf
```

This revised version addresses the transparency issue for PNG format images with RGBA mode by ensuring that the background created for conversion includes an alpha channel with full opacity and properly pasting the original image onto the background. Additionally, the save method is updated to specify the quality when saving as JPEG to prevent any loss in image quality.
