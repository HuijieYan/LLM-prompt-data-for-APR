### Analysis
The buggy function `convert_image` is designed to handle image conversion and resizing using the PIL library. The issue arises when dealing with PNG images with RGBA mode; it fails to properly handle transparency leading to incorrect color values. The bug seems to be in the conditional logic where the function checks if the image format is PNG and mode is RGBA, then performs some color transformation incorrectly.

### Cause of the Bug
1. The bug occurs when the function encounters an image with PNG format and RGBA mode.
2. The `convert_image` function incorrectly handles the transparency by converting the image to RGB directly, leading to color distortion when transparency is involved, resulting in mismatched color values in the output image.
3. The bug is triggered when the function is passed an image with PNG format, RGBA mode, and transparency.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, the handling of PNG images with RGBA mode needs to be adjusted to preserve transparency and correctly convert RGBA to RGB. This can be achieved by ensuring that the transparency is retained during the conversion process.

### Corrected Version of the Function
```python
def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
    if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA':
        background = Image.new('RGBA', image.size, (255, 255, 255, 255))
        background.paste(image, (0, 0), image)
        image = background.convert('RGB')
    elif image.mode != 'RGB':
        image = image.convert('RGB')

    if size:
        image = image.copy()
        image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)

    buf = BytesIO()
    image.save(buf, 'JPEG')
    return image, buf
```

With this corrected version, the function is now able to properly handle PNG images with RGBA mode and transparency, preserving the correct colors during the image conversion and resizing processes.
