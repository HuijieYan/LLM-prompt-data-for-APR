### Bug Analysis:
The `convert_image` function is meant to handle image conversions and thumbnail creation. However, there are a few issues in the current implementation:
1. When dealing with PNG images in RGBA mode, the function incorrectly tries to convert them to RGB by pasting the image on a new RGBA background and then converting it to RGB. This approach might result in unexpected color changes or loss of transparency information.
2. When the input image is not in RGB mode, the function correctly converts it to RGB, but it should handle other modes as well.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to:
1. Correct the RGB conversion for RGBA PNG images to preserve transparency.
2. Ensure that the function handles image modes other than RGB properly.

### Corrected Function:
```python
def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
    if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA':
        image = image.convert('RGB')
    elif image.mode != 'RGB':
        image = image.convert('RGB')

    if size:
        image = image.copy()
        image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)

    buf = BytesIO()
    image.save(buf, 'JPEG')
    return image, buf
```

### Changes Made:
1. Removed the unnecessary creation of a white background and pasting the image for RGBA PNG conversion.
2. Directly converted RGBA PNG images to RGB to preserve transparency.
3. Updated the `elif` condition to also consider RGBA and other modes for conversion to RGB.

This corrected version should address the issues and pass the failing test cases.
