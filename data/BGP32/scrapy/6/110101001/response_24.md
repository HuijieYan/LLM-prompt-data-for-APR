### Analysis:
The buggy function `convert_image` is designed to convert an image to RGB format and generate a thumbnail if a size is provided. The bug seems to be related to handling PNG images with an RGBA mode, where it first creates a white background image but incorrectly pastes the original image onto the background, leading to unexpected results.

### Bug:
The bug occurs when processing PNG images with an RGBA mode. Specifically, the issue lies in the line `background.paste(image, image)`, where the original image is mistakenly pasted onto itself, rather than onto the white background created. This results in incorrect channel mixing and image distortion.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to correct the pasting logic to ensure the original image is pasted onto the white background correctly. We should also consider other edge cases like handling transparency in images and converting images with different modes.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
    if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA':
        background = Image.new('RGBA', image.size, (255, 255, 255))
        background.paste(image, (0, 0), image)
        image = background.convert('RGB')
    elif image.mode != 'RGB':
        image = image.convert('RGB')

    if size:
        image = image.copy()
        image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)

    buf = BytesIO()
    image.save(buf, 'JPEG')
    return image, buf
```

By correcting the pasting logic with `background.paste(image, (0, 0), image)` and ensuring proper handling of different image modes, the function should now correctly convert images to RGB format and generate thumbnails as intended.
