### Bug Explanation:
The bug in the `convert_image` function lies in the condition that converts an RGBA image to RGB. The bug causes the alpha channel information to be lost during the conversion of PNG images with RGBA mode. This results in a loss of transparency in the image, which is not desired.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix this bug, we need to ensure that transparency is preserved when converting PNG images from RGBA mode to RGB mode. This can be achieved by creating a white background image with an alpha channel if the original image is PNG with RGBA mode. Then paste the original image on this background image before converting it to RGB.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
    if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA':
        background = Image.new('RGBA', image.size, (255, 255, 255, 255))  # Create a white RGBA background image
        background.paste(image, (0, 0), image)  # Paste the original RGBA image on the background
        image = background.convert('RGB')  # Convert the pasted image to RGB
    elif image.mode != 'RGB':
        image = image.convert('RGB')
    
    if size:
        image = image.copy()
        image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)
    
    buf = BytesIO()
    image.save(buf, 'JPEG')
    return image, buf
```

By updating the function as shown above, the bug should be fixed, and the function should now preserve transparency when converting PNG images from RGBA mode to RGB mode. This corrected version should pass the failing test cases provided.
