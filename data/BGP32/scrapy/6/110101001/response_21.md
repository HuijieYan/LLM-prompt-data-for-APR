### Bug Explanation
The bug in the `convert_image` function arises from the conditional check `if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA'`. When the input image has a format of 'PNG' and mode of 'RGBA', the code mistakenly converts the image to RGB format by creating a new background image with a white background and pasting the original image onto it. This incorrect conversion logic leads to unexpected results and fails the test cases where transparency needs to be preserved.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug in the `convert_image` function, we need to adjust the logic for handling PNG images with RGBA mode. Instead of converting the image to RGB with a white background, we should handle PNG images with transparency correctly and maintain the RGBA mode when needed.

### Corrected Version of the Function
```python
def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
    if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA':
        # Preserve transparency for PNG images with RGBA mode
        image = image.convert('RGBa')
    elif image.mode != 'RGB':
        image = image.convert('RGB')

    if size:
        image = image.copy()
        image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)

    buf = BytesIO()
    image.save(buf, 'JPEG')
    return image, buf
```

By updating the logic to correctly handle PNG images with RGBA mode, we ensure that transparency is preserved during the image conversion process. The corrected function should now pass the failing test cases provided.
