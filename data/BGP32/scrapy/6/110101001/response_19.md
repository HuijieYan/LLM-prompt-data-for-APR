### Analysis:
The buggy function `convert_image` is intended to handle image conversion and thumbnail generation. However, there are some issues in the function that result in failing tests. Here's a breakdown of the problems identified:
1. The function incorrectly handles PNG images with RGBA mode. It attempts to convert them to RGB by creating a new image with a white background and pasting the original image on it. This may lead to unexpected results.
2. When generating thumbnails, the function makes a copy of the image before applying the size constraints but fails to replace the original image with the resized version.

### Bug Cause:
1. In Case 3, the function incorrectly converts PNG RGBA images to RGB by creating a new image with a white background and pasting the original image. This process is flawed and leads to incorrect image format.
2. In Case 2, the function fails to update the image variable with the resized version after generating a thumbnail, resulting in incorrect comparison with the expected thumbnail size.

### Fix Strategy:
1. Adjust the handling of PNG RGBA images to properly convert them to RGB.
2. Ensure that the function correctly updates the image variable with the resized version after generating a thumbnail.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
    if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA':
        converted_image = image.convert('RGB')
    elif image.mode != 'RGB':
        converted_image = image.convert('RGB')
    else:
        converted_image = image

    if size:
        thumb = converted_image.copy()
        thumb.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)
    else:
        thumb = converted_image

    buf = BytesIO()
    thumb.save(buf, 'JPEG')
    
    return thumb, buf
```

In the corrected version, we address the issues mentioned earlier by properly converting PNG RGBA images to RGB and updating the image variable with the resized version after generating a thumbnail. This updated version should pass the failing tests.
