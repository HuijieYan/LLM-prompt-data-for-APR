### Potential Error Locations
1. The condition `if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA'` might not be handling the RGBA format correctly since it seems to fall into the `else` block when the format is PNG and the mode is RGBA.
2. The process of creating a new image with a white background and pasting the original image onto it might not be functioning as intended, leading to incorrect results.
3. Saving the image as 'JPEG' format regardless of its original format might be causing issues with transparency when converting from PNG to RGB.

### Cause of the Bug
The bug seems to stem from incorrect handling of PNG format with RGBA mode. This is likely causing incorrect conversions and unexpected results, especially when dealing with transparency.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug
1. Adjust the condition for PNG and RGBA to handle transparency properly.
2. Ensure that the image conversion processes are consistent and preserve the original image characteristics.

### Corrected Version of the Function
```python
def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
    if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA':
        background = Image.new('RGBA', image.size, (255, 255, 255, 255))
        background.paste(image, (0, 0), image)
        image = background.convert('RGB')
    elif image.mode != 'RGB':
        image = image.convert('RGB')

    if size:
        image = image.copy()
        image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)

    buf = BytesIO()
    image.save(buf, format=image.format)
    return image, buf
```

By adjusting the creation of the background image with the correct RGBA format, pasting the original image correctly, and saving the image based on its original format, this corrected version should address the issues identified and pass the failing test cases.
