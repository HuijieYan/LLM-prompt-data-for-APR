### Analysis
The buggy function `convert_image` is designed to handle image conversions and thumbnail generation. However, there are a few issues that need to be addressed:
1. The condition to check if the image format is 'PNG' and mode is 'RGBA' is incorrect. This leads to an issue when converting such images.
2. When pasting the image onto a background, the `paste` method is used incorrectly which affects the output.
3. The conversion to 'RGB' mode is intended for images with transparency, but the implementation is incorrect.

### Bug Explanation
1. In Case 3, the input image is 'PNG' format with 'RGBA' mode. The buggy code tries to convert it to 'RGB', but in the process of creating a new 'RGBA' background and pasting the original image onto it, the resulting image is incorrect. This leads to a failed test case due to an incorrect output image in 'RGB' mode.
2. In Case 4, the input image is initially in 'P' mode, which should have transparent images being handled as 'RGB' mode for simplicity. However, the conversion process results in an incorrect 'RGB' image.

### Fix Strategy
1. Correct the condition to check for 'PNG' format and 'RGBA' mode. Only create a white background if the image is in 'RGBA' mode.
2. Use the `paste` method correctly while creating a background for images with transparency.
3. Handle the conversion of images with transparency correctly to maintain the expected behavior.

### Corrected Version
```python
def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
    if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA':
        background = Image.new('RGBA', image.size, (255, 255, 255, 255))
        background.paste(image, (0, 0), image)
        image = background.convert('RGB')
    elif image.mode != 'RGB':
        image = image.convert('RGB')

    if size:
        image = image.copy()
        image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)

    buf = BytesIO()
    image.save(buf, 'JPEG')
    return image, buf
```

By making these corrections, the function should now properly handle the conversion and thumbnail generation for the given input images and pass the failing tests.
