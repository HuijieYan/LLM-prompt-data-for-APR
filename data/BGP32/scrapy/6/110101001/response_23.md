### Potential Error Locations
1. The condition `if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA':` might not be handling the RGBA format correctly.
2. The background image might not be pasted correctly onto the new image.
3. The conversion to RGB might not be fully effective for transparency cases.

### Cause of the Bug
The failing test cases involve scenarios where the input images have different modes (such as RGBA) and formats (such as PNG), which the current implementation of the `convert_image` function does not handle correctly. The conversion logic for RGBA is flawed, and transparency is not handled properly, resulting in incorrect image modes and colors.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug
1. Update the RGBA to RGB conversion logic to properly handle transparency.
2. Ensure that the background image is pasted correctly onto the new image.
3. Adjust the conversion process to handle different input image modes and formats effectively.

### Corrected Version of the `convert_image` Function
Here is the corrected version of the `convert_image` function:

```python
def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
    if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA':
        background = Image.new('RGB', image.size, (255, 255, 255))
        background.paste(image, (0, 0), image)
        image = background
    elif image.mode != 'RGB':
        image = image.convert('RGB')

    if size:
        image = image.copy()
        image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)

    buf = BytesIO()
    image.save(buf, 'JPEG')
    return image, buf
```

By making the stated corrections, the function should now properly handle different image modes and formats, ensuring that the failing test cases pass successfully.
