### Analysis:
The buggy function `convert_image` is intended to convert images to RGB mode and save them as JPEG format. However, there are issues in the implementation:
1. In the case where the input image format is 'PNG' and mode is 'RGBA', the function creates a new RGBA background image and then tries to paste the original image onto this background. However, the paste operation should be done using the `paste` method of the background image, not the `paste` method of the original image itself.
2. After the background is created and pasted with the original image, the function needs to convert the new image to RGB mode, but it mistakenly updates the original image variable with the converted background image instead.
3. In the final step, when saving the image, the function specifies 'JPEG' format, while it should save it based on the input image format.

### Bug Cause:
The bug causes the function to not handle PNG images with RGBA mode correctly, leading to incorrect image conversion and saving.

### Fix Strategy:
1. Adjust the image pasting logic to correctly paste the original image onto the background.
2. Assign the resulting image from the correct paste operation to a new variable instead of modifying the input image directly.
3. Save the image in the correct format based on the input image.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
    if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA':
        background = Image.new('RGBA', image.size, (255, 255, 255))
        background.paste(image, (0, 0), image)
        new_image = background.convert('RGB')
    elif image.mode != 'RGB':
        new_image = image.convert('RGB')

    if size:
        new_image = new_image.copy()
        new_image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)

    buf = BytesIO()
    new_image.save(buf, format=image.format)
    return new_image, buf
``` 

By making these adjustments, the corrected function should now handle PNG images with RGBA mode correctly and save the images in the expected format.
