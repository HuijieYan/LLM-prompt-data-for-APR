### Bug Explanation
The bug in the `convert_image` function lies in the condition for handling PNG images with RGBA mode. When the image format is PNG and the mode is RGBA, the function is supposed to create a new RGBA image with a white background and then convert it to RGB. However, the buggy code pastes the original image onto the white background instead of just using the white background. This leads to an unexpected result where the transparency is not properly handled.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to correct the way the white background is utilized for PNG images with RGBA mode. Instead of pasting the original image onto the background, we should create a blank white RGBA image that will be later converted to RGB.

### Corrected Function

```python
def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
    if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA':
        background = Image.new('RGBA', image.size, (255, 255, 255, 255))  # Corrected: Adding alpha channel to the background color
        image = Image.alpha_composite(background, image).convert('RGB')  # Corrected: Compositing images preserving alpha transparency
    elif image.mode != 'RGB':
        image = image.convert('RGB')

    if size:
        image = image.copy()
        image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)

    buf = BytesIO()
    image.save(buf, 'JPEG')
    return image, buf
```

By correcting the code as described above, the function should now handle PNG images with RGBA mode correctly and pass the failing test cases.
