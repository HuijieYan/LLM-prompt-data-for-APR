### Analysis
The bug in the `convert_image` function seems to be related to the handling of images with transparency. In the cases provided:
- Case 1 and Case 2 deal with images in RGB format, which should be handled correctly.
- Case 3 involves an image in RGBA format that needs to be converted to RGB.
- Case 4 involves an image with transparency that is initially in mode 'P', which needs to be handled correctly as well.

The bug appears to stem from the conditional check for PNG format and RGBA mode, where the image is getting converted incorrectly. The issue seems to be in the way the alpha channel is handled during image conversion.

### Bug Explanation
- In Case 3, when the image format is PNG and the mode is RGBA, the code creates a new background image with RGBA mode, pastes the original image onto it, and then converts it to RGB mode. The alpha channel is getting lost during this process.
- The `paste` method should be used with the `mask` parameter to ensure that the alpha channel is preserved.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to modify the code in the PNG and RGBA condition where the image conversion takes place. Instead of pasting the original image onto a new background and converting it to RGB, we should paste the original image with the correct mask to preserve the alpha channel.

### Corrected Version of the Function
Here is a corrected version of the `convert_image` function:

```python
def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
    if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA':
        background = Image.new('RGBA', image.size, (255, 255, 255, 255))
        background.paste(image, (0, 0), image.split()[3])  # Paste with alpha channel as mask
        image = background.convert('RGB')
    elif image.mode != 'RGB':
        image = image.convert('RGB')

    if size:
        image = image.copy()
        image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)

    buf = BytesIO()
    image.save(buf, 'JPEG')
    return image, buf
```

With this corrected version, the alpha channel should be preserved correctly during the conversion process for images with transparency, and the test cases should pass successfully.
