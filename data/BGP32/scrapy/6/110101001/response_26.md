### Cause of the Bug:
The bug in the `convert_image` function arises from the condition where it checks if the input image's format is 'PNG' and mode is 'RGBA'. In this condition, it creates a new background image and attempts to paste the original image onto it. However, the `paste` method does not work as intended, leading to the incorrect conversion of the image. This condition should handle transparency in a different way to correctly convert the image.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to handle the transparency case differently for images with format 'PNG' and mode 'RGBA'. Instead of attempting to paste the original image onto a new background, the transparency should be addressed properly to maintain the alpha values in the resulting image.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
    if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA':
        background = Image.new('RGBA', image.size, (255, 255, 255, 255))
        background.paste(image, (0, 0), image)
        image = background.convert('RGB')
    elif image.mode != 'RGB':
        image = image.convert('RGB')

    if size:
        image = image.copy()
        image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)

    buf = BytesIO()
    image.save(buf, 'JPEG')
    return image, buf
```

By making these adjustments, the `convert_image` function should now properly handle images with transparency while maintaining the correct color values and image format conversions.
