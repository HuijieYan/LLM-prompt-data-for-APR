### Bug Explanation
The bug in the `convert_image` function lies in the condition where it checks if the image format is `'PNG'` and the mode is `'RGBA'`. If this condition is True, it creates a new background image with the same size as the input image and pastes the input image onto it, expecting to handle transparency. However, the bug is in the line `background.paste(image, image)`, where the second parameter should be a box tuple, representing the region to paste the image. Passing `image` as the second parameter leads to unexpected behavior and results in incorrect image conversion.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug in the `convert_image` function, we need to ensure that transparency is properly handled when the image format is PNG and the mode is RGBA. Specifically, we need to modify the `background.paste` line to correctly paste the input image onto the background image using a box tuple. Additionally, the conversion logic should be adjusted to handle RGBA images correctly.

### Corrected Version
```python
def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
    if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA':
        background = Image.new('RGBA', image.size, (255, 255, 255))
        background.paste(image, (0, 0, image.size[0], image.size[1]))  # Paste image using a box tuple
        image = background.convert('RGB')
    elif image.mode != 'RGB':
        image = image.convert('RGB')
    
    if size:
        image = image.copy()
        image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)
    
    buf = BytesIO()
    image.save(buf, 'JPEG')
    return image, buf
```

By making the necessary changes to correctly paste the image onto the background in the RGBA PNG case and adjusting the conversion logic, the corrected version of the `convert_image` function should now pass the failing tests.
