### Analysis
1. The buggy function `convert_image` in the `ImagesPipeline` class is responsible for converting images to a specified format and size.
2. The function checks the image format and mode and performs conversions accordingly.
3. There are potential issues in handling RGBA images and converting them to RGB.
4. The bug occurs when trying to convert RGBA PNG images to RGB.
5. The bug arises due to incorrect handling of RGBA images in the conversion process.

### Bug Cause
The bug occurs because the code does not correctly handle the conversion of RGBA PNG images to RGB. When the input image is in RGBA mode and the format is PNG, the function creates a new RGB image with a white background and tries to paste the RGBA image onto it. This operation does not work as intended, resulting in the incorrect conversion of the image.

### Fix Strategy
1. When the input image format is PNG and mode is RGBA, we need to convert it directly to RGB without creating a new background image.
2. Update the code to convert RGBA PNG images to RGB without changing the background.

### Corrected Version
```python
def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
    if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA':
        image = image.convert('RGB')
    elif image.mode != 'RGB':
        image = image.convert('RGB')

    if size:
        image = image.copy()
        image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)

    buf = BytesIO()
    image.save(buf, 'JPEG')
    return image, buf
``` 

By making this change, the function will correctly handle RGBA PNG images and convert them to RGB without the background issue, passing the failing test cases.
