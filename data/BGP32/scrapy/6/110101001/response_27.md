## Bug Explanation
The bug in the `convert_image` function lies in the conditional check for image format and mode. In the first conditional block, if the image format is `'PNG'` and the mode is `'RGBA'`, it creates a new background image of type `'RGBA'`, pastes the original image onto this background, and then converts it to `'RGB'`. However, the `paste` method should be called on the background image, not the image itself. This incorrect usage causes the transparency issue when converting an RGBA image to RGB.

## Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to modify the paste line to correctly paste the original image onto the background. Additionally, it would be beneficial to handle the case where the image mode is `'P'` (palette mode) to avoid potential issues with the conversion to RGB format later on.

## Corrected Function
```python
def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
    if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA':
        background = Image.new('RGBA', image.size, (255, 255, 255))
        background.paste(image, (0, 0, image.size[0], image.size[1]))  # Corrected line - paste on background
        image = background.convert('RGB')
    elif image.mode != 'RGB' and image.mode != 'P':  # Handle 'P' mode as well
        image = image.convert('RGB')

    if size:
        image = image.copy()
        image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)

    buf = BytesIO()
    image.save(buf, 'JPEG')
    return image, buf
```

By making these changes, the function now correctly pastes the original image onto the background in the correct manner and handles the conversion for the 'P' mode as needed. This corrected version should pass the failing test cases provided.
