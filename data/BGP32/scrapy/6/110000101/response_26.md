### Analysis
The buggy function `convert_image` is intended to convert an input image to a specified format and size. There are a few potential issues in the code:
1. The condition to check for image format `'PNG'` and mode `'RGBA'` may not be accurate, as image formats and modes are case-sensitive.
2. When creating a new background image for PNG with RGBA mode, it incorrectly pastes the original image to the background.
3. The function saves the image in 'JPEG' format regardless of the original image format.

### Bug cause
1. The bug may arise due to case sensitivity in checking the image format and mode directly with uppercase values.
2. Incorrect pasting of the original image onto a new background can disrupt the conversion process.
3. Saving the image always in 'JPEG' format can lead to unexpected results for images with formats other than 'JPEG'.

### Fix strategy
1. Correct the format and mode comparison to be case-sensitive.
2. Properly handle the creation of a new background image for PNG with RGBA mode.
3. Save the image in the same format as the original image to maintain consistency.

### Corrected Version
```python
def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
    if image.format.upper() == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA':
        background = Image.new('RGBA', image.size, (255, 255, 255))
        background.paste(image, (0, 0), image)
        image = background.convert('RGB')
    elif image.mode != 'RGB':
        image = image.convert('RGB')

    if size:
        image = image.copy()
        image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)

    buf = BytesIO()
    image.save(buf, format=image.format)
    return image, buf
```

This corrected version of the `convert_image` function addresses the identified issues:
- It ensures the image format comparison is case-insensitive by using `upper()`.
- Corrects the pasting of the original image onto a new background.
- Saves the image in the same format as the original image using `format=image.format`.
