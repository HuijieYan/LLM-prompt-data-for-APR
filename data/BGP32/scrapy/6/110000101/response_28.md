### Analyzing the buggy function
The `convert_image` function is a part of the `ImagesPipeline` class which is supposed to handle image conversions and resizing. The function takes an image object and an optional size parameter, converts the image to RGB mode if necessary, resizes it if a size is provided, and finally saves and returns the image along with a buffer containing the image data.

### Potential error locations
1. The condition to check if the image format is 'PNG' and mode is 'RGBA' might not work as expected due to case sensitivity or variations in format or mode values.
2. In the same condition, `background.paste(image, image)` seems incorrect and could potentially lead to an error.
3. When saving the image, the format 'JPEG' is hardcoded, which might not be suitable for all cases.

### Cause of the bug
1. The condition for PNG format and RGBA mode is not robust enough and the operation to create a background using `Image.new` and `paste` is incorrect, leading to unexpected results.
2. The hardcoded 'JPEG' format while saving the image may cause issues when the input image is not necessarily a JPEG format.

### Strategy for fixing the bug
1. Revise the condition to properly check for PNG format and RGBA mode. A case-insensitive comparison should be utilized.
2. Use a try-except block to catch any potential exceptions when saving the image and handle them accordingly, possibly by using the original image format for saving.

### Corrected version of the function

```python
def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
    if image.format.upper() == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA':
        background = Image.new('RGBA', image.size, (255, 255, 255))
        background.paste(image, (0, 0))
        image = background.convert('RGB')
    elif image.mode != 'RGB':
        image = image.convert('RGB')

    if size:
        image = image.copy()
        image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)

    buf = BytesIO()
    try:
        image.save(buf, image.format)
    except IOError:
        image.save(buf, image.format)
    
    return image, buf
```

By making the aforementioned adjustments in the function, the issues related to image format checking, conversion, and saving should be resolved.
