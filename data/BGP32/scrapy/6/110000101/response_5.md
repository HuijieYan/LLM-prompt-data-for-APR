The buggy function has several issues that need to be addressed in order to achieve the expected input/output values. 

1. The first issue is with the condition `if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA'`. This condition is checking for a specific image format and mode ('PNG' and 'RGBA'), and trying to convert the image accordingly. The condition should be updated to correctly handle the specified image format and mode.

2. The second issue is with the line `background.paste(image, image)`. This line is pasting the 'image' onto the 'background', which is not the correct usage of the `paste()` method. The correct usage should be `background.paste(image, (0, 0), image)`.

3. The third issue is with the line `image.save(buf, 'JPEG')`. This line is saving the image in JPEG format regardless of the input image format. The format should be selected based on the input image format to maintain consistency.

To fix the issues mentioned above, we should correct the conditions, update the paste method usage, and save the image in the correct format based on the input image format. Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
    if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA':
        background = Image.new('RGBA', image.size, (255, 255, 255))
        background.paste(image, (0, 0), image)
        image = background.convert('RGB')
    elif image.mode != 'RGB':
        image = image.convert('RGB')

    if size:
        image = image.copy()
        image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)

    buf = BytesIO()
    if image.format:
        image.save(buf, image.format)
    return image, buf
```

This corrected version of the function should now properly handle the different image formats and sizes as per the expected input/output values provided.
