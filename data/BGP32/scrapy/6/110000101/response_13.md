The bug in the provided function "convert_image" is related to the conditions for converting the input image. The bug causes incorrect conversions or mismatches in formats and modes, leading to unexpected outputs. 

Here is the explanation of the buggy function:
- In the first condition, it checks if the image format is 'PNG' and the mode is 'RGBA'. If true, it creates a new background image with white color and pastes the original image onto it. Then, it converts the image to 'RGB'.
- In the second condition, if the image mode is not 'RGB', it converts the image to 'RGB'.
- The function then resizes the image if a size parameter is provided and saves the image in JPEG format.

The issue with the provided code is in the first condition where the background image is created with white color. The background.paste() method should be called with the image itself, not image, i.e., background.paste(image, (0, 0)). 

To fix the bug:
- Update the background.paste() line inside the first if condition to: background.paste(image, (0, 0)).

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
    if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA':
        background = Image.new('RGBA', image.size, (255, 255, 255))
        background.paste(image, (0, 0))  # Fix here
        image = background.convert('RGB')
    elif image.mode != 'RGB':
        image = image.convert('RGB')

    if size:
        image = image.copy()
        image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)

    buf = BytesIO()
    image.save(buf, 'JPEG')
    return image, buf
``` 

This correction ensures that the image is pasted correctly onto the background image and converted to the desired format.
