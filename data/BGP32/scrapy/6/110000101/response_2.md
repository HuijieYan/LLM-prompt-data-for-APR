### Analysis
The buggy function `convert_image` takes an image as input and applies some conversions, such as changing the image format to 'RGB', applying thumbnail resizing, and saving it as a JPEG file. The bug seems to be related to the conditions checking the image format and mode, as well as the thumbnail resizing process.

### Bug Explanation
1. In the condition `if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA'`, the bug is likely happening due to the comparison being case-sensitive. As per the buggy function's parameters, the expected value of `image.format` is `'JPEG'`, and the condition will fail in all test cases. 
2. In the snippet `background.paste(image, image)`, there is a mistake in pasting the image onto the background. It should be `background.paste(image, (0,0))` instead.
3. The condition `elif image.mode != 'RGB':` should not convert the image to RGB if it's not already in RGB mode. It should only convert images that are not in RGB or RGBA modes.
4. The thumbnail resizing block should check if the size parameter is provided before proceeding with resizing. Also, the thumbnail resizing operation modifies the image in-place, so creating a copy of the image before resizing is essential.

### Fix Strategy
1. Change the format comparison to case-insensitive by converting both image.format and the compared string to lowercase.
2. Correct the `background.paste(image, image)` statement by specifying the coordinates for pasting the image onto the background.
3. Adjust the condition for converting images to RGB mode to cover non-RGB and non-RGBA modes only.
4. Check for the presence of the size parameter before performing thumbnail resizing and ensure to create a copy of the image before resizing.

### Corrected Version
```python
def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
    if image.format.lower() == 'png' and image.mode == 'RGBA':
        background = Image.new('RGBA', image.size, (255, 255, 255))
        background.paste(image, (0, 0))
        image = background.convert('RGB')
    elif image.mode not in ['RGB', 'RGBA']:
        image = image.convert('RGB')

    if size:
        image = image.copy()
        thumbnail = image.copy()
        thumbnail.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)
        image.paste(thumbnail)
    
    buf = BytesIO()
    image.save(buf, 'JPEG')
    return image, buf
```

The corrected version addresses the issues mentioned and should now produce the expected output values for all the provided test cases.
