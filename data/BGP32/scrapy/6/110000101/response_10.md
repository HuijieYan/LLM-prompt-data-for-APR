### Analysis
The `convert_image` function is supposed to handle image conversion and thumbnail generation. The bug occurs in the condition where the image format is `'PNG'` and the mode is `'RGBA'`. In this case, the function incorrectly creates a new image with a white background and tries to paste the original image onto it, but the `paste` method expects a position tuple as the second argument, not an image.

### Bug Cause
The bug happens in the line `background.paste(image, image)`. Instead of passing the position to paste the image, the function mistakenly treats the second `image` as a position. This leads to the function not executing as intended.

### Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to correct how the `paste` method is being used in the function. We should change it to `background.paste(image, (0, 0, image.width, image.height))` to correctly paste the original image onto the background.

### Corrected Version
```python
def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
    if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA':
        background = Image.new('RGBA', image.size, (255, 255, 255))
        background.paste(image, (0, 0, image.width, image.height))
        image = background.convert('RGB')
    elif image.mode != 'RGB':
        image = image.convert('RGB')

    if size:
        image = image.copy()
        image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)

    buf = BytesIO()
    image.save(buf, 'JPEG')
    return image, buf
``` 

This corrected version addresses the bug by correctly pasting the image onto the background and returns the expected output for all given test cases.
