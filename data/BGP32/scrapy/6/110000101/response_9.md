### Analysis
The buggy function `convert_image` is supposed to handle image conversion and resizing. However, there are several issues present in the function that lead to incorrect results.

1. In the first condition, the code attempts to convert a PNG image with RGBA mode to RGB mode by creating a new RGBA background and pasting the image onto it. However, the `paste` method is not being used correctly, which results in an incorrect conversion.
2. The second condition converts any image that is not in RGB mode to RGB mode. This is correct, but the conversion is not handled properly in all cases.
3. The function saves the image as a JPEG format regardless of the original format, which could lead to unexpected results.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the issues identified above, the following steps can be taken:
1. Correct the image conversion from PNG with RGBA mode to RGB mode by using the `paste` method correctly.
2. Improve the conversion of images to RGB mode to handle all cases properly.
3. Update the function to save the image in the same format as the original image.

### Corrected Function
```python
def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
    if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA':
        background = Image.new('RGB', image.size, (255, 255, 255))
        background.paste(image, (0, 0), image)
        image = background
    elif image.mode != 'RGB':
        image = image.convert('RGB')

    if size:
        image = image.copy()
        image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)

    buf = BytesIO()
    image.save(buf, image.format)
    return image, buf
```
