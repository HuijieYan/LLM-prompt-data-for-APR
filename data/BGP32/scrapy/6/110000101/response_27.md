### Analysis
The buggy function `convert_image` is designed to handle different image formats and convert them to RGB format, resize the image if a size parameter is provided, and save the image as a JPEG file. There are a few potential errors in the function that need to be addressed:
1. The condition to check if the image format is 'PNG' and mode is 'RGBA' seems incorrect as the code only checks for 'PNG' format instead of 'JPEG'. This could lead to the incorrect handling of PNG images.
2. The paste operation is used incorrectly to place the image on a white background.
3. The save method specifies 'JPEG' format but does not consider the original image format which could lead to potential issues when saving images.
4. The function does not return the correct values after preprocessing the image.

### Bug Explanation
The buggy function incorrectly handles the conversion of images to RGB format, especially for PNG images with RGBA mode. The paste operation on a white background is not done correctly, leading to potential issues. Additionally, saving the image as a JPEG without considering the original format can cause problems.

### Fix Strategy
1. Correct the condition to check for 'PNG' format instead of 'JPEG'.
2. Use the correct approach to paste the image on a white background.
3. Consider the original image format while saving the image.
4. Ensure the function properly returns the modified image and buffer.

### Corrected Version
```python
from PIL import Image
from io import BytesIO

class ImagesPipeline(FilesPipeline):
    """
    Abstract pipeline that implements the image thumbnail generation logic        
    """

    def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
        if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA':
            background = Image.new('RGB', image.size, (255, 255, 255))
            background.paste(image, (0, 0), image)
            image = background.convert('RGB')
        elif image.mode != 'RGB':
            image = image.convert('RGB')
    
        if size:
            image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)
    
        buf = BytesIO()
        if image.format:
            image.save(buf, format=image.format)
        else:
            image.save(buf, format='JPEG')
        
        buf.seek(0)
        return image, buf
```

The corrected version of the function addresses the identified issues by correctly checking for 'PNG' format, handling the paste operation on a white background, considering the original image format while saving the image, and ensuring the function returns the modified image and buffer.
