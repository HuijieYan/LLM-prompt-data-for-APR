### Analysis
1. The buggy function `convert_image` takes an image as input and performs some operations on it such as converting it to RGB mode, creating a thumbnail, and saving it as a JPEG image.
2. The potential error locations in the function could be the conditional checks for image format and mode, as well as the image conversion operations.
3. The cause of the bug could be related to the incorrect handling of image formats and modes. If the image format is 'PNG' and mode is 'RGBA', the function is attempting to create a new image with a white background, but the pasting operation seems incorrect. Additionally, when converting to RGB mode, the existing image may not be retained properly.
4. To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the conditional checks for image format and mode are correct, and the image conversion operations are done accurately to retain the image data.

### Fix
```python
def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
    if image.mode == 'RGBA':
        background = Image.new('RGB', image.size, (255, 255, 255))
        background.paste(image, (0, 0), image)
        image = background
    elif image.mode != 'RGB':
        image = image.convert('RGB')
    
    if size:
        image = image.copy()
        image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)
    
    buf = BytesIO()
    image.save(buf, 'JPEG')
    return image, buf
```

This fixed version of the `convert_image` function correctly handles the image format and mode conditions, sets the correct background for RGBA images, and pastes the image correctly. The function ensures that the image is converted to RGB mode when necessary, creates a thumbnail if a size is specified, and saves the image as a JPEG file.
