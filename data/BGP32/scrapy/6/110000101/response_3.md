### Analysis
The buggy function `convert_image` is supposed to convert an image to either RGB format or resize it. However, there are several issues in the code that need to be addressed:

1. The condition to check if the image format is 'PNG' and the mode is 'RGBA' is incorrect. The condition should be `image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA'` instead of `image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode != 'RGBA'`.
2. In the case where the image format is 'PNG' and the mode is 'RGBA', the code creates a new background image but mistakenly pastes the original image onto itself instead of the background image.
3. The image is incorrectly converted to RGB format after pasting onto the background, resulting in a loss of transparency in the PNG image.
4. The function saves the image as a JPEG file regardless of the input image format, which may cause unexpected behavior.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug
To fix the bug, we need to:
1. Correct the condition for checking the image format and mode.
2. Use the correct method to paste the image onto the background.
3. Save the image in its original format or convert it to RGB only if necessary.

### Corrected Version of the Function

```python
def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
    if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA':
        background = Image.new('RGBA', image.size, (255, 255, 255))
        background.paste(image, (0, 0), image)
        image = background.convert('RGBA')
    elif image.mode != 'RGB':
        image = image.convert('RGB')

    if size:
        image = image.copy()
        image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)

    buf = BytesIO()
    image.save(buf, image.format)
    return image, buf
``` 

By fixing the issues mentioned above, the corrected function should now correctly handle the conversion and resizing of images according to the expected input/output values.
