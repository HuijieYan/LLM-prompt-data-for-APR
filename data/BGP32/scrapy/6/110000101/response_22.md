### Analysis:
The buggy function `convert_image` is designed to handle converting and resizing images. However, there are a few issues that need to be addressed:
1. The condition to check if the image format is `'PNG'` and the mode is `'RGBA'` is incorrect. The condition should check if the format is `'PNG'` and the mode is `'RGBA'`, not the mode alone.
2. When pasting the image onto a new background, the paste method should use the `image` as the source instead of `(255, 255, 255)`.
3. The function saves the converted image as a JPEG file regardless of the input format, which may cause issues.
4. The function returns both the image and the buffer containing the image data, but the buffer is not being reset before saving the image into it, which may lead to incorrect results in certain scenarios.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to:
1. Update the condition to correctly check if the image format is `'PNG'` and the mode is `'RGBA'`.
2. Correct the paste method to use the `image` as the source when creating a new background.
3. Adjust the image saving method to save according to the input format.
4. Reset the buffer before saving the image into it to prevent any issues.

### Corrected Version:
```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: scrapy/pipelines/images.py

# The declaration of the class containing the corrected function
class ImagesPipeline(FilesPipeline):
    """
    Abstract pipeline that implement the image thumbnail generation logic
    
        
    """

    def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
        if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA':
            background = Image.new('RGB', image.size, (255, 255, 255))
            background.paste(image, (0, 0))
            image = background.convert('RGB')
        elif image.mode != 'RGB':
            image = image.convert('RGB')
    
        if size:
            image = image.copy()
            image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)
    
        buf = BytesIO()
        image.save(buf, image.format)
        buf.seek(0)  # Reset the buffer position
        return image, buf
```

By making these corrections, the `convert_image` function should now properly handle different image formats and sizes, ensuring the correct conversion and resizing of images.
