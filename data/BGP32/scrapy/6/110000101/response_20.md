### Analysis
The buggy function `convert_image` is intended to handle converting and resizing images in the correct format. The potential errors lie in the conditional statements that check the image format and mode. The buggy function currently does not handle the cases of images with format 'JPEG' and mode 'RGB' correctly, leading to potential issues in converting and resizing these images.

### Bug Explanation
1. In the first condition (`if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA'`), the code intends to handle images in PNG format and RGBA mode by creating a new image with RGB mode, but then tries to save it as a JPEG image. This inconsistency can lead to issues.
2. In the second condition (`elif image.mode != 'RGB'`), the code attempts to convert any image that is not in RGB mode to RGB mode. However, this logic does not consider images in JPEG format, which should be handled differently.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to:
1. Modify the conditions to correctly handle images in JPEG format and RGB mode.
2. Consider images in JPEG format separately for conversion and resizing.
3. Ensure that the final image is saved in the correct format based on the input image format.

### Corrected Version of the Function
```python
def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
    if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA':
        background = Image.new('RGB', image.size, (255, 255, 255))
        background.paste(image, (0, 0), image)
        image = background
    elif image.format == 'JPEG' and image.mode != 'RGB':
        image = image.convert('RGB')

    if size:
        image = image.copy()
        image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)

    buf = BytesIO()
    if image.format == 'PNG':
        image.save(buf, 'PNG')
    else:  # Assume JPEG if not PNG
        image.save(buf, 'JPEG')
    
    return image, buf
```

With these corrections, the function now correctly handles images in PNG and JPEG formats, ensuring that the image conversion and resizing are applied appropriately for each case. The final image is saved in the correct format based on the input image format.
