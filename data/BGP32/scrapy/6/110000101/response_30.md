### Analysis
The buggy function is intended to convert an input image to RGB format and resize it if a size is provided. However, there are issues in the code that cause it to not work as expected.

#### Potential Error Locations:
1. In the first if condition, the format check should be case-insensitive.
2. In the background.paste() method, the syntax is incorrect and the correct syntax should be `background.paste(image, (0, 0), image)`
3. In the third case, if the image mode is not 'RGB', the code should convert it to 'RGB' format before resizing.
4. The `image.save()` method should specify the correct format as 'JPEG' while saving the image to the buffer.

### Bug Explanation:
1. Case 1 and Case 2 fail because the condition to check image format is case-sensitive, leading to the conversion not happening.
2. Case 3 fails because of incorrect usage of the .paste() method, which results in a wrong background to be created.
3. Case 4 fails because the correct format is not set while saving the image.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Fix the case-sensitive format check by converting the image format to uppercase before comparison.
2. Correct the syntax inside the 'if' block to properly paste the image onto the background.
3. Ensure the image is converted to the correct format in all cases where it's needed.
4. Set the correct format when saving the image using the .save() method.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
    if image.format.upper() == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA':
        background = Image.new('RGBA', image.size, (255, 255, 255))
        background.paste(image, (0, 0), image)
        image = background.convert('RGB')
    elif image.mode != 'RGB':
        image = image.convert('RGB')

    if size:
        image = image.copy()
        image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)

    buf = BytesIO()
    image.save(buf, 'JPEG')
    return image, buf
```
