### Analysis
The buggy function `convert_image` is intended to convert the input image to RGB mode and optionally resize it. However, there are several issues in the current implementation that prevent it from working correctly:
1. When the input image format is 'PNG' and mode is 'RGBA', the function tries to create a new background image in 'RGBA', pastes the input image onto it, and converts it to 'RGB'. However, the paste method call is incorrect, which results in not pasting the input image onto the background.
2. The `save` method is called with the format 'JPEG', regardless of the input image format. This may cause an error if the input image is in a different format.
3. In cases where the input image mode is not 'RGB', the conversion to 'RGB' is being done correctly.

### Bug Explanation
In the case where the input image format is 'PNG' and mode is 'RGBA', the buggy function fails to paste the input image onto the newly created background image due to a mistake in the `paste` method invocation. This results in the image not being properly converted to 'RGB'. Furthermore, calling `image.save(buf, 'JPEG')` can cause an error if the input image format is not 'JPEG'.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to correct the implementation of pasting the input image onto the background image and ensure that the `save` method is called with the correct format based on the input image format. Additionally, we should ensure that the resizing operation is performed correctly for all cases to meet the expectations outlined in the test cases.

### Corrected Version
```python
def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
    if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA':
        background = Image.new('RGBA', image.size, (255, 255, 255))
        background.paste(image, (0, 0, image.size[0], image.size[1]))
        image = background.convert('RGB')
    elif image.mode != 'RGB':
        image = image.convert('RGB')

    if size:
        image = image.copy()
        image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)

    format = 'JPEG' if image.format == 'PNG' else image.format
    buf = BytesIO()
    image.save(buf, format)
    return image, buf
```

The corrected version addresses the issues by fixing the paste method call for the 'PNG' and 'RGBA' case, correcting the format passed to the `save` method based on the input image format, and ensuring proper resizing for all cases.
