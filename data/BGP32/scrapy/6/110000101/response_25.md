### Identified bug:
The bug in the `convert_image` function is related to the check for PNG images with RGBA mode. When the condition `if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA'` is met, the code tries to create a new image (`background`) with RGBA mode, paste the original image into the new image, and then convert the new image to RGB mode. However, the `paste` method is not used correctly, resulting in the incorrect conversion of the image.

### Bug explanation:
1. In the case where the input image is a PNG image with RGBA mode, the code creates a new RGBA image named `background` with a white background and the same size as the original image.
2. The `paste` method is used incorrectly with `background.paste(image, image)`, where the second `image` argument should be a box tuple or another image. This results in an incorrect paste operation that distorts the image data.
3. After the incorrect paste operation, the code then converts the `background` image to RGB mode, which doesn't undo the distortions caused by the incorrect paste.

### Fix strategy:
To fix this bug, the `paste` method should be used correctly to paste the original image onto the background image. Then, the conversion to RGB mode should happen properly. This method ensures that the original image data is retained during the conversion process.

### Corrected version of the function:
```python
def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
    if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA':
        background = Image.new('RGBA', image.size, (255, 255, 255))
        background.paste(image, (0, 0), image.split()[3])
        image = background.convert('RGB')
    elif image.mode != 'RGB':
        image = image.convert('RGB')

    if size:
        image = image.copy()
        image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)

    buf = BytesIO()
    image.save(buf, 'JPEG')
    return image, buf
```

With this correction, the `paste` method correctly pastes the original image onto the background with an alpha channel split. This ensures that the image data is correctly retained and then converted to RGB mode without distortions.
