## Analysis:
1. The buggy function `convert_image()` is not handling the case where the input image has RGBA format, causing a discrepancy in the output when converting it to RGB.
2. The error message indicates that the converted image colors are not as expected, leading to the test failure.
3. The bug is caused by incorrectly converting RGBA format images to RGB, which results in color differences that are not accounted for.
4. To fix the bug, we need to handle the specific case where the input image has RGBA format and apply the appropriate conversion to ensure consistency in the output colors.
5. By updating the function to correctly handle RGBA to RGB conversion, we can address the issue and pass the failing test.

## Revised Function:
```python
def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
    if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA':
        background = Image.new('RGB', image.size, (255, 255, 255))
        background.paste(image, image)
        image = background.convert('RGB')
    elif image.mode != 'RGB':
        image = image.convert('RGB')

    if size:
        image = image.copy()
        image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)

    buf = BytesIO()
    image.save(buf, 'JPEG')
    return image, buf
``` 

By correcting the RGB format in the new `Image.new()` call for RGBA images and applying the required conversion, the function can now handle RGBA images properly during the conversion process. This fix should resolve the color discrepancy and thus the failing test case.
