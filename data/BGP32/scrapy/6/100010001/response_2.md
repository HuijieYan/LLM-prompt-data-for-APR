## Analysis:
1. The error message indicates a failure in the test case related to converting an image from RGBA to RGB format.
2. The bug is likely due to incorrect handling of the transparency channel in the RGBA image format during conversion.
3. When an image is in RGBA format, the alpha channel (transparency) needs to be considered while converting it to RGB format.
4. To fix the bug, we need to properly handle the alpha channel when converting RGBA images to RGB format.

## Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Check if the image being converted is in RGBA format.
2. If the image is in RGBA format, create a new RGBA image with a white background.
3. Paste the original image onto the white background to ensure proper handling of transparency.
4. Convert the new RGBA image to RGB format, considering the transparency channel.
5. Update the function to ensure correctness in converting images, especially those with transparency.

## Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
# The corrected version of the function without the bug
def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
    if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA':
        background = Image.new('RGBA', image.size, (255, 255, 255, 255))  # Include alpha channel for background
        background.paste(image, image)
        image = background.convert('RGB')
    elif image.mode != 'RGB':
        image = image.convert('RGB')

    if size:
        image = image.copy()
        image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)

    buf = BytesIO()
    image.save(buf, 'JPEG')
    return image, buf
```

By updating the function to properly handle the alpha channel in RGBA images during conversion to RGB format, the bug should be fixed and the test case should pass successfully.
