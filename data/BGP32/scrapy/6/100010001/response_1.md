### Analysis:
- The buggy function is responsible for converting images to a specific format and size. The bug lies in the handling of PNG images with the 'RGBA' mode.
- The error message indicates that the test is failing due to a difference in the colors of the converted image.
- Specifically, the conversion of an image with RGBA mode to an RGB mode image is resulting in different colors than expected.

### Bug:
- The bug occurs in the handling of PNG images with RGBA mode. When converting from RGBA to RGB, the colors are not being properly handled, leading to a mismatch in color values.

### Fix Strategy:
- When handling PNG images with RGBA mode, ensure that transparency is managed correctly to avoid color discrepancies.
- Correctly handle the conversion process from RGBA to RGB to preserve the colors of the image.

### Corrected Function:
```python
def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
    if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA':
        background = Image.new('RGBA', image.size, (255, 255, 255))
        image = Image.alpha_composite(background, image).convert('RGB')
    elif image.mode != 'RGB':
        image = image.convert('RGB')

    if size:
        image = image.copy()
        image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)

    buf = BytesIO()
    image.save(buf, 'JPEG')
    return image, buf
```

This corrected version includes a correction in converting PNG images with an RGBA mode to preserve the colors correctly. By using `Image.alpha_composite`, transparency in the image is managed appropriately, ensuring that the colors match the expected output during the conversion process.
