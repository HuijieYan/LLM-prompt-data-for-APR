#### Analysis:
- The function `convert_image` is failing the test case with the given error message.
- The error message indicates a difference in colors returned by the `getcolors` method after the conversion, specifically for the RGBA to RGB conversion.

#### Error Location:
- The bug is likely occurring in the block where the image format is 'PNG' and the mode is 'RGBA'.
- The conversion of RGBA to RGB is not being handled correctly, leading to incorrect color values returned by `getcolors`.

#### Bug Cause:
- In the existing code, when the image format is 'PNG' and the mode is 'RGBA', a white background is created and the image is pasted over it. Later, the image is converted to RGB. 
- However, this approach is incorrect, as converting RGBA to RGB without properly accounting for the alpha channel will produce incorrect color values, as observed in the test case.
- The incorrect color values are causing the test case to fail.

#### Suggested Fix:
- When converting an RGBA image to RGB, it is important to properly handle the alpha channel to maintain correct colors.
- One approach is to use the `alpha_composite` method to merge the RGBA image with a white background, ensuring that the alpha channel is considered during the conversion.
- After merging the images, convert the result to RGB.

#### Corrected Version:
```python
def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
    if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA':
        background = Image.new('RGBA', image.size, (255, 255, 255, 255))  # Include alpha channel in the background
        image = Image.alpha_composite(background, image).convert('RGB')  # Merge images considering alpha channel and convert to RGB
    elif image.mode != 'RGB':
        image = image.convert('RGB')

    if size:
        image = image.copy()
        image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)

    buf = BytesIO()
    image.save(buf, 'JPEG')
    return image, buf
```

By applying the suggested fix, the corrected function should now properly handle the RGBA to RGB conversion and pass the failing test case.
