The error message indicates that there is a discrepancy in the converted image's colors after performing the conversion. Specifically, the error occurs when the original image is in PNG format with RGBA mode and has transparency. The buggy function attempts to convert this image into an RGB mode without handling the transparency values correctly, resulting in a different set of colors.

To fix this bug, we need to properly handle the transparency channel when converting PNG images with RGBA mode to RGB mode. One approach could be to blend the image with a white background to preserve the transparency values before converting it to RGB.

Here is the corrected version of the `convert_image` function:

```python
from PIL import Image
from cStringIO import StringIO as BytesIO

def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
    if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA':
        background = Image.new('RGBA', image.size, (255, 255, 255, 255))  # White background with full transparency
        image = Image.alpha_composite(background, image)  # Blend background with original image
        image = image.convert('RGB')  # Convert to RGB mode
    elif image.mode != 'RGB':
        image = image.convert('RGB')
    
    if size:
        image = image.copy()
        image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)
    
    buf = BytesIO()
    image.save(buf, 'JPEG')
    return image, buf
```

By blending the original PNG RGBA image with a white background before converting it to RGB mode, we preserve the transparency values and avoid the color discrepancy issue. This updated function should now correctly handle PNG images with transparency during conversion and resolve the failing test case.
