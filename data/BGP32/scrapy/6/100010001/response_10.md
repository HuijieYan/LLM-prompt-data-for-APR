## Analysis:
The buggy function is intended to convert images to a specific format and size. The error occurs when the function is converting an RGBA image with PNG format to an RGB image. This operation fails to properly handle the alpha channel, resulting in an incorrect conversion.

## Potential Error:
The potential error lies in the section of code where it tries to handle RGBA images with PNG format.

## Cause of the Bug:
The bug occurs because when converting an RGBA image with PNG format to an RGB image, the alpha channel information is lost in the conversion process. This results in an incorrect color representation.

## Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix this bug, we need to correctly handle the alpha channel when converting RGBA images with PNG format to RGB images. One way to address this issue is to blend the RGBA image with a white background using the `alpha_composite` method before converting it to RGB.

## Corrected Version:
```python
def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
    if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA':
        background = Image.new('RGBA', image.size, (255, 255, 255, 255))
        background.paste(image, (0, 0), image)
        image = background.convert('RGB')
    elif image.mode != 'RGB':
        image = image.convert('RGB')

    if size:
        image = image.copy()
        image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)

    buf = BytesIO()
    image.save(buf, 'JPEG')
    return image, buf
```

With the corrected version above, the function should now properly handle the conversion of RGBA images with PNG format to RGB images, preserving the alpha channel information during the process. It should pass the failing test case provided.
