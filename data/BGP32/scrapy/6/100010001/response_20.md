### Analysis:
The buggy function has an issue with handling PNG images with transparency. The function checks if the image format is 'PNG' and the mode is 'RGBA', then it creates a new background with a white color and tries to paste the original image on it. However, the issue is that `image.paste()` is being called incorrectly, leading to unexpected results when the image has an alpha channel.

### Bug:
The root cause of the bug is in the line:
```python
background.paste(image, image)
```
When calling `background.paste(image, image)`, the image should only be pasted once to the background, not twice. In the RGBA mode, the second argument should be an image mask which is not properly handled in the current implementation.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
- Correct the `background.paste(image, image)` line to properly paste the image without specifying it as the mask. 
- Use the `paste` function correctly by specifying the transparency mask, if needed.

### Corrected Version:

```python
def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
    if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA':
        background = Image.new('RGBA', image.size, (255, 255, 255))
        background.paste(image, (0, 0), image)
        image = background.convert('RGB')
    elif image.mode != 'RGB':
        image = image.convert('RGB')

    if size:
        image = image.copy()
        image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)

    buf = BytesIO()
    image.save(buf, 'JPEG')
    return image, buf
```

With this corrected version, the buggy function should now properly handle PNG images with transparency.
