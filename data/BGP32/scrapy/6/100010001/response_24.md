### Analysis:
The buggy function `convert_image` is intended to convert images to the RGB mode and resize them if required. However, there seems to be a bug in the condition where it handles PNG images with RGBA mode. The logic for converting such images to RGB is incorrect, leading to differences in colors during the test.

### Potential Error Locations:
1. The condition for handling PNG images with RGBA mode.
2. The way the image is pasted onto a new background image.
3. The conversion logic from RGBA to RGB.

### Bug Cause:
The bug causes the function to incorrectly handle PNG images with RGBA mode by creating a white background image and pasting the original image on it. This results in loss of information about the transparency of the original image, affecting the color conversion process.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
1. Handle PNG images with RGBA mode differently by converting them directly to RGB without changing the background.
2. Update the logic for converting RGBA to RGB so that the transparency information is preserved.
3. Ensure the final RGB image maintains the original colors as closely as possible.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
    if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA':
        image = image.convert('RGB')
    elif image.mode != 'RGB':
        image = image.convert('RGB')

    if size:
        image = image.copy()
        image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)

    buf = BytesIO()
    image.save(buf, 'JPEG')
    return image, buf
```

By directly converting PNG images with RGBA mode to RGB mode without modifying the background, the bug can be fixed. This approach preserves the transparency information and ensures that the color conversion is accurate.
