## Analysis
The buggy function `convert_image` is expected to convert images to the desired format and size. The error message from the failing test indicates that the function is not converting images with transparency (RGBA) to the correct RGB color values. Specifically, the test is failing when converting an RGBA image to RGB.

## Potential Error Location
The potential error location in the function is when handling RGBA images with transparency and converting them to RGB format. The logic for this conversion seems to be incorrect, leading to the failed test.

## Cause of the Bug
The bug is caused by incorrectly converting RGBA images to RGB format without considering the transparency channel values. The conversion process is not correctly handling the transparency channel, leading to incorrect color values in the resulting RGB image.

## Strategy for Fixing the Bug
To fix the bug, the function should handle RGBA images with transparency correctly. Instead of blindly converting RGBA to RGB, the function should handle the transparency channel appropriately to preserve the intended color values.

## Corrected Version
```python
def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
    if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA':
        background = Image.new('RGBA', image.size, (255, 255, 255, 255))  # Added alpha value for background
        background.paste(image, image)
        image = background.convert('RGB')
    
    elif image.mode != 'RGB':
        image = image.convert('RGB')

    if size:
        image = image.copy()
        image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)

    buf = BytesIO()
    image.save(buf, 'JPEG')
    return image, buf
```

In the corrected version, when converting an RGBA image to RGB, the background is created with an alpha value of 255 (fully opaque white) before pasting the RGBA image onto it. This ensures that the transparency information is handled correctly during the conversion process.

By making this adjustment, the function should now correctly convert RGBA images to RGB without losing color information and passing the failing test described.
