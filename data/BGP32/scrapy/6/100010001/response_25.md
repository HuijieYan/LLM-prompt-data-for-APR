### Analysis:
The buggy function `convert_image` is supposed to convert images to the RGB format and save them as JPEG files. However, there is a bug in handling PNG images with RGBA mode, as seen from the failing test where the converted image did not match the expected result.

### Error:
The bug occurs when the function attempts to convert PNG images with RGBA mode by creating a new RGBA background image and attempting to paste the original image onto it. This results in incorrect color values in the converted image.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to handle PNG images with RGBA mode correctly. Instead of creating a new RGBA background image and pasting the original image, we should use the `convert` method in Pillow library to convert the RGBA image to RGB format directly.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
    if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA':
        # Convert RGBA images to RGB directly
        image = image.convert('RGB')
    elif image.mode != 'RGB':
        image = image.convert('RGB')

    if size:
        image = image.copy()
        image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)

    buf = BytesIO()
    image.save(buf, 'JPEG')
    return image, buf
```

By directly converting RGBA images to RGB format using the `.convert('RGB')` method, we ensure that the color values are correctly preserved during the conversion process, thus fixing the bug identified by the failing test.
