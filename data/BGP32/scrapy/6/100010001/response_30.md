### Analysis:
1. The function `convert_image` is responsible for converting images to a specific format and size.
2. The error message indicates a failure in the test case checking the converted colors after conversion.
3. The buggy function has a condition to handle PNG images with RGBA mode by converting them to RGB mode. However, in the test case, when an image with RGBA mode is converted, the colors don't match the expected result after conversion.
4. The bug might be due to the alpha channel not being properly handled while converting from RGBA to RGB mode.
5. To fix the bug, we need to modify the handling of PNG images with RGBA mode to properly handle the alpha channel.

### Strategy for fixing the bug:
1. Check if the image is in PNG format and RGBA mode.
2. If the above condition is met, create a new RGBA image filled with white color.
3. Paste the original image on top of the white background.
4. Convert the composite image to RGB mode, ensuring that transparent pixels are filled with white.
5. Finally, apply the thumbnail operation if required.
6. Update the test case to reflect the correct conversion of RGBA images.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
    if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA':
        background = Image.new('RGBA', image.size, (255, 255, 255, 255))  # Include alpha channel for white color
        background.paste(image, (0, 0), image)  # Paste the original image onto the white background
        image = background.convert('RGB')  # Convert to RGB, filling transparent areas with white
    elif image.mode != 'RGB':
        image = image.convert('RGB')

    if size:
        image = image.copy()
        image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)

    buf = BytesIO()
    image.save(buf, 'JPEG')
    return image, buf
```

Now, after applying the fix, the conversion of RGBA images to RGB mode will properly handle the alpha channel by filling transparent areas with white color. This should resolve the discrepancy in the test case and ensure the correct conversion of images.
