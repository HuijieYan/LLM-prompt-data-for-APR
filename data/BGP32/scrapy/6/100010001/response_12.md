### Analysis:
The error message indicates that the buggy function is not converting RGBA images with transparency correctly. The failing test is expecting the converted RGBA image to have a specific color (based on transparency), but the function is not converting it appropriately.

### Potential error locations:
1. The condition `if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA':` in the buggy function is not correctly handling RGBA images with transparency.
2. The conversion logic within the first `if` block might be incorrect.

### Cause of the bug:
The bug occurs because the current implementation of the function does not handle RGBA images with transparency accurately. When converting an image in RGBA mode with transparency to RGB, it should consider the alpha channel while preserving colors. The incorrect conversion leads to a mismatch in the expected and actual colors.

### Strategy for fixing the bug:
1. Modify the conversion logic for RGBA images with transparency to accurately convert them to RGB while preserving colors based on transparency.
2. Ensure that the conversion process maintains the expected color values even after the conversion.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
    if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA':
        background = Image.new('RGB', image.size, (255, 255, 255))
        background.paste(image, (0, 0), mask=image.split()[3])  # Consider the alpha channel while pasting
        image = background
    elif image.mode != 'RGB':
        image = image.convert('RGB')

    if size:
        image = image.copy()
        image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)

    buf = BytesIO()
    image.save(buf, 'JPEG')
    return image, buf
``` 

This corrected version correctly handles RGBA images with transparency during the conversion process, ensuring that the expected colors are maintained even after the conversion.
