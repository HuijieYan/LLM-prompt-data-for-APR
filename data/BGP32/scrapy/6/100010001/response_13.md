### Analysis:
1. The function `convert_image` is designed to convert images to the desired format and size.
2. The error message indicates that there is a mismatch in the expected color values after conversion in the `converted.getcolors()` assertion.
3. The error occurs specifically when trying to convert an RGBA image to RGB format. The buggy part is attempting to ignore transparency values in the conversion process.
4. The bug arises from the handling of transparent images in the RGBA to RGB conversion process.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
1. Check if the image has transparency and handle it appropriately when converting from RGBA to RGB.
2. Fill the transparent areas with white color before converting to RGB to maintain the intended color values.
3. Ensure that transparency is taken into account during the conversion process.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
    if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA':
        # Fill transparent areas with white color before converting to RGB
        background = Image.new('RGBA', image.size, (255, 255, 255, 255))
        background.paste(image, image)
        image = background.convert('RGB')
    elif image.mode != 'RGB':
        image = image.convert('RGB')

    if size:
        image_copy = image.copy()
        image_copy.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)
        image = image_copy

    buf = BytesIO()
    image.save(buf, 'JPEG')
    return image, buf
```

By modifying the `convert_image` function as shown above, the bug related to transparency handling during image conversion from RGBA to RGB should be fixed.
