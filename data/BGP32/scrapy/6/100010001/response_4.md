### Analysis:
- The error message indicates that the test is failing due to a discrepancy in the color values of the images.
- In the failing test scenario, the function encounters an issue related to RGBA format images when converting them to RGB.

### Bugs:
1. The bug arises in the condition that checks if the image format is PNG and the mode is RGBA.
2. If the image mode is RGBA and the format is PNG, the function creates a new white background image but incorrectly pastes the original image on it.

### Bug Cause:
- The bug is caused by the incorrect usage of the `paste` function, where the original image itself is used as the paste argument instead of its pixels. This results in an incorrect conversion of RGBA images to RGB.

### Fix Strategy:
- Instead of directly pasting the image, the pixels of the original RGBA image should be pasted onto the white background. This can be achieved by separating the channels of the original image and pasting them onto the background individually.

### Corrected Function:
```python
def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
    if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA':
        background = Image.new('RGBA', image.size, (255, 255, 255, 255))  # Include alpha channel in background
        background.paste(image, (0, 0), image)  # Paste image pixels onto background
        image = background.convert('RGB')  # Convert the resulting image to RGB
    elif image.mode != 'RGB':
        image = image.convert('RGB')

    if size:
        image = image.copy()
        image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)

    buf = BytesIO()
    image.save(buf, 'JPEG')
    return image, buf
```

By correcting the usage of the `paste` function in the PNG and RGBA conversion block, images with RGBA format and PNG format can be correctly converted to RGB format without losing any critical information in the process.
