## Error Analysis:
The error message indicates that the `converted` image does not match the expected colors after the conversion process. The failing test specifically identifies a case where an image with transparency (RGBA mode) is converted to RGB mode with a white background. The expected color values after this conversion are not being achieved, resulting in test failure.

## Bug Identification:
1. The function tries to convert RGBA images to RGB mode by creating a white background image and pasting the original RGBA image on top of it before converting to RGB mode. This process does not guarantee the correct conversion of colors, leading to the test failure.
2. The color values are not being handled correctly during the conversion process.
3. The comparison of color values after conversion is incorrect, leading to test failures.

## Bug Explanation:
The bug occurs because the conversion of RGBA images to RGB mode by pasting on a white background may not preserve the original color values accurately, leading to incorrect results and failing tests.

## Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the conversion from RGBA to RGB mode accurately preserves the original color values without affecting the transparency of the image. Additionally, we need to update the comparison logic to reflect the expected color values after the conversion process.

## Corrected Function:
```python
def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
    if image.mode == 'RGBA':
        image.load()
        background = Image.new("RGB", image.size, (255, 255, 255))
        background.paste(image, mask=image.split()[3])  # Paste the alpha channel of the image
        image = background

    if size:
        image = image.copy()
        image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)

    # Convert the image to RGB mode
    image = image.convert("RGB")

    buf = BytesIO()
    image.save(buf, 'JPEG')
    return image, buf
```

The corrected function handles the RGBA to RGB conversion by loading the image, creating a white background with the alpha channel from the original image, and then pasting the image onto the background. This process ensures that the transparency of the original image is preserved while converting it to RGB mode. Additionally, it correctly converts the image to RGB format before saving and returning the result.

This corrected version should pass the failing test by accurately preserving the color values during the conversion process.
