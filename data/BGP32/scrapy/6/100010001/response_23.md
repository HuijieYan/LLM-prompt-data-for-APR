### Analysis:
1. The error message indicates that the converted image is not matching the expected color values.
2. The failing test cases are related to images with transparency which leads to discrepancies in the converted colors.
3. The `convert_image` function in the buggy code may have issues handling transparency.
4. The code assumes that all transparent images should have a white background which may not be the correct approach for preserving transparency.

### Bug Cause:
- The bug is likely caused by the way transparent images with an alpha channel are handled in the `convert_image` function.
- When encountering an RGBA image format with a PNG format, the code creates a new image with a white background which may remove the transparency.
- This results in the final converted image having altered colors and loss of transparency.

### Fix Strategy:
- Check if the image has transparency before creating a new image with a white background to preserve it.
- Modify the handling of transparent images to retain the transparency when converting to RGB format.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
    if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA':
        if image.getchannel('A').getextrema()[1] < 255:  # Check if there is any transparency
            background = Image.new('RGBA', image.size, (255, 255, 255, 255))
            background.paste(image, image)
            image = background.convert('RGB')
    elif image.mode != 'RGB':
        image = image.convert('RGB')

    if size:
        image = image.copy()
        image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)

    buf = BytesIO()
    image.save(buf, 'JPEG')
    return image, buf
```

### Summary:
- The corrected version of the function now checks for transparency in RGBA images before converting them to RGB format.
- This change ensures that images with transparency are handled correctly and their colors are preserved during conversion.
