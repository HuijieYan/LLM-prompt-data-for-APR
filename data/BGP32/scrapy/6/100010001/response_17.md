### Analysis:
The error message indicates that the function is not correctly converting PNG images with RGBA mode to RGB mode. The expected result is not matching the actual result, leading to a test failure. The issue seems to be in the portion of the function that handles PNG images with RGBA mode.

### Issues:
1. The conditional check for handling RGBA mode is not functioning correctly.
2. The conversion of RGBA PNG images to RGB is not effective.

### Cause of the Bug:
The bug arises due to incorrect logic in converting PNG images with RGBA mode to RGB mode. The condition for this conversion is not properly handling the background and pasting operations.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To resolve the bug, ensure that when dealing with PNG images in RGBA mode, a proper background is created, and then the image is pasted onto it before converting it to RGB mode. Additionally, ensure that the conversion from RGBA to RGB is correctly handled.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
    if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA':
        background = Image.new('RGBA', image.size, (255, 255, 255, 255))  # RGBA background
        background.paste(image, (0, 0))  # Paste image on background properly
        image = background.convert('RGB')
    elif image.mode != 'RGB':
        image = image.convert('RGB')

    if size:
        image = image.copy()
        image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)

    buf = BytesIO()
    image.save(buf, 'JPEG')
    return image, buf
```

By correcting the background creation and pasting operations for RGBA PNG images and updating the conversion logic, this corrected function should now properly handle PNG images with RGBA mode, resolving the bug.
