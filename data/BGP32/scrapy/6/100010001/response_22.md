### Analysis:
The error message indicates that the `getcolors()` method is returning incorrect values for the converted image, leading to a test failure. The test is expecting a specific color value, but the converted image is not matching that value.

### Error Location:
The issue lies in the logic used for converting images with transparency (format == 'PNG' and mode == 'RGBA'). The current logic replaces the alpha channel with a white background, but it should be retaining the alpha channel for transparency preservation.

### Bug Cause:
The bug arises from the loss of transparency information when converting RGBA images to RGB. The current code pastes the RGBA image on a white background, resulting in the loss of the alpha channel information.

### Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to modify the logic for handling RGBA images. Instead of pasting the image on a white background, we should create a new RGBA image with the same size and paste the original image on it. This way, the transparency information will be preserved during the conversion.

### Corrected Function:
```python
def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
    if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA':
        # Create a new RGBA image with the same size
        converted_image = Image.new('RGBA', image.size, (255, 255, 255, 255))
        converted_image.paste(image, (0, 0), image)
        image = converted_image.convert('RGB')
    elif image.mode != 'RGB':
        image = image.convert('RGB')

    if size:
        image = image.copy()
        image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)

    buf = BytesIO()
    image.save(buf, 'JPEG')
    return image, buf
```

By pasting the original RGBA image onto a new RGBA background image and then converting it to RGB, we ensure that the transparency information is retained during the conversion. This corrected version should pass the failing test case mentioned in the error message.
