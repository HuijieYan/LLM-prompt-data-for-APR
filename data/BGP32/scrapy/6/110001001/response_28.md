### Bug Explanation
The bug in the `convert_image` function arises because it fails to handle images with mode 'P' correctly. In the provided buggy function, there is a check for PNG images with RGBA mode to convert them to RGB, but there is no specific check or conversion for images with mode 'P' (palette mode), leading to unexpected behavior and incorrect image conversions in certain cases.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to add a specific check and conversion logic for images with mode 'P' (palette mode) before the general conversion to RGB. This will ensure that images with 'P' mode are correctly handled and converted. We can use the `.convert()` method with the 'RGB' mode for images with mode 'P'.

### Corrected Function
Here is the corrected version of the `convert_image` function:

```python
def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
    if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA':
        background = Image.new('RGBA', image.size, (255, 255, 255))
        background.paste(image, image)
        image = background.convert('RGB')
    elif image.mode == 'P':
        image = image.convert('RGB')

    if size:
        image = image.copy()
        image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)

    buf = BytesIO()
    image.save(buf, 'JPEG')
    return image, buf
```

With this correction, images with mode 'P' will now be converted to RGB before further processing, ensuring that the function handles all types of images correctly.
