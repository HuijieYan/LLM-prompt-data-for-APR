### Explanation of the bug
The bug in the `convert_image` function is related to the conditional check on the image format and mode. The function is checking if the image format is 'PNG' and the mode is 'RGBA', and then trying to convert the image to 'RGB'. However, in some cases, the image may have a different mode ('P' in Case 4) which is not being handled properly, leading to incorrect conversions. Additionally, the `paste` method for creating the background image in the RGB format is not used correctly.

### Strategy for fixing the bug
1. Update the conditional check to handle cases where the image format is not 'PNG' or the image mode is not 'RGBA'.
2. Fix the usage of the `paste` method to create a background image with the correct RGBA mode.

### Corrected version of the function
```python
def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
    if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA':
        background = Image.new('RGBA', image.size, (255, 255, 255))
        background.paste(image, (0, 0))
        image = background.convert('RGB')
    elif image.mode != 'RGB':
        image = image.convert('RGB')

    if size:
        image = image.copy()
        image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)

    buf = BytesIO()
    image.save(buf, 'JPEG')
    return image, buf
``` 

By applying the above corrections, the `convert_image` function should now handle different image modes and formats correctly and prevent unexpected conversions.
