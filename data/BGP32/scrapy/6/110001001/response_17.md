### Potential Error Locations
1. The condition `if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA':` checks for the image format and mode, but it uses a case-sensitive comparison which might not be reliable.
2. The code that converts the image to RGB mode might not handle all cases properly, especially if the initial image mode is not RGB.
3. The thumbnail generation process might encounter issues if the size parameter is not correctly handled or the Image.ANTIALIAS mode is causing unexpected behavior.
4. The saving process as a JPEG might not be appropriate for all input cases.

### Cause of the Bug
1. The bug arises from not handling all possible image formats and modes properly.
2. The function does not have a robust conversion mechanism to ensure the output image is consistently in the correct mode and format.
3. Inadequate handling of the size parameter or the thumbnail generation process could result in unexpected image outputs.
4. Saving the image as JPEG without considering the input format could lead to loss of information or incorrect file types.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug
1. Use case-insensitive checks for image format and mode comparisons.
2. Implement a more comprehensive conversion process that accounts for all image modes and formats.
3. Ensure proper handling of the size parameter and thumbnail generation.
4. Dynamically determine the output file format based on the input image format to avoid lossy conversions.

### Corrected Version of the Function
```python
def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
    if image.format.upper() == 'PNG' and image.mode.upper() == 'RGBA':
        background = Image.new('RGBA', image.size, (255, 255, 255))
        background.paste(image, image)
        image = background.convert('RGB')
    elif image.mode != 'RGB':
        image = image.convert('RGB')

    if size:
        image = image.copy()
        image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)

    buf = BytesIO()
    if image.format:
        format = image.format
    else:
        format = 'JPEG'
    image.save(buf, format)
    return image, buf
``` 

In the corrected version, we've made the following changes:
- Used `image.format.upper()` and `image.mode.upper()` for case-insensitive comparisons.
- Added a conditional to determine the output image format dynamically.
- Ensured a more robust conversion process for handling different image modes and formats.
- Considered the input image format when saving the image to avoid data loss.
