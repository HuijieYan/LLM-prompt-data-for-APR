### Analysis
The buggy function `convert_image` in the `ImagesPipeline` class is supposed to handle image conversion and resizing. There are several issues in the function:
1. The condition to convert 'RGBA' PNG images to 'RGB' images seems incorrect, as it is currently checking if the image format is 'PNG' and mode is 'RGBA' together, which is not always the case.
2. The line where the background image is pasted onto itself is likely incorrect and may cause unexpected behavior.
3. The decision to always save the image in 'JPEG' format without considering the original format may lead to loss of image data.
4. The code could be improved for better performance and readability.

### Bug Cause
The bug arises from the incorrect condition for handling 'RGBA' PNG images and the incorrect use of the `paste` method.

### Strategy for Fixing
1. Refactor the condition to handle 'RGBA' PNG images correctly.
2. Use the `paste` method correctly to avoid issues.
3. Consider the original image format when saving the image.
4. Improve the code structure for better readability and maintainability.

### Corrected Version
```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: scrapy/pipelines/images.py

# The declaration of the class containing the corrected function
class ImagesPipeline(FilesPipeline):
    """
    Abstract pipeline that implement the image thumbnail generation logic
    
        
    """

    def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
        if image.mode == 'RGBA':
            background = Image.new('RGB', image.size, (255, 255, 255))
            background.paste(image, (0, 0), image)
            image = background.convert('RGB')
        elif image.mode != 'RGB':
            image = image.convert('RGB')
    
        if size:
            image = image.copy()
            image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)
    
        buf = BytesIO()
        image.save(buf, image.format)
        return image, buf
```

In the corrected version:
1. The condition to handle 'RGBA' PNG images is corrected to check only the image mode.
2. The `paste` method is used correctly by providing the position.
3. The original image format is used when saving the image to avoid loss of data.
4. The code structure is improved for better readability and maintainability.
