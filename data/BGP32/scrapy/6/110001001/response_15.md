### Analysis
1. The `convert_image` function is designed to take an image and optionally a size parameter, convert the image to RGB mode if needed, create a thumbnail if a size is provided, save the image as a JPEG format, and return the modified image and a buffer.
   
2. The buggy function has a conditional check for PNG format images with RGBA mode that converts them to RGB mode with a white background. There seems to be an issue with how the image is pasted onto the background.

3. In Case 1 and Case 2, the image is already in RGB mode, so the conditional convert block is unnecessary and might cause an issue with image conversion.

4. The bug might occur due to the faulty logic of pasting the image onto the background in the PNG to RGB conversion block. This could result in the image not being correctly converted and saved.

### Bug Fix
Refactor the function to remove unnecessary conversion blocks for images already in RGB mode. Fix the PNG to RGB conversion by pasting the image onto the background properly and then converting to RGB. Ensure that the thumbnail creation and image save process are functioning correctly.

### Corrected Function
```python
def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
    if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA':
        background = Image.new('RGBA', image.size, (255, 255, 255))
        background.paste(image, (0, 0, image.size[0], image.size[1]))
        image = background.convert('RGB')
    elif image.mode != 'RGB':
        image = image.convert('RGB')

    if size:
        image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)

    buf = BytesIO()
    image.save(buf, 'JPEG')
    return image, buf
```

This corrected version includes a fix for the paste operation within the PNG to RGB conversion block and ensures that the function correctly handles different image modes and sizes without unnecessary conversions.
