### Explanation:
The buggy function `convert_image` is intended to handle image conversion and resizing. However, there are a few issues causing it to not function correctly:
1. The condition for checking if the format of the image is 'PNG' and mode is 'RGBA' is incorrect. It should check if the format is 'PNG' and the mode is 'RGBA', not just the mode.
2. When creating a new background image, the `paste` method is used incorrectly. It should be `background.paste(image, (0, 0))` to paste the image onto the background correctly.
3. Saving the image to JPEG format without considering its original format might cause unexpected behavior.

### Strategy for fixing the bug:
1. Correct the condition for checking the image format and mode.
2. Fix the usage of the `paste` method to correctly paste the image onto the background.
3. Consider the original image format when saving the image.

### Corrected version of the function:
```python
def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
    if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA':
        background = Image.new('RGBA', image.size, (255, 255, 255))
        background.paste(image, (0, 0))
        image = background.convert('RGB')
    elif image.mode != 'RGB':
        image = image.convert('RGB')

    if size:
        image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)

    buf = BytesIO()
    
    # Save the image based on its original format
    if image.format == 'PNG':
        image.save(buf, 'PNG')
    else:
        image.save(buf, 'JPEG')
    
    return image, buf
``` 

This corrected version of the function includes fixes for the identified issues and should now work properly based on the provided test cases.
