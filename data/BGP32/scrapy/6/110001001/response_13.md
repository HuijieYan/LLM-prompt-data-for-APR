### Explanation:
The bug in the `convert_image` function lies in the conditional check where the image format is compared to 'PNG' in uppercase. The condition checks for 'PNG' while in the runtime values, the image format is 'JPEG' or other formats. It leads to the bug where the code inside the conditional block is executed incorrectly even when it should not.

Additionally, in the conditional block where the mode is checked, the logic to copy and thumbnail the image is missing. This can lead to unexpected behavior when converting the images to RGB.

### Strategy for fixing the bug:
1. Correct the conditional check for the image format comparison to 'PNG' in uppercase.
2. Ensure that all necessary logic for copying and thumbnailing the image is implemented in all appropriate branches of the conditional statements.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
    if image.format.upper() == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA':
        background = Image.new('RGBA', image.size, (255, 255, 255))
        background.paste(image, (0, 0), image)
        image = background.convert('RGB')
    elif image.mode != 'RGB':
        image = image.convert('RGB')

    if size:
        image_thumbnail = image.copy()
        image_thumbnail.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)
        image = image_thumbnail

    buf = BytesIO()
    image.save(buf, 'JPEG')
    return image, buf
``` 

By making the corrections above, the function should now correctly handle images with different formats and modes, ensuring that image conversion and thumbnailing operations are performed appropriately based on the input image details.
