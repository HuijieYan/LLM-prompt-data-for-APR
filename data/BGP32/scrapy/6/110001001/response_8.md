### Explanation:
The buggy function `convert_image` is designed to handle image conversions and thumbnail generation. However, there are a few issues:
1. In the first condition, it checks if the image format is `'PNG'` and the mode is `'RGBA'`, but it attempts to convert the image to `'RGB'` without converting it from `'RGBA'` first.
2. In the second condition, it converts the image to `'RGB'` if it is not already in that mode, but it doesn't handle the case where the image is in a different mode like `'P'`.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Ensure that when the image format is `'PNG'` and mode is `'RGBA'`, it is first converted to a background with white color before converting it to `'RGB'`.
2. Handle the case where the image mode is not `'RGB'` but different for proper conversion.

### Corrected Version:

```python
def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
    if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA':
        background = Image.new('RGBA', image.size, (255, 255, 255))
        background.paste(image, (0, 0), image)
        image = background.convert('RGB')
    elif image.mode != 'RGB':
        image = image.convert('RGB')

    if size:
        image = image.copy()
        image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)

    buf = BytesIO()
    image.save(buf, 'JPEG')
    return image, buf
``` 

In this corrected version, we fixed the conversion logic by pasting the image onto a white background before converting to `'RGB'` to ensure that image modes are handled correctly.
