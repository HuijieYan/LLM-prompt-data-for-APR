### Bug Explanation

The bug in the function `convert_image` arises from the conditional check on the image format and mode. If the image format is 'PNG' and mode is 'RGBA', the function attempts to create a new image with a white background and paste the original image on top. However, the paste operation is incorrect as it's passed the image itself instead of the image content. This results in the image not being properly placed on the white background.

### Bug Fix Strategy

To fix the bug, we need to correct the paste operation to pass the image content instead of the image object itself. Additionally, we need to handle the case when the image format is 'PNG' and mode is 'RGBA' appropriately.

### Corrected Version

```python
def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
    if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA':
        background = Image.new('RGBA', image.size, (255, 255, 255))
        background.paste(image, (0, 0), image)
        image = background.convert('RGB')
    elif image.mode != 'RGB':
        image = image.convert('RGB')

    if size:
        image = image.copy()
        image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)

    buf = BytesIO()
    image.save(buf, 'JPEG')
    return image, buf
```

In the corrected version, the `paste` method is called with the correct parameters to paste the image content onto the white background. This ensures that the images are processed correctly based on their formats and modes.
