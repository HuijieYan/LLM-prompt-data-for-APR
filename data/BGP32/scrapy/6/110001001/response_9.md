### Analysis:
The buggy function `convert_image` aims to process an input image according to its format and mode. It first checks if the image is in PNG format and RGBA mode, in which case it converts the image to RGB format after adding a white background. If the image is not in RGB mode, it converts it to RGB. Then, it applies resizing if a `size` parameter is provided and saves the image in JPEG format using a `BytesIO` buffer.

### Issues:
1. The conversion check in the first conditional statement is incorrect. The condition should be checking for PNG format and not JPEG.
2. The usage of the `paste` method in the RGBA to RGB conversion is incorrect. It should be pasting the image on the background.
3. The `thumbnail` method used for resizing the image should resize the image in place and not return a new image.
4. The image format for saving should be determined based on the image format itself.

### Bug Fix:
Here is the corrected version of the `convert_image` function:

```python
def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
    if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA':
        background = Image.new('RGBA', image.size, (255, 255, 255))
        background.paste(image, (0, 0), image)
        image = background.convert('RGB')
    elif image.mode != 'RGB':
        image = image.convert('RGB')

    if size:
        image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)

    buf = BytesIO()
    image.save(buf, image.format)
    return image, buf
```

By making the corrections described above, the function should now work correctly for the provided test cases.
