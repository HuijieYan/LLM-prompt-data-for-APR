## Analysis:
1. The `convert_image` function is supposed to convert images to RGB format and resize them if a custom size is provided.
2. The potential error locations are the conditions for checking image format and mode, and the resizing of the image.
3. The bug occurs when the function incorrectly handles images in RGBA format by not properly converting them to RGB. This leads to incorrect results in the test cases that involve images in RGBA format.
4. To fix the bug, we need to correctly convert images in RGBA format to RGB before resizing them. We also need to handle PNG images with transparency properly.

## Corrected Version:
```python
def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
    if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA':
        background = Image.new('RGB', image.size, (255, 255, 255))
        background.paste(image, (0, 0), image)
        image = background
    elif image.mode != 'RGB':
        image = image.convert('RGB')

    if size:
        image = image.copy()
        image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)

    buf = BytesIO()
    image.save(buf, 'JPEG')
    return image, buf
```

By correcting the `convert_image` function to properly handle images in RGBA format and PNG images with transparency, the function should now pass all the test cases provided.
