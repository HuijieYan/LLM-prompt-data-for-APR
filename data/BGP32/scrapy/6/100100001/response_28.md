## Analysis:
1. The `convert_image` function is intended to convert images to RGB and resize them if a size is provided.
2. The function has conditional blocks to handle different image formats and modes.
3. However, the bug seems to be in the condition where the image format is 'PNG' and the mode is 'RGBA'.
4. The bug is likely due to the incorrect usage of the `paste` method when creating a new image with a white background.
5. The failing test is for the case when the input image has format 'PNG' and mode 'RGBA'.

## Bug Cause:
The bug is caused by the incorrect usage of the `paste` method in the condition where the image format is 'PNG' and the mode is 'RGBA'. The `paste` method takes the image to be pasted as the first argument, and the second argument specifies the box (coordinates) where the image should be pasted. In this case, passing `image` as both arguments to `paste` is incorrect and leads to unexpected behavior.

## Fix Strategy:
1. In the case where the image format is 'PNG' and mode is 'RGBA', we need to create a new image with a white background and then paste the original image onto the background.
2. After pasting, we should convert the image to 'RGB' mode to ensure consistency.

## Corrected Function:
```python
def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
    if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA':
        background = Image.new('RGB', image.size, (255, 255, 255))
        background.paste(image, (0, 0), image)
        image = background
    elif image.mode != 'RGB':
        image = image.convert('RGB')

    if size:
        image = image.copy()
        image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)

    buf = BytesIO()
    image.save(buf, 'JPEG')
    return image, buf
```

By correcting the `paste` method usage and ensuring proper handling of the image conversions, the corrected version of the `convert_image` function should now pass the failing test case.
