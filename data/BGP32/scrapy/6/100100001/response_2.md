## Analysis:
The buggy function `convert_image` is responsible for converting images to a specific format and size. The bug seems to be related to the handling of images with the format 'PNG' and mode 'RGBA'. The function attempts to convert such images to 'RGB', but the implementation of pasting the image onto a new 'RGBA' background before conversion seems incorrect.

## Identifying potential error locations:
1. The code snippet `background.paste(image, image)` seems incorrect as it should paste the input image onto the new 'RGBA' background image.
2. The logic for converting images with format 'PNG' and mode 'RGBA' might be flawed.

## Explanation of the bug:
The bug arises when trying to convert 'PNG' images with mode 'RGBA' to 'RGB'. The implementation of pasting the image onto a new background before conversion leads to incorrect handling of transparency in the image.

## Strategy for fixing the bug:
1. Instead of pasting the image onto itself, paste it onto the newly created background.
2. Ensure that the transparency in the image is properly handled during conversion from 'RGBA' to 'RGB'.

## Corrected version of the function:
```python
def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
    if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA':
        background = Image.new('RGBA', image.size, (255, 255, 255, 255))
        background.paste(image, (0, 0), image)
        image = background.convert('RGB')
    elif image.mode != 'RGB':
        image = image.convert('RGB')

    if size:
        image = image.copy()
        image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)

    buf = BytesIO()
    image.save(buf, 'JPEG')
    return image, buf
```

By correctly pasting the image onto the new background and ensuring proper handling of transparency during the conversion process, the corrected function should now pass the failing test case.
