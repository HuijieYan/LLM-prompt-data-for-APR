## Analysis:
The buggy function `convert_image` is designed to convert an image to a certain format (RGB) and size (if specified) before saving it as a JPEG image. However, there are a few potential error locations:
1. In the conditional check for PNG format and RGBA mode, the code attempts to create a new RGBA image with a white background and paste the original image onto it. However, the correct way should be to paste the original image onto the new image with the white background.
2. There might be an issue with the logic for handling different image modes and conversions.

## Bug Cause:
The bug occurs when attempting to convert an image with PNG format and RGBA mode to RGB. The function incorrectly pastes the image onto a new RGBA background instead of a white RGB background. This results in the incorrect conversion of the image.

## Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
1. Paste the original image onto a new RGB background when converting a PNG image with RGBA mode.
2. Adjust the logic for handling different image modes and conversions to ensure correct conversion and thumbnailing.

## Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
    if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA':
        background = Image.new('RGB', image.size, (255, 255, 255))
        background.paste(image, (0, 0), image)
        image = background
    elif image.mode != 'RGB':
        image = image.convert('RGB')

    if size:
        image = image.copy()
        image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)

    buf = BytesIO()
    image.save(buf, 'JPEG')
    return image, buf
```

By making the corrections mentioned above, the function should now correctly handle the conversion of images to RGB format and the creation of thumbnails.
