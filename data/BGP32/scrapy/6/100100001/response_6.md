## Analysis:
- The `convert_image` function is responsible for converting images to a specific format (JPEG) and resizing them if required.
- The bug seems to be related to handling images with transparency (RGBA) when the format is PNG.

## Bug Explanation:
- The bug occurs when the image format is PNG and the mode is RGBA. In this case, the function creates a new RGBA background image filled with white and pastes the original image on top of it. However, the `paste` method is being passed the image object instead of the image data, causing the error.

## Bug Fix Strategy:
- To fix the bug, we need to pass the image data instead of the image object to the `paste` method when creating a new background image for RGBA images.

## Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
    if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA':
        background = Image.new('RGBA', image.size, (255, 255, 255))
        background.paste(image, (0, 0), image)
        image = background.convert('RGB')
    elif image.mode != 'RGB':
        image = image.convert('RGB')

    if size:
        image = image.copy()
        image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)

    buf = BytesIO()
    image.save(buf, 'JPEG')
    return image, buf
```

By modifying the `paste` method in the RGBA case to pass the image data `(0, 0), image)` instead of the image object `image`, the bug should be fixed.
