The bug in the `convert_image` function lies in the condition where the image format is PNG and mode is RGBA. The code attempts to create a white background image with RGBA mode, paste the original image onto it, and then convert it to RGB mode. However, the `paste` method expects a tuple for the `box` parameter, representing the position where the image should be pasted. The correct way to paste the image onto the background is to provide the `(0, 0)` tuple as the position.

To fix the bug, the `background.paste(image, (0, 0))` line should be corrected. Once this fix is applied, the function should be able to handle PNG images with RGBA mode properly.

Here is the corrected version of the `convert_image` function:

```python
def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
    if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA':
        background = Image.new('RGBA', image.size, (255, 255, 255))
        background.paste(image, (0, 0))  # Corrected line
        image = background.convert('RGB')
    elif image.mode != 'RGB':
        image = image.convert('RGB')

    if size:
        image = image.copy()
        image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)

    buf = BytesIO()
    image.save(buf, 'JPEG')
    return image, buf
```

With this correction, the buggy function should now correctly handle PNG images with RGBA mode and pass the failing test scenario related to this case.
