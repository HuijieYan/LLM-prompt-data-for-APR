### Analysis
The buggy function `convert_image` is supposed to handle converting images to a specific format and size. However, there are potential errors in the function related to handling images with transparency and PNG format.

### Bug Explanation
The bug arises when the function encounters an image with PNG format and RGBA mode. In such cases, the function attempts to create a new RGBA background and paste the image on it, followed by converting it to RGB format. The bug lies in the line:
```python
background.paste(image, image)
```
This line of code incorrectly pastes the image onto itself, resulting in the loss of the original image data and causing unexpected behavior in the conversion process.

### Fix Strategy
To fix this bug, we need to correct the image pasting logic when handling images with PNG format and RGBA mode. We should create a new RGBA background and paste the original image onto this background instead of pasting it onto itself.

### Corrected Version
Here is the corrected version of the `convert_image` function:

```python
def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
    if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA':
        background = Image.new('RGBA', image.size, (255, 255, 255))
        background.paste(image, (0, 0), image)
        image = background.convert('RGB')
    elif image.mode != 'RGB':
        image = image.convert('RGB')

    if size:
        image = image.copy()
        image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)

    buf = BytesIO()
    image.save(buf, 'JPEG')
    return image, buf
```

By correcting the image pasting logic within the function, it should now handle images with PNG format and RGBA mode correctly and pass the failing test provided.
