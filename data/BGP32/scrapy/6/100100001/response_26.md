The bug in the provided function `convert_image` lies in the condition `if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA'` where it attempts to handle PNG images with RGBA mode incorrectly. The mistake occurs in the line `background.paste(image, image)`, where the `image` object is used twice as the source image for the `paste` method, resulting in an incorrect composition.

To fix this bug, we need to correctly paste the source image onto the background image. We can achieve this by using the correct arguments for the `paste` method. 

Here is the corrected version of the `convert_image` function:

```python
def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
    if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA':
        background = Image.new('RGBA', image.size, (255, 255, 255))
        background.paste(image, (0, 0), image)
        image = background.convert('RGB')
    elif image.mode != 'RGB':
        image = image.convert('RGB')

    if size:
        image = image.copy()
        image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)

    buf = BytesIO()
    image.save(buf, 'JPEG')
    return image, buf
```

In this corrected version, the `paste` method now takes three arguments: the image to paste, the position (here `(0, 0)` to paste at the top-left corner), and the image to be pasted. This ensures that the images are correctly composed, resolving the bug.

Now, the provided test should pass with this corrected version of the `convert_image` function.
