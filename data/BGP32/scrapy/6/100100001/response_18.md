The bug in the `convert_image` function lies in the handling of images with an RGBA mode and PNG format. In the current implementation, when the input image has format 'PNG' and mode 'RGBA', the function creates a new RGBA background image filled with white color, pastes the original image on top of it, and then converts it to RGB. The bug occurs during the pasting step where the function mistakenly pastes the original image on top of itself.

To fix this bug, we need to correct the `paste` method call to paste the original image onto the background image properly.

Here is the corrected version of the `convert_image` function:

```python
# The corrected version of the buggy function
def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
    if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA':
        background = Image.new('RGBA', image.size, (255, 255, 255))
        background.paste(image, (0, 0), image)
        image = background.convert('RGB')
    elif image.mode != 'RGB':
        image = image.convert('RGB')

    if size:
        image = image.copy()
        image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)

    buf = BytesIO()
    image.save(buf, 'JPEG')
    return image, buf
```

With this correction in place, the `convert_image` function will correctly handle images with RGBA mode and PNG format, ensuring that the pasting operation is done properly.

After applying this fix and running the failing test, it should now pass without any issues.
