### Analysis:
The buggy function `convert_image` has several potential error locations:
1. In the condition `if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA'`, the logic seems to be incorrect as it is checking if the image format is PNG and mode is RGBA, but then it is creating a new RGBA image.
2. The line `background.paste(image, image)` seems to be incorrect, as it expects a box argument for pasting, not the `image` itself.
3. The function saves the image as JPEG format regardless of its original format, which might cause issues when trying to convert PNG images with transparency.

### Cause of the Bug:
The bug in the `convert_image` function arises from the incorrect handling of PNG images with RGBA mode. The function does not handle the transparency channel properly, leading to the loss of transparency when converting PNG images to JPEG.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to properly handle PNG images with RGBA mode and preserve the transparency channel during conversion. This can be achieved by creating a new RGBA image first, pasting the original image on top to preserve transparency, and then converting it to RGB before resizing.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
    if image.mode == 'RGBA':
        background = Image.new('RGBA', image.size, (255, 255, 255, 255))
        background.paste(image, (0, 0), image)
        image = background.convert('RGB')
    elif image.mode != 'RGB':
        image = image.convert('RGB')

    if size:
        image = image.copy()
        image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)

    buf = BytesIO()
    if image.format:
        # Preserve the original image format
        image.save(buf, image.format)
    else:
        # Default to JPEG if no format is available
        image.save(buf, 'JPEG')
    
    return image, buf
```

With the corrected version of the function, it properly handles PNG images with RGBA mode, preserves transparency during conversion, and saves the image in its original format if available. This fix should make the function pass the failing test.
