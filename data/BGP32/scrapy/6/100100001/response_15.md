## Analysis:
- The `convert_image` function is responsible for converting images to a specified format and size.
- The bug likely stems from the incorrect handling of images with format 'PNG' and mode 'RGBA'.
- The bug can cause incorrect conversion from RGBA to RGB, resulting in unexpected output.

## Bug Explanation:
- In the buggy function, there is a conditional check for images with format 'PNG' and mode 'RGBA'.
- When encountering this condition, a new image 'background' is created with mode 'RGBA' and pasted with the original image.
- However, the paste operation is incorrect `background.paste(image, image)` which results in the original image being pasted at an incorrect location, leading to the conversion issue.
- This incorrect operation undermines the correct conversion of images from RGBA to RGB.

## Bug Fix Strategy:
- Correct the paste operation to ensure the RGBA image is correctly pasted over the background.
- Ensure that the correct conversion logic is applied based on the image format and mode.

## Correction:

```python
def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
    if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA':
        background = Image.new('RGBA', image.size, (255, 255, 255))
        background.paste(image, (0, 0), image)
        image = background.convert('RGB')
    elif image.mode != 'RGB':
        image = image.convert('RGB')

    if size:
        image = image.copy()
        image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)

    buf = BytesIO()
    image.save(buf, 'JPEG')
    return image, buf
```

By correcting the paste operation `background.paste(image, (0, 0), image)`, the function should now correctly convert images with format 'PNG' and mode 'RGBA' to RGB format. This correction aims to address the bug and ensure the function passes the failing test.
