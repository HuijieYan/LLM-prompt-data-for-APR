### Analysis:
The buggy function `convert_image` is responsible for converting images to RGB format and JPEG format. The function checks if the image format is PNG and mode is RGBA, then converts it to RGB mode. It also converts images to RGB mode if they are not already in RGB. Additionally, it resizes the image if a size parameter is provided.

### Potential error locations:
1. The condition `if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA':` might not properly handle the case of transparency in PNG images.
2. The line `background.paste(image, image)` might not be the correct way to paste the image onto the background.
3. The resizing logic in `image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)` could potentially have issues with maintaining aspect ratio and sizing.

### Explanation of the bug:
The bug is likely related to the incorrect handling of transparency in PNG images. When the function tries to convert a PNG image with RGBA mode to RGB, it might not properly handle the transparency information, leading to incorrect color values. This results in the failing test where the mode or colors of the converted image do not match the expected values.

### Fixing the bug:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that transparency in PNG images is properly handled during conversion to RGB. It might involve creating a new RGBA image with a solid background before conversion.

### Corrected version of the function:
```python
def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
    if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA':
        background = Image.new('RGBA', image.size, (255, 255, 255, 255))
        background.paste(image, (0, 0), image)
        image = background.convert('RGB')
    elif image.mode != 'RGB':
        image = image.convert('RGB')
        
    if size:
        image = image.copy()
        image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)
        
    buf = BytesIO()
    image.save(buf, 'JPEG')
    return image, buf
```

With the corrected version of the function that properly handles transparency during conversion, the failing test should pass successfully.
