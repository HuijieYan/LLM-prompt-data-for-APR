### Bug Explanation
The bug occurs when the input image is in PNG format with RGBA mode. In this case, the function attempts to convert the image to RGB mode, but it doesn't properly handle the transparency channel, which causes incorrect color values.

Specifically, the buggy part is in the condition where the image format is PNG and the mode is RGBA. The function creates a new background image with a white color and pastes the original image on top of it. However, the `paste` method should not be `background.paste(image, image)` but `background.paste(image, (0, 0), image)`. This results in the original image being pasted over itself, leading to a loss of transparency information.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that when the input image is in PNG format with RGBA mode, the transparency information is preserved during the conversion process. This can be achieved by using the correct parameters for the `paste` method to retain the alpha channel.

### Corrected Version of the Function
```python
def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
    if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA':
        background = Image.new('RGBA', image.size, (255, 255, 255, 255))
        background.paste(image, (0, 0), image)
        image = background.convert('RGB')
    elif image.mode != 'RGB':
        image = image.convert('RGB')

    if size:
        image = image.copy()
        image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)

    buf = BytesIO()
    image.save(buf, 'JPEG')
    return image, buf
```

By making the described change in how the image is pasted onto the background in the PNG RGBA case, the corrected function will preserve the alpha channel during the conversion, resolving the bug.
