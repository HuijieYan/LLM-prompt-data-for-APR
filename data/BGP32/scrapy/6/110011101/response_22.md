### Bug Analysis
1. The buggy function is intended to convert an input image to a specific format and thumbnail size if required. However, there are issues with handling PNG images in RGBA mode and converting them to RGB.
2. The bug occurs when the function attempts to convert PNG images in RGBA mode to RGB. It creates a new background image with all white pixels and then pastes the original image onto this background. However, this process does not take into account the transparency of the original RGBA image.
3. The bug arises due to incorrect handling of transparent pixels in RGBA images when converting to RGB. The output RGB image does not preserve the correct colors due to this oversight.
4. To fix the bug, we need to ensure that transparent pixels in RGBA images are correctly handled when converting to RGB.
5. I will provide a corrected version of the function below.

### Corrected Function
```python
def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
    if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA':
        background = Image.new('RGB', image.size, (255, 255, 255))
        background.paste(image, (0, 0), image.split()[-1])  # Preserve transparency
        image = background
    elif image.mode != 'RGB':
        image = image.convert('RGB')

    if size:
        image = image.copy()
        image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)

    buf = BytesIO()
    image.save(buf, 'JPEG')
    return image, buf
```

By correcting the transparent pixel handling in RGBA to RGB conversion, the function should now produce the expected output for all test cases.
