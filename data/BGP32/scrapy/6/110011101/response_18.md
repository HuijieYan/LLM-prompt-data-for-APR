### Analysis
The buggy function `convert_image` is intended to convert images to the RGB mode and optionally resize them. The bug occurs when the input image format is 'PNG' and the mode is 'RGBA'. In this case, the function attempts to create a new image with a white background before conversion. However, the `paste` method is used incorrectly, affecting the result. Additionally, when the image mode is not 'RGB', the function should convert it, but this case is not being handled correctly.

### Bug
The bug arises from incorrectly using the `paste` method with the wrong mode when dealing with 'PNG' images in 'RGBA' mode. This results in incorrect conversion and failure to pass the test. Additionally, the conversion of non-'RGB' images is not being handled properly.

### Fix
1. Modify the method of pasting the image when dealing with 'PNG' images in 'RGBA' mode.
2. Adjust the conversion of non-'RGB' images to ensure they are correctly converted.

### Corrected Function
```python
def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
    if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA':
        background = Image.new('RGBA', image.size, (255, 255, 255))
        background.paste(image, (0, 0), image)
        image = background.convert('RGB')
    elif image.mode != 'RGB':
        image = image.convert('RGB')

    if size:
        image = image.copy()
        image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)

    buf = BytesIO()
    image.save(buf, 'JPEG')
    return image, buf
``` 

The corrected function includes the correct usage of `paste` to handle 'PNG' images with 'RGBA' mode and adjusts the conversion of non-'RGB' images to ensure they are converted correctly.
