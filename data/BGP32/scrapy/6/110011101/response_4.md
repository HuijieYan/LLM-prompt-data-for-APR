### Bug Explanation
The bug in the `convert_image` function lies in the conditional block that handles the case when the input image format is 'PNG' and the mode is 'RGBA'. The bug causes the function to incorrectly convert the image to RGB by creating a new RGB image with a white background and pasting the original image over it. However, the pasting operation is incorrect, leading to the loss of transparency values.

### Bug Location
The bug is located in the following block of code:
```python
if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA':
    background = Image.new('RGBA', image.size, (255, 255, 255))
    background.paste(image, image)
    image = background.convert('RGB')
```

### Bug Cause
In the conditional block, the `paste` function is used incorrectly. The `paste` function takes a position as the second argument, not the image itself. By passing `image` as the second argument, it treats it as a position instead of an image.

### Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, the `paste` function should be called with the correct arguments. The original image should be pasted onto the background image at position (0, 0).

### Corrected Version
Here is the corrected version of the `convert_image` function:
```python
def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
    if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA':
        background = Image.new('RGBA', image.size, (255, 255, 255))
        background.paste(image, (0, 0))
        image = background.convert('RGB')
    elif image.mode != 'RGB':
        image = image.convert('RGB')

    if size:
        image = image.copy()
        image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)

    buf = BytesIO()
    image.save(buf, 'JPEG')
    return image, buf
```
