### Analysis
The buggy function is responsible for converting images to a specific format and size. The bug lies in the condition that checks if the image format is 'PNG' and the mode is 'RGBA'. When both conditions are met, the function creates a new background image and pastes the original image onto it before converting the image to 'RGB' mode. However, the bug is in the line `background.paste(image, image)` where the same image is being pasted on itself, resulting in incorrect conversion for PNG images with RGBA mode.

### Bug
The bug is caused by pasting the original image onto itself when the format is 'PNG' and mode is 'RGBA'. This results in incorrect behavior in image conversion, leading to failed tests.

### Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we should paste the original image onto the background image instead of pasting it onto itself. This way, the conversion for PNG images with RGBA mode will proceed correctly.

### The corrected version of the function
```python
def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
    if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA':
        background = Image.new('RGBA', image.size, (255, 255, 255))
        background.paste(image, (0, 0))
        image = background.convert('RGB')
    elif image.mode != 'RGB':
        image = image.convert('RGB')

    if size:
        image = image.copy()
        image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)

    buf = BytesIO()
    image.save(buf, 'JPEG')
    return image, buf
``` 

By correcting the image pasting line to `background.paste(image, (0, 0))`, we ensure that the image is pasted on the background image correctly, resolving the bug and passing the failing tests.
