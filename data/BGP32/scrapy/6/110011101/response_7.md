### Analysis
- The function `convert_image` is designed to handle images by converting them to a specific format and resizing them if necessary.
- The current implementation has a bug that incorrectly handles PNG images with RGBA mode.
- The bug occurs when the input image is a PNG image with RGBA mode, leading to an incorrect conversion process that results in wrong color values.
- The bug is specifically related to the handling of PNG images with RGBA mode.

### Bug Fix Strategy
- Fix the handling of PNG images with RGBA mode by ensuring that the transparency channel is correctly managed during the conversion process.
- When processing PNG images in RGBA mode, preserve the transparency information to maintain the correct color values.
- Adjust the code logic to handle RGBA mode images in a manner that correctly converts them to RGB while maintaining the correct color values, especially in the transparent areas.

### Corrected Version
```python
from PIL import Image
from cStringIO import StringIO as BytesIO

class ImagesPipeline(FilesPipeline):
    def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
        if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA':
            # Create an RGBA image with a white background
            background = Image.new('RGBA', image.size, (255, 255, 255, 255))
            # Composite the original image onto the white background preserving transparency
            image = Image.alpha_composite(background, image)
            # Convert the RGBA image to RGB preserving the colors
            image = image.convert('RGB')
        elif image.mode not in ['RGB', 'RGBA']:
            image = image.convert('RGB')
        
        if size:
            # Create a copy of the image before resizing to maintain the original
            image_copy = image.copy()
            # Resize the copied image to the specified size
            image_copy.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)
            # Replace the original image with the resized image
            image = image_copy
        
        buf = BytesIO()
        # Save the image as JPEG
        image.save(buf, 'JPEG')
        return image, buf
```

The corrected version of the `convert_image` function correctly handles PNG images with RGBA mode by compositing the original image onto a white background before converting it to RGB. This preserves the transparency and color values, ensuring that the converted image maintains the correct colors.
