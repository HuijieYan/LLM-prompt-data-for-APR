### Analysis
The buggy function `convert_image` is intended to handle images with different formats and modes, converting them to RGB mode and resizing them if necessary. The bug lies in the condition that checks if the format is PNG and mode is RGBA. In this case, it should create a new background image and paste the original image onto it before converting it to RGB.

### Bug Explanation
The bug occurs in the block that handles PNG images with RGBA mode. The background image is created correctly, but when it pastes the original image onto the background, incorrect arguments are passed to the `paste` method. This results in the original image not being correctly pasted onto the background, leading to an incorrect conversion.

### Bug Fix
To fix the bug, we need to pass the correct argument to the `paste` method. The corrected version should correctly paste the original image onto the background image.

### Corrected Version
```python
def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
    if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA':
        background = Image.new('RGBA', image.size, (255, 255, 255, 255))  # Include alpha channel in background
        background.paste(image, (0, 0), image)  # Correctly pass the original image to be pasted onto the background
        image = background.convert('RGB')
    elif image.mode != 'RGB':
        image = image.convert('RGB')

    if size:
        image = image.copy()
        image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)

    buf = BytesIO()
    image.save(buf, 'JPEG')
    return image, buf
``` 

By fixing the bug in the pasting part of the function, the corrected version should now handle PNG images with RGBA format correctly.
