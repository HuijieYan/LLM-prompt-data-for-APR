## Bug Explanation

The bug in the `convert_image` function is related to the conversion of images with PNG format and RGBA mode. In the code snippet provided, there is a condition that checks if the image format is PNG and the mode is RGBA. If this condition is met, the code creates a new image `background` with RGBA mode and pastes the original image onto it. After that, it converts the image to RGB mode. However, when the original image is pasted onto the background image, the paste operation is incorrect, leading to an incorrect color mixture.

## Bug Fix Strategy

To fix the bug, we need to correct the way the original image is pasted onto the background image in the case where the image has PNG format and RGBA mode. We need to ensure that the alpha channel (transparency) is correctly handled during the paste operation.

## Corrected Version

Here is the corrected version of the `convert_image` function:

```python
def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
    if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA':
        background = Image.new('RGBA', image.size, (255, 255, 255, 255))  # Add alpha channel for background
        background.paste(image, (0, 0), image)  # Paste image with transparency
        image = background.convert('RGB')
    elif image.mode != 'RGB':
        image = image.convert('RGB')

    if size:
        image = image.copy()
        image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)

    buf = BytesIO()
    image.save(buf, 'JPEG')
    return image, buf
```

This corrected version ensures that the transparency of the original image is preserved when pasting it onto the background image before converting to RGB mode. This fix should now pass the failing test cases provided.
