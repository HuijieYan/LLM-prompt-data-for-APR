### Bug Analysis:
The bug occurs in the `convert_image` function due to incorrect handling of images with transparency. When the image format is 'PNG' and the mode is 'RGBA', the code tries to convert the image to 'RGB' by pasting it on a white background. However, the background is created with the RGBA mode, causing the image to retain its transparency.

### Bug Explanation:
In Case 3 where the input image is RGBA PNG, the bug arises because pasting an RGBA image onto an RGBA background retains the transparency of the image, affecting the color calculations. This results in the test failing due to incorrect image color values.

### Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to create a new RGB background when the input image is RGBA PNG. This will ensure that the transparency is removed, and the color calculations happen correctly.

### The corrected version of the function:
```python
from PIL import Image
from cStringIO import StringIO as BytesIO

class ImagesPipeline(FilesPipeline):
    def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
        if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA':
            # Create a new RGB background without transparency
            background = Image.new('RGB', image.size, (255, 255, 255))
            background.paste(image, (0, 0), image)
            image = background
        elif image.mode != 'RGB':
            image = image.convert('RGB')
    
        if size:
            image = image.copy()
            image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)
    
        buf = BytesIO()
        image.save(buf, 'JPEG')
        return image, buf
```

By making the above change in the `convert_image` function, the bug related to incorrect color calculations for RGBA PNG images should be resolved, and the failing test cases should pass without issues.
