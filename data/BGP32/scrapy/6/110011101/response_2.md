### Correction of the bug in the `convert_image` function

#### Issue:
The bug in the `convert_image` function lies in the conditional block that handles PNG images with RGBA mode. The background image is being pasted incorrectly onto itself, resulting in incorrect image conversion.

#### Cause of the bug:
- In the conditional block for PNG images with RGBA mode, the `paste` method is used incorrectly by passing the same image (`image`) as the source image and the paste image, which results in pasting the image onto itself.

#### Solution:
To fix the bug, we need to paste the `image` onto the `background` image instead of onto itself.

#### Updated/Corrected `convert_image` function:
```python
def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
    if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA':
        background = Image.new('RGBA', image.size, (255, 255, 255))
        background.paste(image, (0, 0), image)  # Corrected line
        image = background.convert('RGB')
    elif image.mode != 'RGB':
        image = image.convert('RGB')

    if size:
        image = image.copy()
        image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)

    buf = BytesIO()
    image.save(buf, 'JPEG')
    return image, buf
```

By using the corrected approach of pasting the image onto the background image, the function should now handle RGBA images correctly and generate the expected output. This fix should address the failing tests and ensure that the function behaves as intended for all image formats and modes.
