### Analysis
- The buggy function `convert_image()` is intended to convert an image to RGB format and perform resizing if a size parameter is provided.
- The bug originates from the incorrect handling of images with 'PNG' format and 'RGBA' mode. In this case, it converts the image to RGB format but does not consider the transparency channel.
- The issue arises when the function attempts to convert a PNG image in 'RGBA' mode to RGB format while retaining the original color.
- The specific problem occurs because it doesn't properly handle images with transparency (RGBA) and skew what the actual resulting RGB values should be.

### Bug Explanation
The issue lies in the following block of code:
```python
if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA':
    background = Image.new('RGBA', image.size, (255, 255, 255))
    background.paste(image, image)
    image = background.convert('RGB')
```
1. It creates a new RGBA background with white color, pastes the original image onto it, and then converts it to RGB, discarding all transparency information.
2. The actual conversion should consider the transparency when creating the background, preserving the colors properly.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug
To fix the bug, we need to modify the block mentioned above to handle the transparency correctly. Instead of pasting the image directly on a white background, we should create a blank RGB image but fill it with the original background color (without transparency). This way, we preserve both the color information and the transparency.

### Correction
Here is the corrected version of the `convert_image()` function:

```python
def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
    if image.mode == 'RGBA':
        background = Image.new('RGB', image.size, (255, 255, 255))
        background.paste(image, image)
        image = background
    elif image.mode != 'RGB':
        image = image.convert('RGB')

    if size:
        image = image.copy()
        image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)

    buf = BytesIO()
    image.save(buf, 'JPEG')
    return image, buf
```

With this correction, the function will properly handle images with transparencies (RGBA) and convert them to RGB format while preserving the original color information. This fix should address the failing test cases as well.
