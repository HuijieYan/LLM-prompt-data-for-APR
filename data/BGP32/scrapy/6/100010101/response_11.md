### Analysis
There are a few issues in the buggy function that need to be addressed:
1. In the condition where the image format is 'PNG' and mode is 'RGBA', the background image is being pasted incorrectly. The correct method to paste an image onto another one is `background.paste(image, (0, 0), image)`.
2. The condition for checking if the image mode is not 'RGB' is insufficient and may not cover all cases where conversion is needed.

### Bug Cause
The bug occurs when trying to handle RGBA images where the background image is not pasted correctly, leading to incorrect conversions and failing the test cases.

### Fix Strategy
1. Modify the background paste operation to correctly paste the image onto the background.
2. Update the condition for image mode conversion to handle all non-RGB cases effectively.

### Corrected Version
```python
def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
    if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA':
        background = Image.new('RGBA', image.size, (255, 255, 255))
        background.paste(image, (0, 0), image)
        image = background.convert('RGB')
    elif image.mode != 'RGB':
        image = image.convert('RGB')

    if size:
        image = image.copy()
        image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)

    buf = BytesIO()
    image.save(buf, 'JPEG')
    return image, buf
``` 

After applying the corrections, the function should now correctly handle RGBA images and pass the failing test cases.
