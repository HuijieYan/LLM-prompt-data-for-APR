### Analysis
- The buggy function is supposed to convert images to RGB format and optionally resize them while also handling special cases like RGBA and PNG formats.
- The error message indicates that in a specific test case, the converted image has incorrect colors after conversion.
- The bug seems to be related to handling RGBA images with a PNG format.

### Bug Explanation
- The bug occurs due to incorrect handling of RGBA images with a PNG format. The function is not correctly converting RGBA images to RGB format.
- When the function encounters an image with PNG format and RGBA mode, it creates a new background image as RGBA and pastes the original image onto it. This results in a loss of transparency and affects the colors of the image after conversion.

### Bug Fix Strategy
- To fix the bug, we need to ensure that when dealing with PNG images in RGBA mode, transparency is preserved during the conversion to RGB format.
- We should create a new background image in RGB format, paste the original RGBA image onto it while preserving transparency, and then convert the composite image to RGB format.

### Corrected Function
```python
def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
    if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA':
        background = Image.new('RGB', image.size, (255, 255, 255))
        background.paste(image, (0, 0), image)
        image = background.convert('RGB')
    elif image.mode != 'RGB':
        image = image.convert('RGB')

    if size:
        image = image.copy()
        image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)

    buf = BytesIO()
    image.save(buf, 'JPEG')
    return image, buf
``` 

By creating a new background in RGB format, preserving the transparency during pasting, and then converting to RGB format, we fix the bug related to handling PNG images in RGBA mode. This corrected function should now pass the failing test case and satisfy all expected input/output values.
