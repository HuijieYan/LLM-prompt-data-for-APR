## Analysis
The `convert_image` function is designed to convert an image to RGB mode and resize it if a size argument is provided. However, there are a few issues in the existing implementation:
1. The condition to handle PNG images with RGBA mode is incorrect, leading to an incorrect conversion.
2. The pasting of the image onto a background with the same image itself is not the correct way to handle transparency issues in PNG images.
3. The function always saves the image in JPEG format, which might not be desired.

## Bug
The bug occurs when the function tries to convert a PNG image with RGBA mode. The function attempts to paste the image onto a white background, resulting in an incorrect conversion and color transformation.

## Fix
1. Correct the condition to handle PNG images with RGBA mode appropriately for transparency.
2. Modify the handling of PNG images with RGBA mode to properly convert them to RGB without losing transparency.
3. Allow the function to save the image in its original format.

## Corrected Function
```python
def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
    if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA':
        # Create a new RGBA image with a white background
        background = Image.new('RGBA', image.size, (255, 255, 255, 255))
        # Composite the original RGBA image onto the white background
        transparent = Image.alpha_composite(background, image)
        # Convert the composited image to RGB mode, using white as the background color
        image = transparent.convert('RGB', background=(255, 255, 255))
    elif image.mode != 'RGB':
        image = image.convert('RGB')

    if size:
        image = image.copy()
        image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)

    buf = BytesIO()
    image.save(buf, format=image.format)
    return image, buf
```

By implementing the correct handling for PNG images with RGBA mode and allowing the function to save the image in its original format, the corrected function should now pass the failing test cases and satisfy the expected input/output values.
