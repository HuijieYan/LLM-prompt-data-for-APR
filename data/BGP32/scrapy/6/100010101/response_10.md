### Bug Analysis:
The buggy function has an issue when dealing with PNG images in RGBA mode. It incorrectly handles the conversion of RGBA images to RGB format by pasting the RGBA image onto a newly created RGBA background and converting it to RGB. This method results in loss of transparency information, leading to incorrect output values and failing the test cases for PNG images with transparency.

### Bug Explanation:
1. When processing a PNG image with RGBA mode, the function creates a white RGBA background and directly pastes the original RGBA image onto it. This results in a loss of transparency information since a white background replaces the transparent areas of the original image.
2. The conversion mistake causes the function to produce incorrect color values when verifying the converted PNG image with transparency.

### Bug Fix:
To fix this bug, we need to handle the RGBA to RGB conversion properly, preserving the transparency information. One way to achieve this is by applying the `convert('RGB')` operation directly to the RGBA image without pasting it onto a white background. This approach will retain the original transparency information of the image during the conversion process.

### Corrected Function:
```python
def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
    if image.mode == 'RGBA':
        image = image.convert('RGB')
    elif image.mode != 'RGB':
        image = image.convert('RGB')

    if size:
        image = image.copy()
        image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)

    buf = BytesIO()
    image.save(buf, 'JPEG')
    return image, buf
```

By directly converting RGBA images to RGB mode without a background paste operation, the corrected function preserves the transparency information of PNG images correctly. This fix should pass the failing test cases and produce the expected output values for all scenarios described.
