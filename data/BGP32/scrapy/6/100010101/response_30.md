### Analysis:
The buggy function `convert_image()` is intended to convert images to either RGB mode or resize them if needed. However, there are issues with the handling of images that are in RGBA format and PNG format. The bug occurs when the function tries to handle RGBA PNG images, leading to incorrect color values when converting to RGB. This results in failing test cases that expect specific color values in the converted images.

### Potential Error Locations:
1. Incorrect handling of RGBA images when converting to RGB mode.
2. The usage of `background.paste(image, image)` where `image` should be passed as a tuple.
3. The lack of accurate handling for PNG transparency issues.

### Bug Explanation:
The bug arises from the mismanagement of transparency in RGBA images with PNG format. When converting from RGBA to RGB, the background needs to be set correctly to avoid color distortions due to transparency.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Check the condition if the image format is PNG and the mode is RGBA to ensure correct handling.
2. When pasting the RGBA image on a background, ensure to pass it as a tuple and not directly as the image.
3. Implement appropriate handling for PNG transparency while converting images to RGB mode.

### Corrected Code:
```python
def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
    if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA':
        background = Image.new('RGBA', image.size, (255, 255, 255, 255))  # Include alpha channel in background color
        background.paste(image, (0, 0), image)  # Pass image as a tuple when pasting
        image = background.convert('RGB')
    elif image.mode != 'RGB':
        image = image.convert('RGB')

    if size:
        image = image.copy()
        image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)

    buf = BytesIO()
    # Save as JPEG with proper quality
    image.save(buf, 'JPEG', quality=100)  
    return image, buf
```

By making these corrections, the function should now handle RGBA PNG images correctly, avoiding color distortions and passing all test cases with the expected color values.
