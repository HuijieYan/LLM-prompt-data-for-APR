### Potential Error Locations
1. The condition checking for PNG format and RGBA mode may be incorrect.
2. The conversion process for PNG format and RGBA mode may not be handling transparency correctly.

### Cause of the Bug
The bug seems to be related to the incorrect handling of transparency in images with PNG format and RGBA mode. The code is converting the image incorrectly, resulting in an incorrect output when compared with the expected image.

### Fixing the Bug Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to make sure that transparency in images with PNG format and RGBA mode is handled correctly during the conversion process. This involves properly handling the alpha channel to maintain the desired transparency in the resulting image.

### Corrected Version of the Function
```python
def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
    if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA':
        background = Image.new('RGBA', image.size, (255, 255, 255, 255))  # Including alpha for white background
        background.paste(image, (0, 0), mask=image.split()[3])  # Paste with alpha channel
        image = background.convert('RGB')
    elif image.mode != 'RGB':
        image = image.convert('RGB')

    if size:
        image = image.copy()
        image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)

    buf = BytesIO()
    image.save(buf, 'JPEG')
    return image, buf
```

By pasting the image onto a white background with an alpha channel and preserving transparency during the conversion, the corrected function should now handle PNG images with RGBA mode correctly. This fix ensures that the resulting images maintain their transparency as expected.
