### Bug Explanation
The bug in the `convert_image` function arises from how the function handles images with transparency when their format is PNG and mode is RGBA. The function attempts to convert these images to RGB format by creating a new RGBA background with a white color and pasting the original image on top of it. However, the `paste` method expects a tuple representing the upper left corner as the second argument but receives the image object `image` instead. This leads to incorrect image processing and pixel values, causing the test to fail.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to correctly paste the original image onto the white background by providing the upper left corner as a tuple. Additionally, we need to address the conversion of the image mode to RGB for images that are not already in RGB format.

### Corrected Version
```python
from PIL import Image
from io import BytesIO

def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
    if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA':
        background = Image.new('RGBA', image.size, (255, 255, 255))
        background.paste(image, (0, 0), image)
        image = background.convert('RGB')
    elif image.mode != 'RGB':
        image = image.convert('RGB')

    if size:
        image = image.copy()
        image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)

    buf = BytesIO()
    image.save(buf, 'JPEG')
    return image, buf
```

By making these corrections, the `convert_image` function will now correctly handle images with transparency and convert them to RGB format when necessary, ensuring that the function passes the failing test cases and meets the expected input/output values.
