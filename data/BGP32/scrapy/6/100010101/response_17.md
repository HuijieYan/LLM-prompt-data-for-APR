### Analysis
The buggy function `convert_image` is intended to convert images to RGB format and resize them if necessary. However, the bug occurs when converting RGBA images to RGB format. Instead of handling transparency properly, the function simply replaces the transparent areas with white color, leading to incorrect results.

The error message indicates that the function is failing to correctly convert RGBA images with transparency to RGB format. The bug is most likely related to how transparency is being handled during the conversion process.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to handle transparency correctly when converting RGBA images to RGB format. One approach is to use the `convert` method provided by the PIL library, which allows for proper handling of transparency channels.

### The corrected function
```python
def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
    if image.mode in ['RGBA', 'LA'] or (image.mode == 'P' and 'transparency' in image.info):
        image = image.convert('RGBA')
        background = Image.new('RGBA', image.size, (255, 255, 255, 255))
        background.paste(image, image)
        image = background.convert('RGB')
    elif image.mode != 'RGB':
        image = image.convert('RGB')

    if size:
        image = image.copy()
        image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)

    buf = BytesIO()
    image.save(buf, 'JPEG')
    return image, buf
```

In the corrected version of the function:
- We first check if the image mode is RGBA or LA (L with alpha channel) or if it's a palette mode image with transparency information.
- If the above condition is true, we convert the image to RGBA format.
- We then create a new RGBA background image with white color and paste the original image onto it.
- Finally, we convert the new RGBA image to RGB format to remove the transparency properly.
- The conversion process now handles transparency correctly, ensuring that the output image is accurate.

By making these changes, the function should now properly handle transparency when converting RGBA images to RGB format, passing the failing test and satisfying all the expected input/output values.
