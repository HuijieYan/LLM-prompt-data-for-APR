### Analysis
The buggy function is designed to convert images to JPEG format and make some adjustments based on the image mode. The error message indicates a failing test related to the conversion of an RGBA PNG image to RGB. The issue seems to be with the color values after the conversion.

### Issues
1. When converting an RGBA PNG image to RGB, the color values are not being calculated correctly, leading to incorrect results in the test.

### Bug Cause
The buggy function does not handle the conversion of RGBA images to RGB properly. The conversion formula or method is incorrect, leading to a mismatch in color values.

### Solution Strategy
1. Check the conversion logic for RGBA to RGB images.
2. Ensure that color values are calculated accurately during the conversion.
3. Update the function to correctly handle RGBA to RGB conversions.

### Corrected Version
```python
def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
    if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA':
        background = Image.new('RGB', image.size, (255, 255, 255))
        background.paste(image, (0, 0), image)
        image = background.convert('RGB')
    elif image.mode != 'RGB':
        image = image.convert('RGB')

    if size:
        image = image.copy()
        image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)

    buf = BytesIO()
    image.save(buf, 'JPEG')
    return image, buf
```

By updating the conversion logic for RGBA to RGB images in the corrected version, the function should now pass the failing test cases and provide the expected outputs for the given scenarios.
