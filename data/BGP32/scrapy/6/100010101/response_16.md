### Analysis
- The buggy function `convert_image` is designed to handle different image formats and modes, converting them to RGB and resizing if necessary.
- The error message indicates a failure in a test case where the converted image does not match the expected colors.
- The failing test cases involve scenarios where the image needs to be converted from RGBA to RGB.
- The function incorrectly pastes the image onto a white background, leading to incorrect conversion.
- The issue is likely in the conditional block that handles PNG images with RGBA mode, where a white background is created and the image is pasted onto it.

### Bug Cause
- The bug is caused by the incorrect usage of the `paste` method when creating a white background for PNG images with RGBA mode. 
- Instead of using `background.paste(image, image)`, the correct usage should be `background.paste(image, (0, 0), image)`. 
- The incorrect usage results in the original RGBA image being pasted onto the white background, causing unexpected colors in the final converted image.

### Fix Strategy
- Modify the conditional block that handles PNG images with RGBA mode to correctly paste the image onto the white background.
- Use the `paste` method with the correct syntax: `background.paste(image, (0, 0), image)`.

### Corrected Version
```python
def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
    if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA':
        background = Image.new('RGBA', image.size, (255, 255, 255))
        background.paste(image, (0, 0), image)  # Corrected 'paste' method usage
        image = background.convert('RGB')
    elif image.mode != 'RGB':
        image = image.convert('RGB')

    if size:
        image = image.copy()
        image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)

    buf = BytesIO()
    image.save(buf, 'JPEG')
    return image, buf
``` 

The corrected version of the function should now correctly handle the conversion of PNG images with RGBA mode to RGB, ensuring that the converted image matches the expected colors in the test cases.
