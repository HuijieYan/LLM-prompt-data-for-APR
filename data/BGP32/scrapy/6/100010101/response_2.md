### Bug explanation:
The bug occurs in the conditional block that handles images with format 'PNG' and mode 'RGBA'. In this block, the function creates a new RGBA background image and tries to paste the original RGBA image onto it. However, the `paste` method accepts a single argument as the image to be pasted, but is mistakenly given two arguments (`image, image`).

This mistake leads to the image not being pasted correctly onto the background, resulting in the conversion to RGB losing transparency information. As a result, the test case fails when it compares the color values of the converted image.

### Bug fix strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to correct the paste operation on the background image by providing only the original RGBA image as the argument. This way, the transparency information will be preserved, and the conversion to RGB will maintain the correct color values.

### Corrected function:
```python
def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
    if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA':
        background = Image.new('RGBA', image.size, (255, 255, 255))
        background.paste(image)
        image = background.convert('RGB')
    elif image.mode != 'RGB':
        image = image.convert('RGB')

    if size:
        image = image.copy()
        image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)

    buf = BytesIO()
    image.save(buf, 'JPEG')
    return image, buf
``` 

By correcting the paste operation, the transparency information in the PNG image will be preserved during the conversion to RGB, ensuring that the test cases pass successfully.
