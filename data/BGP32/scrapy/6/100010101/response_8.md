### Bug Analysis
The bug in the `convert_image` function lies in the conditional block that attempts to handle PNG images with RGBA mode. The code creates a new RGBA background image, pastes the original image onto it, and converts the background image to RGB. However, the paste operation does not work correctly on RGBA images, leading to an incorrect conversion.

The error message in the failing test indicates a discrepancy in the color values when comparing the converted image with the expected values. This discrepancy arises due to the incorrect handling of the RGBA image during conversion.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to handle RGBA images correctly during the conversion process. One way to address this issue is to separate the handling for RGBA images from other image modes. For RGBA images, we should convert them to RGB without creating a new background image and pasting operations.

### Corrected Function
```python
def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
    if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA':
        # Separate handling for RGBA images
        image = image.convert('RGB')
    elif image.mode != 'RGB':
        image = image.convert('RGB')

    if size:
        image = image.copy()
        image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)

    buf = BytesIO()
    image.save(buf, 'JPEG')
    return image, buf
```

By making this change, the function should now correctly handle RGBA images during conversion, resolving the bug and passing the failing tests.
