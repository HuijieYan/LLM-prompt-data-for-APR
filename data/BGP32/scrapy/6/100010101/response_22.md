The buggy function has a problem when handling PNG images with RGBA mode. The issue arises when converting such images to RGB format. The buggy code does not correctly handle the transparency channel, resulting in incorrect colors being displayed in the converted image.

The bug occurs in the following block of code:
```python
elif image.mode == 'RGBA':
    background = Image.new('RGBA', image.size, (255, 255, 255))
    background.paste(image, image)
    image = background.convert('RGB')
```

In this block, the `background` image is created with a white background, but this background color should consider the transparency channel in the original RGBA image for correct color blending. 

To fix this bug, we should modify the way the background is created by taking into account the existing transparency in the image. We can do this by using the `paste` function with a mask parameter that takes the transparency channel into account.

Here is the corrected version of the function:
```python
from PIL import Image
from io import BytesIO

# The relative path of the corrected file: scrapy/pipelines/images.py

def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
    if image.mode == 'RGBA':
        background = Image.new('RGBA', image.size, (255, 255, 255, 255))
        background.paste(image, (0, 0), image)
        image = background.convert('RGB')
    elif image.mode != 'RGB':
        image = image.convert('RGB')

    if size:
        image = image.copy()
        image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)

    buf = BytesIO()
    image.save(buf, 'JPEG')
    return image, buf
```

By making these changes, the function should now correctly handle PNG images with RGBA mode and produce the expected output colors.
