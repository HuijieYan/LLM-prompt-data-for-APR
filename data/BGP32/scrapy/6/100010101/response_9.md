### Analysis
The buggy function `convert_image` is intended to take an image as input and perform several operations on it, including converting it to RGB mode and resizing it if a size parameter is provided. The bug seems to be related to the incorrect handling of RGBA images when converting them to RGB mode, leading to incorrect color values.

### Error
The error occurs when the function tries to convert an RGBA PNG image to RGB mode. It fails to correctly handle the transparency channel, resulting in incorrect color values in the converted image.

### Cause
The bug is caused by the improper handling of RGBA images in the function. When converting RGBA images to RGB mode, the transparency channel is not considered, leading to incorrect color values in the converted image.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that when converting RGBA images to RGB mode, the transparency channel is properly handled to preserve the correct color values.

### Corrected Version of the Function
```python
def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
    if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA':
        background = Image.new('RGB', image.size, (255, 255, 255))
        background.paste(image, (0, 0), image)
        image = background
    elif image.mode != 'RGB':
        image = image.convert('RGB')
    
    if size:
        image = image.copy()
        image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)
    
    buf = BytesIO()
    image.save(buf, 'JPEG')
    return image, buf
```

In the corrected version of the function, we handle RGBA images correctly by creating a new RGB image as the background and pasting the RGBA image onto it, taking into account the transparency channel. This ensures that the color values are preserved correctly when converting RGBA images to RGB mode.
