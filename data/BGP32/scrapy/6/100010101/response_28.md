### Analysis
The buggy function is intended to convert images to RGB mode and save them as JPEG files. There are two main issues causing the test to fail:
1. The function does not handle PNG images with RGBA mode correctly, as it should convert them to RGB mode after pasting on a white background.
2. In the case of images with a mode other than RGB, the function should convert them to RGB mode.

### Bug Fix Strategy
1. Add a condition to handle PNG images with RGBA mode correctly.
2. Convert images with modes other than RGB to RGB mode.

### The corrected function
```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: scrapy/pipelines/images.py

def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
    if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA':
        background = Image.new('RGBA', image.size, (255, 255, 255, 255))
        background.paste(image, (0, 0), image)
        image = background.convert('RGB')
    elif image.mode != 'RGB':
        image = image.convert('RGB')

    if size:
        image = image.copy()
        image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)

    buf = BytesIO()
    image.save(buf, 'JPEG')
    return image, buf
``` 

By making these changes, the function should now handle PNG images with RGBA mode correctly by converting them to RGB mode after pasting on a white background. Additionally, images with modes other than RGB will be converted to RGB mode before saving as JPEG files.
