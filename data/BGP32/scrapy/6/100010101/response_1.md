### Analysis
The buggy function is designed to convert images to RGB format, handle transparency from RGBA format, and create thumbnails if a size parameter is provided. The main issues in the function are:
1. In the first conditional block, when handling PNG RGBA images, the image is pasted onto a white background incorrectly. This results in the loss of transparency and incorrect conversion to RGB format.
2. In the second conditional block, the image is not properly copied before resizing it.
3. The function always saves the image as a JPEG, which might not be desired for all cases.

### Bug Cause
The bug causes incorrect handling of transparency and image conversion due to the issues mentioned in the analysis. The incorrect background paste operation and the lack of copying images before modification lead to unexpected results.

### Fix Strategy
1. Address the incorrect handling of RGBA images by properly pasting the image onto a new RGBA background to maintain transparency.
2. Ensure the image is copied before any modification so that the original image is preserved.
3. Allow the function to save images in the format of the original image provided.

### Corrected Function
```python
def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
    if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA':
        background = Image.new('RGBA', image.size, (255, 255, 255, 255))
        background.paste(image, (0, 0), image)
        image = background.convert('RGB')
    elif image.mode != 'RGB':
        image = image.convert('RGB')
    
    if size:
        thumb = image.copy()
        thumb.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)
        image = thumb
    
    buf = BytesIO()
    image.save(buf, image.format)
    
    return image, buf
```

With these changes, the function now properly handles RGBA PNG images, creates thumbnails without affecting the original image, and saves the images in their original format. This corrected version should pass the failing test cases and satisfy all the expected input/output values.
