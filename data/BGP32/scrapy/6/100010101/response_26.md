### Analysis
The buggy function `convert_image` is designed to convert image formats and modes based on certain conditions and then save the image as a JPEG file. However, the bug causes incorrect conversion of RGBA PNG images to RGB images, leading to the failing test.

### Identified Bug
The bug occurs in the first `if` statement where RGBA PNG images are not being properly converted to RGB format, resulting in incorrect colors. This is likely due to the incorrect usage of the `paste` method.

### Bug Cause
The bug is caused by incorrectly pasting the original image onto a new background image in the RGBA to RGB conversion section of the code. The `paste` method expects the image and the box tuple as arguments, but the same image is being provided for both arguments.

### Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we should correct the usage of the `paste` method to properly paste the original image onto the background image. Additionally, we can simplify the code logic by removing unnecessary duplicate conversions and making sure the image is not modified in place.

### Corrected Version
```python
def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
    if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA':
        background = Image.new('RGB', image.size, (255, 255, 255))
        background.paste(image, (0, 0), image)
        image = background
    elif image.mode != 'RGB':
        image = image.convert('RGB')

    if size:
        image_copy = image.copy()
        image_copy.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)
        image = image_copy

    buf = BytesIO()
    image.save(buf, 'JPEG')
    return image, buf
```

By making these changes, the corrected function should now properly convert RGBA PNG images to RGB images and pass the failing test cases.
