### Analysis:
- The buggy function `convert_image` is responsible for converting images to a specific format and size. The bug arises from the condition where it checks for PNG format and RGBA mode, converting the image to RGB mode using a white background.
- The bug occurs because the `paste` method expects a tuple (x, y) as the second argument to specify the position where the upper left corner of the pasted image will be placed. However, it mistakenly passes the image variable itself to the `paste` method.
- This results in an error and incorrect image conversion when handling PNG images with RGBA mode.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is caused by passing the `image` variable itself to the `paste` method in the line `background.paste(image, image)` within the conditional block for PNG format and RGBA mode. This causes the mentioned error and leads to incorrect image conversion.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
The correct way to use the `paste` method is to pass a tuple specifying the upper left corner position of the pasted image. The correct tuple should be of the form `(0, 0)` to indicate pasting from the top-left corner itself. By fixing this issue, we can avoid the error and correctly convert PNG images with RGBA mode.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
    if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA':
        background = Image.new('RGBA', image.size, (255, 255, 255))
        background.paste(image, (0, 0))  # Fix: Pass tuple (0, 0) for the paste position
        image = background.convert('RGB')
    elif image.mode != 'RGB':
        image = image.convert('RGB')

    if size:
        image = image.copy()
        image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)

    buf = BytesIO()
    image.save(buf, 'JPEG')
    return image, buf
```

By making this change in the `convert_image` function, we resolve the bug related to incorrect image conversion for PNG images with RGBA mode.
