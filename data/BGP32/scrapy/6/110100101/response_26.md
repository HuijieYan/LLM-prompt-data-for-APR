## Bug Fix

### Analysis:
The bug in the `convert_image` function is that the condition checking for the image format being `'PNG'` and mode being `'RGBA'` is incorrect. The code then mistakenly creates a new image with a white background and pastes the old image on it, converting it to RGB format. This creates an issue when the image format is not actually `'PNG'` but the mode is `'RGBA'`.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is caused by incorrect condition checking for the image format and mode. The code assumes that if the image format is `'PNG'` and the mode is `'RGBA'`, it needs to create a new RGB image with a white background, which is incorrect when the format is not `'PNG'`.

### Fix Strategy:
1. Update the condition to specifically check if the image format is `'PNG'` and the mode is `'RGBA'` before converting to RGB.
2. Ensure that the image mode is correctly handled based on the conditions.

### Updated Corrected Function:
```python
def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
    if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA':
        background = Image.new('RGBA', image.size, (255, 255, 255))
        background.paste(image, (0, 0), image)
        image = background.convert('RGB')
    elif image.mode != 'RGB':
        image = image.convert('RGB')

    if size:
        image = image.copy()
        image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)

    buf = BytesIO()
    image.save(buf, 'JPEG')
    return image, buf
```

By updating the condition to check for `'PNG'` and `'RGBA'` correctly and pasting the image at `(0, 0)` while creating the background, the function should now handle the image conversions correctly for all cases.
