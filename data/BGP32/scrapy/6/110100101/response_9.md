### Analysis
The buggy function `convert_image` has multiple issues that need to be addressed. 
1. In the first condition, when the image format is 'PNG' and mode is 'RGBA', there is an issue with pasting the image onto a new background. The `paste` method should receive the image itself as the second argument, not the `image` variable.
2. The second condition converts the image to 'RGB' if it's not already in 'RGB' mode. However, there is a missing clause to handle 'RGBA' mode images in this scenario.
3. When saving the image as a JPEG, the function should save it in 'JPEG' format, not 'PNG'.

### Bug Cause
- The first bug in the function arises from not correctly handling the pasting of the image onto a new background when the image is in 'PNG' format and 'RGBA' mode. This results in an incorrect conversion later on.
- The second bug is due to the lack of handling for 'RGBA' images when converting them to 'RGB'. This leads to incorrect mode conversions.
- Lastly, saving the image in 'PNG' format instead of 'JPEG' is a mistake that can lead to unexpected results.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug
1. Correct the pasting of the image onto a new background by using the correct arguments in the `Image.paste()` method.
2. Add a clause to convert 'RGBA' mode images to 'RGB' in the condition where the image mode is neither 'RGB' nor 'RGBA'.
3. Change the image saving format to 'JPEG' to match the intended functionality of the function.

### Corrected Version of the Function
```python
def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
    if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA':
        background = Image.new('RGBA', image.size, (255, 255, 255))
        background.paste(image, (0, 0), image)
        image = background.convert('RGB')
    elif image.mode not in ['RGB', 'RGBA']:
        image = image.convert('RGBA').convert('RGB')

    if size:
        image = image.copy()
        image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)

    buf = BytesIO()
    image.save(buf, 'JPEG')
    return image, buf
``` 

By making these corrections, the function should now correctly handle images with different modes and formats, leading to successful image conversions.
