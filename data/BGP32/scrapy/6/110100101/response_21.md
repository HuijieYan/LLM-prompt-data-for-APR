### Analyzing the buggy function
The `convert_image` function in the `ImagesPipeline` class is responsible for processing images, converting them to the desired format and resizing them if needed. There are multiple conditional blocks checking the image format and mode and performing conversions accordingly.

### Potential error locations
1. The conditional block checking if the image format is `'PNG'` and the mode is `'RGBA'` seems to have an issue where the `paste` method is not correctly used to combine the images.
2. The conversion logic in the function is in place, but the `image.save` method is set to save the image in JPEG format regardless of the input format.

### Cause of the bug
The bug arises from the incorrect usage of the `paste` method in the first conditional block. Additionally, the `image.save` method is set to save all images as JPEG, which ignores the original format.

### Strategy for fixing the bug
1. Fix the `paste` method usage to correctly combine images.
2. Update the `image.save` method to save the image in the original format instead of fixed to JPEG.

### Corrected version of the function
```python
def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
    if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA':
        background = Image.new('RGBA', image.size, (255, 255, 255))
        background.paste(image, (0, 0), image)  # Corrected paste method
        image = background.convert('RGB')
    elif image.mode != 'RGB':
        image = image.convert('RGB')

    if size:
        image = image.copy()
        image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)

    buf = BytesIO()
    image.save(buf, image.format)  # Save in the original format
    return image, buf
```

By implementing these changes in the `convert_image` function, the expected test cases should now pass without any issues.
