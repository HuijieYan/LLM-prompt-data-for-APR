## Analysis
The buggy function `convert_image` is responsible for converting images to a specified format and size. The function checks the format and mode of the input image and converts it accordingly. However, there are several issues in the function that need to be addressed:

1. In the first `if` condition, the condition should be for `image.format` to be `'PNG'` and `image.mode` to be `'RGBA'`, but the following lines are converting images to RGB regardless of the current mode.
2. The `background.paste(image, image)` line is incorrect, it should be `background.paste(image, (0, 0))` to properly paste the image onto the background.
3. The `if` condition for the size is also not correctly implemented. The function should create a separate copy of the image for resizing.
4. The function always saves the image in JPEG format, irrespective of the input image format.

## Bug Cause
The cause of the bug is primarily the incorrect logic used to convert images in different scenarios without considering the input image's format and mode. Additionally, the resizing logic is flawed, leading to incorrect thumbnail creation. Finally, saving the image in JPEG format irrespective of the input format leads to potential data loss.

## Strategy for Fixing the Bug
1. Check the input image format and mode in all scenarios and apply appropriate conversion methods.
2. Create a copy of the image before resizing to maintain the original image data.
3. Ensure that the saved image format matches the input image format to avoid data loss.

## Corrected Version of the Function
```python
def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
    if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA':
        background = Image.new('RGBA', image.size, (255, 255, 255))
        background.paste(image, (0, 0))
        image = background.convert('RGB')
    elif image.mode != 'RGB':
        image = image.convert('RGB')

    if size:
        image_copy = image.copy()
        image_copy.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)

    buf = BytesIO()
    if image.format == 'JPEG':
        image_copy.save(buf, 'JPEG')
    elif image.format == 'PNG':
        image_copy.save(buf, 'PNG')

    return image_copy, buf
```

With the corrections made to the function as described above, the `convert_image` function should now correctly handle different image formats, modes, and sizes, ensuring that the output matches the expected values in the failing test cases.
