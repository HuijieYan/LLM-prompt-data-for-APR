### Bug Explanation:
The bug in the `convert_image` function occurs due to improper handling of images with the format 'PNG' and mode 'RGBA'. In the current implementation:
- If the input image format is 'PNG' and mode is 'RGBA', a new RGBA background image is created, pasted with the input image, and then converted to RGB. However, the method `paste` expects a tuple as the second argument.
- Additionally, it converts all images to RGB mode if the mode is not 'RGB', which may not be desirable for images with different modes.
- Lastly, the buggy function always saves images in 'JPEG' format, ignoring the format of the input image.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to:
1. Fix the issue with pasting the input image onto the background by providing the correct tuple coordinates.
2. Only convert the image to RGB if the format is 'PNG' and mode is 'RGBA'.
3. Save the image based on its original format.

### Corrected Version of the `convert_image` function:
```python
def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
    if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA':
        background = Image.new('RGBA', image.size, (255, 255, 255, 255))
        background.paste(image, (0, 0), image)
        image = background.convert('RGB')
    elif image.mode != 'RGB' and not (image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA'):
        image = image.convert('RGB')

    if size:
        image = image.copy()
        image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)

    buf = BytesIO()
    image.save(buf, image.format)
    return image, buf
```

By making this correction, the `convert_image` function will properly handle images with different formats and modes according to the expected input/output values.
