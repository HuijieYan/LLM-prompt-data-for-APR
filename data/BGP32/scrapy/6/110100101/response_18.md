## Analysis:
The buggy function `convert_image` is designed to convert an image to RGB mode and generate a thumbnail if a size is provided. There are two main issues in the current function:
1. The condition to handle PNG images with RGBA mode is incorrect as it should create a new RGBA background image to properly handle transparency.
2. The conversion to JPEG format at the end of the function is hardcoded and should be replaced with a more dynamic approach based on the image format.

## Bug Cause:
- In the case of a PNG image with RGBA mode, the function incorrectly handles the background creation by using RGBA mode instead of RGB. This results in the loss of transparency.
- The hardcoded conversion to JPEG format at the end of the function doesn't consider the original image format, leading to incorrect output for PNG images.

## Fix Strategy:
1. Correct the background creation for PNG images with RGBA mode by creating a new RGBA background image to preserve transparency.
2. Modify the image save format to keep the output format consistent with the original image format.

## The corrected version of the function:

```python
def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
    if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA':
        background = Image.new('RGBA', image.size, (255, 255, 255, 255))
        background.paste(image, (0, 0), image)
        image = background.convert('RGB')
    elif image.mode != 'RGB':
        image = image.convert('RGB')

    if size:
        image = image.copy()
        image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)
        
    buf = BytesIO()
    # Save image using the original format
    image.save(buf, format=image.format)
    
    return image, buf
```

By making these corrections, the function should now handle PNG images with RGBA mode properly and retain the original image format when saving the image. This corrected version should pass the failing test cases and satisfy the expected input/output values.
