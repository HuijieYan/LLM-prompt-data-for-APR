## Analysis:
The buggy function `convert_image` is designed to handle image conversion and thumbnail generation. However, there are some issues in the current implementation:
1. The condition to check `image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA'` is incorrect as it should be `image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA'`.
2. The `paste` function for the background image is used incorrectly.
3. Saving the image as JPEG without checking the input format of the image, which may cause an error.

## Bug:
The bug in the function causes incorrect handling of images with format 'PNG' and mode 'RGBA'. It leads to the conversion not being correct for images in this format.

## Fix:
To fix the bug, we need to correct the conditions and functions used for converting the image. We also need to update the conditions for saving the image based on its format.

## Corrected Version:
```python
def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
        if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA':
            background = Image.new('RGBA', image.size, (255, 255, 255, 255))
            background.paste(image, (0, 0), image)
            image = background.convert('RGB')
        elif image.mode != 'RGB':
            image = image.convert('RGB')

        if size:
            image = image.copy()
            image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)

        buf = BytesIO()
        if image.format == 'PNG':
            image.save(buf, 'PNG')
        else:
            image.save(buf, 'JPEG')

        return image, buf
```

This corrected version of the function should be able to handle image conversions for different formats and modes correctly based on the provided test cases.
