## Analysis
1. The `convert_image` function is intended to convert images to RGB format and create thumbnails if a size is provided.
2. The bug is in the condition that checks if the image format is 'PNG' and mode is 'RGBA'. It creates a new background image in RGBA format, which is incorrect because the image is already in RGBA format. This causes the transparency to be lost when converting the image to RGB format.
3. Due to this bug, the function fails in cases where the input image is in PNG format with RGBA mode.
   
## Bug Explanation
The bug occurs in the function when the input image format is 'PNG' and mode is 'RGBA'. In this scenario, the function incorrectly creates a new background image in RGBA format, pastes the original image on it, and then converts the result to RGB format. This leads to the loss of transparency information, which is crucial in RGBA images. This behavior is not desired because it alters the original image incorrectly.

## Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we should handle PNG RGBA images differently to preserve the transparency information. Rather than creating a new background and pasting the image on it, we can directly convert the image to RGB format and preserve the alpha channel information.

## Corrected Code
Here is the corrected version of the `convert_image` function:

```python
def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
    original_mode = image.mode

    if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA':
        background = Image.new('RGBA', image.size, (255, 255, 255, 255))
        image = Image.alpha_composite(background, image)
        image = image.convert('RGB')
    elif image.mode != 'RGB':
        image = image.convert('RGB')

    if size:
        image = image.copy()
        image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)

    buf = BytesIO()
    image.save(buf, 'JPEG')
    return image, buf
```

By using `Image.alpha_composite` to blend the RGBA image with a white background to preserve transparency, the corrected code should now handle PNG RGBA images correctly while converting them to RGB format. This fix preserves the transparency information during the conversion process.
