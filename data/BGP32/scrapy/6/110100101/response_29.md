### Analysis
The buggy function `convert_image` within the `ImagesPipeline` class is responsible for converting images to a specific format and size. There are several issues in the implementation that are causing the failing test cases. The main issues are related to incorrect handling of different image formats and modes.

### Bugs in the Buggy Function
1. The condition to check if the image format is `'PNG'` and the mode is `'RGBA'` is incorrectly pasting the image on a new RGBA background. This should be done using the `alpha_composite` method instead.
2. The `Image.ANTIALIAS` parameter should be used inside the `thumbnail` method to ensure the image is resized correctly.
3. The final image format should be `'JPEG'` instead of `'RGB'`.

### Bug Causes
- In Case 1 and Case 2, the incorrect handling of the thumbnail resizing and image conversion causes the test to fail.
- In Case 3, the incorrect handling of the PNG format with an RGBA mode causes the test to fail.
- In Case 4, the incorrect handling of converting a palette image to RGB with transparency causes the test to fail.

### Bug Fixing Strategy
1. Use `alpha_composite` method for pasting images on a background.
2. Use `Image.ANTIALIAS` parameter in the `thumbnail` method for resizing.
3. Ensure the final image format is `'JPEG'`.

### Corrected Version of the Function
```python
def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
    if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA':
        background = Image.new('RGBA', image.size, (255, 255, 255, 255))
        background.alpha_composite(image)
        image = background.convert('RGB')
    elif image.mode != 'RGB':
        image = image.convert('RGB')

    if size:
        image = image.copy()
        image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)

    buf = BytesIO()
    image.save(buf, 'JPEG')
    return image, buf
```

With these corrections, the `convert_image` function should now pass the failing test cases and provide the expected output values for each case.
