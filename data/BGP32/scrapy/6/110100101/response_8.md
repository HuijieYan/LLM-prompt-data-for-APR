### Analyzing the buggy function
1. The `convert_image` function in the `ImagesPipeline` class is responsible for converting an image to a specific format and size.
2. The function checks if the image format is `'PNG'` and mode is `'RGBA'`, then tries to convert it to RGB by creating a new background image and pasting the original image on it.
3. It then checks if the image mode is not `'RGB'` and converts it to RGB.
4. Finally, if a size is provided, it resizes the image to that size and saves it in JPEG format.

### Identified issue
The issue is in the line `background.paste(image, image)`. The `Image.paste()` method takes a single image or an integer sequence, but in this case, it's being passed the image twice, resulting in unexpected behavior.

### Bug fix strategy
1. Update the `background.paste(image, image)` line to `background.paste(image)`.
2. Ensure that after this change, the image is pasted onto the background correctly.
3. Test the function to verify that it behaves as expected in all scenarios.

### Corrected version of the `convert_image` function
```python
def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
    if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA':
        background = Image.new('RGBA', image.size, (255, 255, 255))
        background.paste(image)
        image = background.convert('RGB')
    elif image.mode != 'RGB':
        image = image.convert('RGB')

    if size:
        image = image.copy()
        image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)

    buf = BytesIO()
    image.save(buf, 'JPEG')
    return image, buf
``` 

After making this change, the `convert_image` function should now correctly handle image conversion and resizing, passing all the test cases provided.
