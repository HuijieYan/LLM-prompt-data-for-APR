## Analysis
The `convert_image` function in the `ImagesPipeline` class is responsible for converting images to the desired format and size. The buggy function has a potential issue with handling RGBA PNG images.

## Identified Issue
The bug occurs when the input image is a PNG with RGBA mode. The function attempts to convert it to RGB by creating a new RGBA background and pasting the original image on it. This operation results in a wrong conversion of the image.

## Cause of the Bug
The bug is caused by the incorrect usage of the `paste` method in the RGBA to RGB conversion section of the code. The `paste` method should receive a tuple specifying the location to paste the image, but in this case, it is mistakenly using `image` twice, which indicates it should paste the image on itself.

## Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, the `paste` method should receive the correct arguments to properly paste the image on the background. Instead of passing `image` twice, we should specify the destination as `(0, 0)` to paste the image at the top left corner of the blank background.

## Corrected Version
Here is the corrected version of the `convert_image` function:

```python
def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
    if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA':
        background = Image.new('RGB', image.size, (255, 255, 255))
        background.paste(image, (0, 0))  # Paste the image in the correct location
        image = background
    elif image.mode != 'RGB':
        image = image.convert('RGB')

    if size:
        image = image.copy()
        image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)

    buf = BytesIO()
    image.save(buf, 'JPEG')
    return image, buf
```

By correcting the `paste` method call and adjusting the background image format, the function should now handle RGBA PNG images properly and pass the failing test.
