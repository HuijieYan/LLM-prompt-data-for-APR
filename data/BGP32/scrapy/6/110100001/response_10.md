## Analysis:
1. The `convert_image` function is supposed to handle the conversion of images to a specific format and size. 
2. The buggy function has a conditional check for `PNG` format and `RGBA` mode, where it attempts to convert the image to `RGB` mode if the conditions are met. However, there is an error in the way the image is pasted onto the background in this condition.
3. The error causes the function to fail when trying to paste the image onto the background and convert it to `RGB` mode, leading to a failure in the test.
4. To fix the bug, we need to correct the way the image is pasted onto the background when the format is `PNG` and mode is `RGBA`.

## Bug Fix:
```python
class ImagesPipeline(FilesPipeline):
    """
    Abstract pipeline that implements the image thumbnail generation logic
    """

    def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
        if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA':
            background = Image.new('RGBA', image.size, (255, 255, 255))
            background.paste(image, (0, 0), image)
            image = background.convert('RGB')
        elif image.mode != 'RGB':
            image = image.convert('RGB')
        
        if size:
            image = image.copy()
            image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)
        
        buf = BytesIO()
        image.save(buf, 'JPEG')
        return image, buf
```

By correcting the `background.paste(image, (0, 0), image)` line to pass the image correctly, the function should now work as intended and pass the failing test cases.
