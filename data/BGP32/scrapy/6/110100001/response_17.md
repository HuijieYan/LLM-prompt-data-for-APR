### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `convert_image` in the `ImagesPipeline` class is responsible for converting images to JPEG format and resizing them if a size is provided.
2. The potential error locations in the buggy function include incorrect handling of RGBA images when converting to RGB, incorrect thumbnail resizing logic, and incorrect saving of images to JPEG format.
3. The bug is likely caused by the incorrect handling of RGBA images where the background is not properly pasted before converting to RGB, resulting in loss of transparency.
4. To fix the bug, we need to ensure that RGBA images are correctly converted to RGB by pasting the image on a white background before conversion. Additionally, we need to correctly resize the images while maintaining aspect ratio and save them in the correct JPEG format.
5. Here is the corrected version of the `convert_image` function:

```python
def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
    if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA':
        background = Image.new('RGB', image.size, (255, 255, 255))
        background.paste(image, image)
        image = background.convert('RGB')
    elif image.mode != 'RGB':
        image = image.convert('RGB')

    if size:
        image = image.copy()
        image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)

    buf = BytesIO()
    image.save(buf, 'JPEG', quality=95)  # Save as JPEG with quality 95
    buf.seek(0)  # Reset buffer position to start
    return image, buf
```

By correctly pasting the RGBA image on a white background before converting to RGB, resizing the images while maintaining aspect ratio, and saving them in the correct JPEG format with quality specified, the function should now pass the failing test case.
