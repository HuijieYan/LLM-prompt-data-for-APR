## Analysis:
1. The `convert_image` function in the `ImagesPipeline` class is responsible for converting images to the desired format and size.
2. The potential error locations in the function could be the conditions for checking image format and mode, and the thumbnail resizing logic.
3. The cause of the bug is that in the original `convert_image` function, when the image format is 'PNG' and mode is 'RGBA', the background image is not being pasted correctly causing the subsequent image conversion to RGB to fail.
4. A possible strategy to fix the bug is to correctly paste the image onto the background in the case of 'PNG' and 'RGBA' format.
5. The corrected version of the `convert_image` function is provided below.

## Corrected Version:
```python
# Corrected version of the `convert_image` function
def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
    if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA':
        background = Image.new('RGBA', image.size, (255, 255, 255))
        background.paste(image, (0, 0), image)
        image = background.convert('RGB')
    elif image.mode != 'RGB':
        image = image.convert('RGB')

    if size:
        image = image.copy()
        image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)

    buf = BytesIO()
    image.save(buf, 'JPEG')
    return image, buf
```

By correcting the `paste` method in the 'PNG' and 'RGBA' case to `background.paste(image, (0, 0), image)`, we ensure that the image is pasted onto the background correctly. This correction should fix the bug and allow the function to pass the failing test cases.
