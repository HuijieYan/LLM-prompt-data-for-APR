## Analysis:
1. The buggy function `convert_image` is supposed to handle image conversion and resizing based on certain conditions (e.g., image format and mode).
2. The bug seems to be related to handling PNG images with RGBA mode. When the condition `image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA'` is met, the function tries to convert the image to RGB by creating a new background image with white color and pasting the original image on it.
3. The bug is likely causing incorrect conversion and leading to failures in the provided test cases, especially for PNG images with RGBA mode.
4. To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the conversion logic for PNG images with RGBA mode is correctly implemented and handles transparency properly.

## Correction:
```python
from PIL import Image
from cStringIO import StringIO as BytesIO
from PIL.ImageOps import exif_transpose

class ImagesPipeline(FilesPipeline):
    """
    Abstract pipeline that implement the image thumbnail generation logic
     
    """

    def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
        if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA':
            image = exif_transpose(image)  # Rotate/flip according to EXIF orientation
            background = Image.new('RGBA', image.size, (255, 255, 255, 255)) # Include alpha channel
            background.paste(image, (0, 0), image)
            image = background.convert('RGB')
        elif image.mode != 'RGB':
            image = image.convert('RGB')
        
        if size:
            image = image.copy()
            image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)
        
        buf = BytesIO()
        image.save(buf, 'JPEG')
        return image, buf
```

By adding the `exif_transpose` function to handle EXIF orientation and modifying the logic for converting PNG images with RGBA mode to include the alpha channel in the background image, we can fix the bug in the `convert_image` function. This corrected version should pass the failing test cases provided.
