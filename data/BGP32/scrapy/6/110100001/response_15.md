## Explanation:
The bug in the `convert_image` function is related to the condition that checks if the image format is 'PNG' and mode is 'RGBA'. Within this conditional block, the code attempts to create a new image with a white background and paste the original RGBA image onto it. However, the `paste` method is not used correctly, which results in a `TypeError`.

## Bug Fix:
To fix this bug, we need to correct the usage of the `paste` method by passing the correct parameters. The `paste` method requires a box argument, which is a 4-tuple defining the left, upper, right, and lower pixel coordinate. Additionally, we need to handle the case when the image format is 'PNG' and mode is 'RGBA' properly to convert it to 'RGB'.

Here is the corrected version of the `convert_image` function:

```python
def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
    if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA':
        background = Image.new('RGBA', image.size, (255, 255, 255, 255))
        background.paste(image, (0, 0), image)
        image = background.convert('RGB')
    elif image.mode != 'RGB':
        image = image.convert('RGB')

    if size:
        image = image.copy()
        image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)

    buf = BytesIO()
    image.save(buf, 'JPEG')
    return image, buf
```

With this fix, the `paste` method now correctly takes the image to be pasted as the second argument and the box tuple as the third argument. This ensures that the RGBA image is pasted onto the white background image correctly without triggering any errors. The rest of the function remains the same.
