## Analyzing the buggy function and its relationship with the class, test code:

The provided buggy function `convert_image` is part of the `ImagesPipeline` class, which extends `FilesPipeline`. The purpose of this function is to handle the conversion of images based on certain conditions such as format and mode.

The failing test `test_convert_image` is testing the `convert_image` function with different image scenarios like RGB, RGBA, PNG, and JPEG to verify if the conversions are happening correctly.

## Potential error locations within the buggy function:

1. The condition `if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA'` seems to have an error where it might not always be satisfied due to the case sensitivity of the format and mode. The uppercase 'PNG' and 'RGBA' might cause this condition to fail even when the image is in PNG format and RGBA mode.

2. In the line `background.paste(image, image)`, the second argument should be `(0, 0)` instead of `image`.

3. The conversion to JPEG format using `image.save(buf, 'JPEG')` may cause issues when the original image is in a different format like PNG.

## Explanation of the bug:

The bug in the `convert_image` function occurs due to incorrect handling of conditions for image format and mode, incorrect pasting of the image onto the background, and potential issues with saving the converted image in JPEG format.

## Strategy for fixing the bug:

1. Update the condition to check for lowercase format and mode strings.
2. Change the arguments in the `background.paste()` function to `(0, 0)` instead of `image`.
3. Check the format of the input image before attempting to save it as JPEG to avoid format conversion issues.

## Corrected version of the `convert_image` function:

```python
def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
    if image.format.upper() == 'PNG' and image.mode.upper() == 'RGBA':
        background = Image.new('RGBA', image.size, (255, 255, 255))
        background.paste(image, (0, 0))
        image = background.convert('RGB')
    elif image.mode != 'RGB':
        image = image.convert('RGB')

    if size:
        image = image.copy()
        image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)

    buf = BytesIO()
    image.save(buf, image.format)
    return image, buf
```

By modifying the `convert_image` function based on the suggestions provided above, the bug should be fixed, and the corrected version should pass the failing test scenarios.
