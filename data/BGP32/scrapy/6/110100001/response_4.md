## Analysis:
The buggy function `convert_image` is supposed to convert images to RGB format and resize them if needed. However, there are a couple of issues in the function that are causing it to fail:
1. When checking for PNG format and RGBA mode, the function incorrectly uses `Image.new('RGBA', image.size, (255, 255, 255))` which sets the background to white, and later pastes the image onto this white background. This operation should be correcting transparency issues in the original image, but it actually overwrites the image instead of applying the transparency.
2. When converting to RGB, the function is not correctly handling images with transparency. The transparency level is not considered during the conversion, leading to incorrect RGB values for transparent pixels.

## Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to make sure that transparency is properly handled when converting RGBA images to RGB. We should maintain the alpha channel information during the conversion process. Additionally, we need to update the condition for PNG format and RGBA mode to correctly handle transparency in images.

## Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
    if image.format == 'PNG' and 'A' in image.getbands():
        image = image.convert('RGBA')
        if size:
            image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)
        image = image.convert('RGB')
    elif 'A' in image.getbands():
        image = image.convert('RGBA')
        if size:
            image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)
        image = image.convert('RGB')
    else:
        if size:
            image = image.copy()
            image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)

    buf = BytesIO()
    image.save(buf, 'JPEG')
    return image, buf
```

This corrected version of the function properly handles images with transparency and ensures that converting RGBA images to RGB maintains the alpha channel information.
