### Analysis:
1. The `convert_image` function within the `ImagesPipeline` class is responsible for converting the image format as per the conditions specified in the function.
2. The buggy code contains conditional statements based on the image format and mode but has some issues with the conversion logic for PNG images with RGBA mode.
3. The failing test `test_convert_image` checks different scenarios related to image conversions and sizes based on the image mode and format.
4. The bug is primarily related to the incorrect conversion of PNG images with RGBA mode to RGB mode.

### Bug Explanation:
The bug in the `convert_image` function is related to the handling of PNG images with RGBA mode. When the function encounters a PNG image with RGBA mode, it attempts to create a new RGBA background and paste the image onto it. However, the correct approach should be to convert the RGBA image to RGB mode directly.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to modify the section of code that converts PNG images with RGBA mode to RGB mode. Instead of creating a new RGBA background, we should directly convert the RGBA image to RGB format.

### Corrected Version:
```python
class ImagesPipeline(FilesPipeline):
    def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
        if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA':
            image = image.convert('RGB')  # Fix: Convert RGBA directly to RGB
        elif image.mode != 'RGB':
            image = image.convert('RGB')
        
        if size:
            image = image.copy()
            image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)
        
        buf = BytesIO()
        image.save(buf, 'JPEG')
        return image, buf
```

By making this change, the function now correctly handles PNG images with RGBA mode and should pass the failing test `test_convert_image`.
