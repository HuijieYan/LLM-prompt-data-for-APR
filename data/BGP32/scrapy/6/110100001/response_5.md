## Analysis:
1. The buggy function `convert_image` is part of the `ImagesPipeline` class which extends `FilesPipeline`.
2. The function checks if the image format is PNG and mode is RGBA, it creates a new RGBA image with a white background, pastes the original image on it, and then converts it to RGB. Otherwise, if the mode is not RGB, it converts the image to RGB.
3. The bug is likely present in the condition for PNG and RGBA images as the pasting logic might be incorrect. The failing test case is for PNG and RGBA images with transparency that needs to be handled correctly.
4. To fix the bug, we need to correctly handle the transparency when converting PNG images with RGBA mode to RGB. Ensuring that transparency is preserved during the conversion is essential.

## Bug Fix:
Here is the corrected version of the `convert_image` function:

```python
def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
    if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA':
        background = Image.new('RGBA', image.size, (255, 255, 255, 255))  # Add alpha channel for transparency
        background.paste(image, (0, 0), image)  # Paste image preserving transparency
        image = background.convert('RGB')  # Convert to RGB after preserving transparency
    elif image.mode != 'RGB':
        image = image.convert('RGB')

    if size:
        image = image.copy()
        image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)

    buf = BytesIO()
    image.save(buf, 'JPEG')
    return image, buf
```

With this correction, the image with transparency (PNG and RGBA) will be pasted correctly on a white background while maintaining the transparency. The corrected function addresses the bug and should pass the failing test case.
