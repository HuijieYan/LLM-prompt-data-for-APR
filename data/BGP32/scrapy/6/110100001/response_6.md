## Analysis:
1. The `convert_image` function in the `ImagesPipeline` class is responsible for converting images to a specified format and size.
2. The potential error locations in the buggy function include the conditions for checking the image format and mode, as well as the conversion logic based on those conditions.
3. The bug appears to be in the condition for checking PNG format and RGBA mode, where it incorrectly converts the image to RGB format without considering the transparency channel.
4. To fix the bug, we need to handle the RGBA mode correctly by preserving transparency while converting the image to RGB format.
5. Let's provide a corrected version of the `convert_image` function below:

## Corrected Version:
```python
def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
    if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA':
        background = Image.new('RGBA', image.size, (255, 255, 255, 255))
        background.paste(image, (0, 0), image)
        image = background.convert('RGB')
    elif image.mode != 'RGB':
        image = image.convert('RGB')

    if size:
        image = image.copy()
        image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)

    buf = BytesIO()
    image.save(buf, 'JPEG')
    return image, buf
```

By updating the condition for handling PNG format and RGBA mode, and properly preserving transparency while converting images, the corrected version of the function should pass the failing test.
