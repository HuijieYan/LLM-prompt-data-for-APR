## Analysis:
1. The `convert_image` function within the `ImagesPipeline` class is intended to process images by converting them to RGB format and generating thumbnails if a size is provided.
2. The function has conditional statements to handle PNG images in RGBA format by creating a white background and converting the image to RGB format.
3. The failing test is checking for the correct mode and color values after the conversion, which is failing due to incorrect handling of RGBA images.
4. The bug is caused by incorrect pasting of the RGBA image onto the white background, leading to incorrect color values in the resulting image.
5. To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the RGBA image is properly pasted onto the white background before conversion to RGB and thumbnail generation.

## Bug Fix:
```python
def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
        if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA':
            background = Image.new('RGBA', image.size, (255, 255, 255, 255))
            background.paste(image, (0, 0), image)
            image = background.convert('RGB')
        elif image.mode != 'RGB':
            image = image.convert('RGB')
    
        if size:
            image = image.copy()
            image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)
    
        buf = BytesIO()
        image.save(buf, 'JPEG')
        return image, buf
```

With this fix, the RGBA image is correctly pasted onto the white background before conversion to RGB, ensuring that the resulting image has the correct color values. This corrected version should pass the failing test.
