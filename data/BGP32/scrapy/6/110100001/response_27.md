## Analysis:
1. The `convert_image` function in the `ImagesPipeline` class is responsible for converting images and applying certain transformations based on their format and mode.
2. The buggy part of the function checks if the image format is 'PNG' and mode is 'RGBA', then creates a new background image and pastes the original image on the background. However, the `paste` method should be used with coordinates not the image itself, causing the bug.
3. The bug is causing the image conversion to fail when the format is 'PNG' and mode is 'RGBA', as observed in the failing test case where the converted image does not match the expected output.
4. To fix the bug, we need to correct the way the image is pasted onto the background image by providing the coordinates of the pasted image.
5. The corrected version of the function is provided below.

## Corrected Version:
```python
def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
    if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA':
        background = Image.new('RGBA', image.size, (255, 255, 255))
        background.paste(image, (0, 0), image)
        image = background.convert('RGB')
    elif image.mode != 'RGB':
        image = image.convert('RGB')

    if size:
        image = image.copy()
        image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)

    buf = BytesIO()
    image.save(buf, 'JPEG')
    return image, buf
```

With this corrected version, the image is pasted onto the background image with the correct coordinates, thus fixing the bug and passing the failing test.
