## Analysis:
1. The `convert_image` function in the `ImagesPipeline` class is intended to convert an image to RGB format and generate a thumbnail if a size is specified.
2. The potential error locations in the function are:
   - Incorrect handling of PNG images with RGBA mode.
   - Incorrect handling of image conversion to RGB format.
   - Incorrect saving of the image as JPEG.
3. The bug is likely caused by incorrect handling of PNG images with RGBA mode, resulting in the background not being pasted properly and leading to an incorrect image conversion.
4. To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the background is pasted properly for PNG images with RGBA mode, and correctly handle the conversion to RGB format before generating the thumbnail and saving the image as JPEG.

## Fix:

```python
def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
    if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA':
        background = Image.new('RGB', image.size, (255, 255, 255))
        background.paste(image, (0, 0), image)
        image = background
    elif image.mode != 'RGB':
        image = image.convert('RGB')

    if size:
        image = image.copy()
        image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)

    buf = BytesIO()
    image.save(buf, 'JPEG')
    return image, buf
```

With this correction, the function properly handles PNG images with RGBA mode by creating a new RGB image with a white background, pasting the original image onto the background, and converting the image to RGB format. It then generates the thumbnail if a size is specified and saves the image as JPEG. This corrected version should pass the failing test.
