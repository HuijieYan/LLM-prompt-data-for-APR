After analyzing the given buggy function `convert_image`, the issue seems to be in the conditional statement that checks for the image format and mode. The bug is likely caused by an incorrect condition check and improper handling of transparency in RGBA images when converting them to RGB.

Here is the fixed version of the `convert_image` function:

```python
from PIL import Image
from cStringIO import StringIO as BytesIO
from scrapy.pipelines.files import FilesPipeline

class ImagesPipeline(FilesPipeline):
    """
    Abstract pipeline that implements image thumbnail generation logic.

        
    """

    def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
        if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA':
            background = Image.new('RGBA', image.size, (255, 255, 255, 255))
            background.paste(image, (0, 0), image)
            image = background.convert('RGB')
        elif image.mode != 'RGB':
            image = image.convert('RGB')

        if size:
            image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)

        buf = BytesIO()
        image.save(buf, 'JPEG')
        return image, buf
```

The changes made in the fixed version include:
1. Fixed the condition check for PNG format and RGBA mode by creating a new RGBA background with full transparency.
2. Corrected the paste operation by providing the correct paste coordinates.
3. Ensured that the pasted image is properly converted to RGB.
4. Updated the conversion of non-RGB images to RGB if necessary.

By applying these changes, the `convert_image` function should now correctly handle PNG images with transparency and convert them to RGB format while preserving the image ratio and quality. This should address the bugs present in the original implementation and allow the function to pass the failing test cases.
