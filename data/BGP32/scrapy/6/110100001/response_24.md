## Analysis:
The `convert_image` function in the `ImagesPipeline` class is supposed to convert an image to RGB format and generate a thumbnail of a specified size. However, the function has a bug where it incorrectly handles PNG images with RGBA mode. The bug occurs when the image format is PNG and the mode is RGBA, where it mistakenly converts the image to RGB format without considering the transparency.

## Identified issue:
The bug lies in the conditional check for PNG images with RGBA mode. The code pastes the image on a new background with a white color before converting it to RGB. However, since RGBA images have transparency, pasting them on a white background can affect the transparency values.

## Cause of the bug:
The bug occurs because the code does not handle transparent pixels properly when converting PNG images with RGBA mode to RGB. When the image is pasted on a white background, the transparency information is lost, leading to incorrect conversion and thumbnail generation.

## Strategy for fixing the bug:
To fix the bug, we need to handle PNG images with RGBA mode differently to preserve the transparency information. One possible approach is to create a new image of RGBA mode and paste the original image onto it instead of using a white background. This way, the transparency values will be maintained during the conversion process.

## Corrected version of the function:
Here is a corrected version of the `convert_image` function:

```python
    def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
        if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA':
            background = Image.new('RGBA', image.size, (0, 0, 0, 0))  # Create a transparent background
            background.paste(image, (0, 0), image)
            image = background.convert('RGB')
        elif image.mode != 'RGB':
            image = image.convert('RGB')
    
        if size:
            image = image.copy()
            image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)
    
        buf = BytesIO()
        image.save(buf, 'JPEG')
        return image, buf
```

In this corrected version, we create a transparent background for PNG images with RGBA mode, ensuring that the transparency values are preserved during the conversion. This fix should address the bug and make the function behave correctly for PNG images with RGBA mode.
