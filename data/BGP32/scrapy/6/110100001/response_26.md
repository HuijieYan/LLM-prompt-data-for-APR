## Analysis:
- The `convert_image` function is part of the `ImagesPipeline` class, which inherits from `FilesPipeline`.
- The function checks the format and mode of the image and performs some conversions.
- The bug seems to be related to the handling of PNG images with RGBA mode.

## Potential error locations:
1. The condition `if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA'` could be causing the issue with PNG images in RGBA mode.
2. The conversion logic inside the if condition may have a bug.

## Cause of the bug:
The bug seems to be in the handling of PNG images with RGBA mode. The code is trying to convert the RGBA image to RGB by creating a new RGBA background and pasting the image on it. However, the paste operation might not be working as expected. This results in the conversion not happening correctly, leading to the failing tests.

## Strategy for fixing the bug:
To fix the bug, we should ensure that the conversion of PNG images with RGBA mode to RGB is done correctly. We need to handle transparency properly and ensure that the conversion maintains the image quality.

## Corrected version of the function:
```python
def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
    if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA':
        background = Image.new('RGB', image.size, (255, 255, 255))
        background.paste(image, (0, 0), image)
        image = background
    elif image.mode != 'RGB':
        image = image.convert('RGB')

    if size:
        image = image.copy()
        image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)

    buf = BytesIO()
    image.save(buf, 'JPEG')
    return image, buf
```

In the corrected version, the background paste operation for PNG images with RGBA mode is corrected to ensure proper conversion to RGB. The corrected function should now pass the failing tests.
