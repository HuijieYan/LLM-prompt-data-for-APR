## Analysis:
The buggy function `convert_image` is part of the `ImagesPipeline` class in the `scrapy/pipelines/images.py` file. The function is responsible for converting images to RGB and resizing them if required. The function is failing the test case `test_convert_image`, specifically when dealing with PNG images in RGBA mode.

## Identified Error:
The bug occurs when the function encounters a PNG image in RGBA mode. It attempts to convert it to RGB by pasting the image onto a new RGBA background first, and then converting the background to RGB. However, the correct approach should be to convert the RGBA image directly to RGB without creating a new background image.

## Cause of the Bug:
The bug is caused by the incorrect handling of PNG images in RGBA mode. By creating a new RGBA background and then converting it to RGB, the original transparency information of the image is lost, resulting in an incorrect conversion.

## Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, the function should directly convert the image from RGBA to RGB without creating a new background. This will preserve the original transparency information of the image.

## Corrected Version:
```python
def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
    if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA':
        image = image.convert('RGB')
    elif image.mode != 'RGB':
        image = image.convert('RGB')

    if size:
        image = image.copy()
        image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)

    buf = BytesIO()
    image.save(buf, 'JPEG')
    return image, buf
```

By directly converting the PNG image from RGBA to RGB without creating a new background, the bug should be fixed and the function should now pass the failing test.
