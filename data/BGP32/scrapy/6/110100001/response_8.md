## Analyzing the buggy function and its relationship with the test code:

The buggy function `convert_image` is part of the `ImagesPipeline` class, which is an abstract pipeline implementing image thumbnail generation logic. The function checks the format and mode of the input image and converts it to RGB format while handling RGBA and PNG images specifically. The function also resizes the image if a `size` parameter is provided.

The failing test `test_convert_image` tests the `convert_image` function by creating images with different formats and modes and checking if the function properly converts the images to RGB and resizes them if needed.

## Error locations within the buggy function:
1. Incorrect paste operation for RGBA images.
2. Incorrect handling of the JPEG format conversion.

## Cause of the bug:
The bug is primarily caused by the incorrect paste operation for RGBA images:
```python
background.paste(image, image)
```
This line should be corrected to:
```python
background.paste(image, (0, 0), image)
```
Additionally, the incorrect handling of the JPEG format conversion where the image is saved as JPEG without checking the original format can lead to unexpected behavior.

## Strategy for fixing the bug:
1. Correct the paste operation for RGBA images by specifying the position as `(0, 0)` when pasting the image onto the background.
2. Add a check for the original image format before saving it as JPEG to maintain the original format if it's not JPEG.

## Corrected version of the buggy function:
```python
def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
    if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA':
        background = Image.new('RGBA', image.size, (255, 255, 255))
        background.paste(image, (0, 0), image)
        image = background.convert('RGB')
    elif image.mode != 'RGB':
        image = image.convert('RGB')
    
    if size:
        image = image.copy()
        image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)
    
    if image.format != 'JPEG':
        format = 'JPEG' if image.format else 'PNG'
        buf = BytesIO()
        image.save(buf, format)
    else:
        buf = BytesIO()
        image.save(buf, 'JPEG')
    
    return image, buf
```

By correcting the paste operation for RGBA images and adding a check for the original image format before saving it as JPEG, the corrected version of the `convert_image` function should now pass the failing test.
