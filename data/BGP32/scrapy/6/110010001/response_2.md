### Analysis:
- The `convert_image` function in the `ImagesPipeline` class is responsible for converting images into the desired format and size.
- The function contains logic to handle images of different formats and modes.
- The failing test is trying to convert a PNG image with RGBA mode to RGB mode and compare the colors of the converted image with the expected colors.

### Bugs Identified:
1. The condition for checking if the image format is PNG and mode is RGBA has an incorrect capitalization. It should be lowercase.
2. When pasting the original image onto the background image, the `paste` method should be called with `(0, 0)` coordinates, not `image`.

### Cause of the Bug:
The bug is caused by the incorrect handling of the RGBA mode image conversion to RGB mode. The incorrect call to the `paste` method causes the image to not be properly pasted onto the background.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
1. Correct the condition for image format and mode checking.
2. Adjust the `paste` method call to paste the image at the correct position.

### Corrected Version:
```python
class ImagesPipeline(FilesPipeline):
    """
    Abstract pipeline that implement the image thumbnail generation logic
    
        
    """

    def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
        if image.format.lower() == 'png' and image.mode == 'RGBA':
            background = Image.new('RGBA', image.size, (255, 255, 255))
            background.paste(image, (0, 0))
            image = background.convert('RGB')
        elif image.mode != 'RGB':
            image = image.convert('RGB')
    
        if size:
            image = image.copy()
            image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)
    
        buf = BytesIO()
        image.save(buf, 'JPEG')
        return image, buf
```

This corrected version fixes the bugs and should pass the failing test mentioned in the error message.
