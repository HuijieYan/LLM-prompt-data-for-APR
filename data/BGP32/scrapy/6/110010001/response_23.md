### Analysis:
1. The `convert_image` function within the `ImagesPipeline` class is responsible for converting images to the desired format and size.
2. The function checks if the image is PNG with RGBA mode and converts it to RGB if true, otherwise converts it to RGB if it's not already in RGB mode.
3. The error message indicates a failing test case where the converted image's colors do not match the expected values.
4. The bug seems to be related to the conversion process for PNG images with transparency.
   
### Bug:
- The bug is caused by the incorrect handling of PNG images with RGBA mode and transparency. The conversion logic is not correctly mapping the RGBA colors to RGB colors, leading to a mismatch in the converted image's colors compared to the expected values.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
- Adjust the conversion logic for PNG images with RGBA mode to correctly handle transparency while converting colors from RGBA to RGB.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
    if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA':
        background = Image.new('RGBA', image.size, (255, 255, 255, 255))  # Added alpha channel for background
        background.paste(image, image)
        image = background.convert('RGB')
    elif image.mode != 'RGB':
        image = image.convert('RGB')

    if size:
        image = image.copy()
        image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)

    buf = BytesIO()
    image.save(buf, 'JPEG')

    return image, buf
```

By explicitly setting the alpha channel value for the background in PNG images with RGBA mode during conversion, the colors should be correctly converted to RGB while preserving the transparency information. This should fix the bug and ensure that the converted images match the expected colors in the test cases.
