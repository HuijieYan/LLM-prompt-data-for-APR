### Analysis:
The buggy function `convert_image` is responsible for converting images to a target format and resizing them if necessary. The function checks the format and mode of the image and performs conversions accordingly. The bug is likely occurring in the condition where the image format is 'PNG' and mode is 'RGBA'. In this case, the function creates a new RGBA background and pastes the image onto it, intending to remove transparency. However, the bug originates from the incorrect argument passed to the `paste` method.

### Potential Error Location:
The bug is likely in the line `background.paste(image, image)`. The correct syntax for the `paste` method is `image.paste(im, box)`, where `image` is the source image and `im` is the image to be pasted.

### Bug Cause:
The bug causes the RGBA image to remain unchanged because the incorrect usage of `paste` method prevents the desired operation of removing transparency.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to correctly paste the original image onto the white background in the RGBA conversion block. This can be achieved by passing the correct arguments to the `paste` method - the original image and the box representing the entire size of the image.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
    if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA':
        background = Image.new('RGBA', image.size, (255, 255, 255))
        background.paste(image, (0, 0, image.size[0], image.size[1]))  # Corrected paste method usage
        image = background.convert('RGB')
    elif image.mode != 'RGB':
        image = image.convert('RGB')

    if size:
        image = image.copy()
        image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)

    buf = BytesIO()
    image.save(buf, 'JPEG')
    return image, buf
```

By correcting the `paste` method usage with the appropriate arguments, the bug causing the image to remain unchanged when converting from RGBA to RGB format is fixed.
