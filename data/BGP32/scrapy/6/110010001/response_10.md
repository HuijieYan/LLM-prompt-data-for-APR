### Analysis:
1. The `convert_image` function is responsible for converting images to the appropriate format and size. The function takes an image and an optional size parameter, then processes the image accordingly.
2. The error message indicates that there is a discrepancy in the colors of the converted image compared to the expected colors. This suggests there might be an issue with the conversion logic implemented in the function.
3. The bug is likely related to the handling of transparency when converting RGBA images to RGB format. The failing test case involves an image with transparency, and the colors are not being transformed correctly during the conversion process.
4. To fix the bug, we need to ensure that when converting RGBA images to RGB, the transparency is handled appropriately, and the colors are adjusted accordingly.
5. The conversion logic needs to account for the alpha channel when dealing with RGBA images to prevent color discrepancies.

### Fix:
```python
def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
    if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA':
        background = Image.new('RGBA', image.size, (255, 255, 255, 255))  # Include alpha for background
        background.paste(image, image)
        image = background.convert('RGB')
    elif image.mode != 'RGB':
        image = image.convert('RGB')

    if size:
        image = image.copy()
        image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)

    if image.mode == 'RGB' and 'A' in image.getbands():  # Check if image has alpha channel
        image = image.convert('RGBA')  # Convert to RGBA to handle transparency

    buf = BytesIO()
    image.save(buf, 'JPEG')
    return image, buf
```

By explicitly checking if the image has an alpha channel and converting it to RGBA if needed, we can handle transparency correctly during the image conversion process. This corrected version of the `convert_image` function should now pass the failing test case.
