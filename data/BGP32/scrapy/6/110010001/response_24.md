### Analysis:
- The buggy function `convert_image` is part of the `ImagesPipeline` class, which is a subclass of `FilesPipeline`.
- The error message indicates that the test is failing due to a difference in the colors of the images (specifically RGB values) after conversion.
- The buggy function seems to be incorrectly handling the conversion of images with transparency (RGBA) to RGB format.

### Potential Error Locations:
1. The conditional block handling PNG images with RGBA mode might not be correctly converting the image to RGB.
2. The logic for converting images from RGBA to RGB might be incorrect.

### Cause of the Bug:
The bug in the `convert_image` function arises from mishandling the conversion of images with transparency (RGBA) to RGB format. The buggy code incorrectly converts the RGBA image without properly handling transparency, leading to differences in the image colors.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the conversion of images from RGBA to RGB properly handles transparency. This can be achieved by creating a new RGBA image with a white background before converting it to RGB to preserve the transparency data.

### Corrected Version:
Here is the corrected version of the `convert_image` function:

```python
def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
    if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA':
        background = Image.new('RGBA', image.size, (255, 255, 255, 255))  # Create RGBA image with white background
        background.paste(image, (0, 0), image)  # Paste the original image on the white background
        image = background.convert('RGB')
    elif image.mode != 'RGB':
        image = image.convert('RGB')

    if size:
        image = image.copy()
        image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)

    buf = BytesIO()
    image.save(buf, 'JPEG')
    return image, buf
```

In this corrected version:
- We create a new RGBA image with a white background that matches the size of the original image during the conversion from PNG RGBA to RGB.
- We paste the original image onto the white background to preserve transparency.
- This modification ensures that transparency is correctly handled during the conversion process, resolving the bug.
