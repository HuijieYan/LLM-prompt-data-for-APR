#### Analysis:
The `convert_image` function is failing the test due to the conversion of images with RGBA mode and PNG format. The function is expected to convert these images to RGB mode and save them as JPEG images. However, the current implementation is not handling the RGBA mode conversion correctly, resulting in an incorrect output.

#### Error Location:
The key error location is the condition that checks for RGBA mode and PNG format, where the image is required to be converted to RGB mode and saved as a JPEG image.

#### Bug Cause:
The bug is caused by incorrect handling of images with RGBA mode and PNG format in the `convert_image` function. The function does not correctly convert RGBA images to RGB mode, leading to a mismatch in the test results and the expected output.

#### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
1. Check the condition for RGBA mode and PNG format in the function.
2. When the condition is met, create a new RGB mode image with a white background and paste the original image onto it before converting it to RGB format.
3. This method ensures that the transparency of the original image is preserved during the conversion.

#### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
    if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA':
        background = Image.new('RGBA', image.size, (255, 255, 255))
        background.paste(image, (0, 0), image)
        image = background.convert('RGB')
    elif image.mode != 'RGB':
        image = image.convert('RGB')

    if size:
        image = image.copy()
        image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)

    buf = BytesIO()
    image.save(buf, 'JPEG')
    return image, buf
``` 

By correctly pasting the original RGBA image onto a new RGB image with a white background, we ensure that the transparency is preserved during the conversion process.
