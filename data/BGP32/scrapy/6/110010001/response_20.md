### Analysis:
1. The `convert_image` function is responsible for converting an image to the desired format and size.
2. The function checks if the image format is 'PNG' and the mode is 'RGBA', it creates a new background with white color, pastes the image on it, and converts it to 'RGB'.
3. The bug occurs when the function attempts to compare the converted colors of the images with the expected colors. The bug is likely related to the conversion logic in the function.
4. The bug can be fixed by ensuring correct color conversion and handling.
  
### Bug Explanation:
The bug occurs when converting an RGBA image to RGB format. The function is not correctly handling the alpha channel during the conversion process. It is assuming a white background but not taking into account the transparency of the original image.

### Bug Fix:
To fix the bug, we need to modify the `convert_image` function to properly handle images with transparency. We should create a new image with a white background ignoring the alpha channel but preserving the original RGB values. 

### Corrected Version:
```python
def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
    if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA':
        background = Image.new('RGB', image.size, (255, 255, 255))
        background.paste(image, (0, 0), image)
        image = background
    elif image.mode != 'RGB':
        image = image.convert('RGB')

    if size:
        image = image.copy()
        image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)

    buf = BytesIO()
    image.save(buf, 'JPEG')
    return image, buf
```

By modifying the code as suggested above, it should correctly handle RGBA to RGB conversion for PNG images with transparency. After applying this fix, the failing test should pass successfully.
