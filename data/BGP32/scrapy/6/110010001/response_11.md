1. Analysis:
   - The buggy function `convert_image` is a method of the `ImagesPipeline` class, which is a subclass of `FilesPipeline`.
   - The error message is indicating that the converted image is not matching the expected RGB color values.
   
2. Potential error locations:
   - In the conditional block where it checks for 'PNG' format and 'RGBA' mode.
   - In the part where it converts the image to RGB mode.
   - In the thumbnail creation process.

3. Cause of the bug:
   - The bug is likely caused by the way the image with PNG format and RGBA mode is handled. The conversion to RGB may not be processing the transparency values correctly, leading to differences in the color values.
   
4. Strategy for fixing the bug:
   - When dealing with PNG format images with RGBA mode, handle the transparency values properly to ensure accurate conversion to RGB.
   - Check if the transparency values are affecting the RGB conversion and thumbnail creation process.
   
5. Corrected version of the function:

```python
class ImagesPipeline(FilesPipeline):
    def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
        if image.format == 'PNG' and 'A' in image.mode:  # Check for Alpha channel
            background = Image.new('RGB', image.size, (255, 255, 255))
            background.paste(image, image)
            image = background
        elif image.mode != 'RGB':
            image = image.convert('RGB')

        if size:
            image = image.copy()
            image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)

        buf = BytesIO()
        image.save(buf, 'JPEG')
        return image, buf
```

With this corrected version, the function will properly handle PNG images with RGBA mode by converting them to RGB while preserving the transparency values. This should fix the color discrepancies observed in the failing test.
