### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `convert_image` within the `ImagesPipeline` class is responsible for converting images to the desired format and size.
2. The error message indicates a failure in the test related to the conversion of images with transparency.
3. The bug is likely caused by the incorrect handling of images with transparency and the conversion to RGB format.
4. The strategy for fixing the bug involves correctly handling images with transparency by creating a white background for RGBA PNG images before converting them to RGB format.

### Correction:
```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: scrapy/pipelines/images.py

from PIL import Image
from cStringIO import StringIO as BytesIO

class ImagesPipeline(FilesPipeline):
    """
    Abstract pipeline that implement the image thumbnail generation logic
    """

    def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
        if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA':
            background = Image.new('RGBA', image.size, (255, 255, 255, 255))  # Add alpha value for RGBA
            background.paste(image, (0, 0), image)  # Specify the image to paste
            image = background.convert('RGB')
        elif image.mode != 'RGB':
            image = image.convert('RGB')
        
        if size:
            image = image.copy()
            image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)
        
        buf = BytesIO()
        image.save(buf, 'JPEG')
        return image, buf
```

### Explanation:
1. In the corrected version, when the image format is PNG and mode is RGBA, a white background with transparency is created to maintain the transparency of the original image.
2. The original image is then pasted onto this white background before converting it to RGB format.
3. This approach ensures that images with transparency are correctly converted to RGB without losing their transparency information.
4. By correctly handling images with transparency, the bug causing the test to fail has been addressed.
