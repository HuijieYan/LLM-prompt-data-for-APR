### Analysis:
The `convert_image` function is responsible for converting images to the desired format and size. The error message indicates that there is a failure when converting images with transparency (mode 'RGBA') to RGB mode. The failing test checks if the converted image colors are as expected, but the conversion logic is incorrect for images with transparency.

### Potential Error Locations:
1. Incorrect handling of images with transparency (mode 'RGBA').
2. Conversion logic needs to be adjusted to handle transparency correctly.

### Cause of the Bug:
The bug occurs when converting images with transparency (mode 'RGBA') to RGB mode. The conversion process in the provided function is not correctly handling transparency, leading to incorrect color values in the converted image. This discrepancy causes the failing test to compare unexpected color values.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to adjust the conversion logic to handle images with transparency correctly. When dealing with RGBA images, the transparency needs to be taken into account to ensure the converted RGB image is accurate. By updating the logic to handle transparency, we can ensure the RGB conversion produces the expected output.

### Corrected Version:
Here is the corrected `convert_image` function:

```python
def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
    if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA':
        background = Image.new('RGB', image.size, (255, 255, 255))
        background.paste(image, (0, 0), image)
        image = background
    elif image.mode != 'RGB':
        image = image.convert('RGB')

    if size:
        image = image.copy()
        image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)

    buf = BytesIO()
    image.save(buf, 'JPEG')
    return image, buf
```

In this corrected version, when dealing with PNG images in RGBA mode, we create a new RGB image with a white background and paste the RGBA image onto it, taking transparency into account. This adjustment ensures that the transparency is correctly handled during the conversion process, resulting in accurate color values in the converted RGB image.
