### Analysis:
The `convert_image` function is responsible for converting images to a specified format and size. Looking at the error message, it seems that there is a discrepancy in the color values of the converted image. The failing test indicates that the converted image is not matching the expected RGB color values.

### Potential Error Locations:
1. The conditional checks for PNG format and RGBA mode might not be handling transparency properly.
2. Converting the image to RGB might be affecting the color values.
3. The thumbnail resizing process might be altering the image properties.

### Cause of the Bug:
The bug is likely caused by not properly handling transparency in the images. When converting PNG images with an RGBA mode to RGB, the transparency is not considered, leading to a difference in color values and failing the test.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
1. Properly handle transparency when converting PNG images with RGBA mode to RGB.
2. Ensure that the thumbnail resizing process does not alter the color values of the image.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
 def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
        if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA':
            background = Image.new('RGB', image.size, (255, 255, 255))
            background.paste(image, (0, 0), image)
            image = background.convert('RGB')
        elif image.mode != 'RGB':
            image = image.convert('RGB')

        if size:
            image = image.copy()
            image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)

        buf = BytesIO()
        image.save(buf, 'JPEG')
        return image, buf
```

This corrected version ensures that the transparency of PNG images with an RGBA mode is properly handled when converting to RGB. Additionally, it maintains the color values during the resizing process.
