### Analysis:
1. The `convert_image` function is intended to handle image processing, including converting formats and resizing images. However, the function seems to have a bug in handling PNG images with an RGBA format.
2. The bug seems to be related to handling transparency in the image.
3. The error message indicates that the conversion of an RGBA image to RGB is not correctly producing the expected result, resulting in a failure when comparing the colors of the image.
4. To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the transparent parts of the RGBA image are handled correctly during conversion.
5. Potential strategy for fixing the bug:
   - Check the conditional statements related to RGBA images and transparency handling.
   - Ensure that the transparent parts of the image are handled properly during conversion.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
    if image.format.upper() == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA':  # Fix: Ensure format comparison is case-insensitive
        background = Image.new('RGB', image.size, (255, 255, 255))  # Fix: Change mode to 'RGB'
        background.paste(image, image)
        image = background
    elif image.mode != 'RGB':
        image = image.convert('RGB')
    
    if size:
        image = image.copy()
        image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)
    
    buf = BytesIO()
    image.save(buf, 'JPEG')
    return image, buf
```

By correcting the conditional statement for handling PNG RGBA images and ensuring the correct mode and background color during conversion, the bug should be fixed. This corrected version should now pass the failing test.
