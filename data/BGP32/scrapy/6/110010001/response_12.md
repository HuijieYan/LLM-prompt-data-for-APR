### Analysis:
The buggy function `convert_image` is part of the `ImagesPipeline` class, which inherits from `FilesPipeline`. The function is responsible for converting an image to a specified size and format.

The error message indicates that the conversion of an image with RGBA mode and PNG format is resulting in a wrong color after conversion. This leads to a failing test when checking the color values.

### Potential Error Locations:
1. The conditional block for handling RGBA mode and PNG format images might not be correctly converting the image to RGB mode.
2. There could be an issue with the color conversion logic for RGBA mode images.

### Bug Cause:
The bug occurs when the function is converting an image with RGBA mode and PNG format to RGB mode. The way the conversion is handled leads to incorrect color values in the resulting image, causing the test to fail. This is evident from the error message showing a mismatch in color values after the conversion.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the conversion of images with RGBA mode and PNG format is correctly handled to maintain the color integrity of the image. This involves adjusting the conversion logic and ensuring that the color values are preserved during the process.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
class ImagesPipeline(FilesPipeline):
    def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
        if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA':
            background = Image.new('RGBA', image.size, (255, 255, 255))
            background.paste(image, (0, 0), image)
            image = background.convert('RGB')
        elif image.mode != 'RGB':
            image = image.convert('RGB')
        
        if size:
            image = image.copy()
            image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)
        
        buf = BytesIO()
        image.save(buf, 'JPEG')
        return image, buf
```

In the corrected version, the adjustment is made in the RGBA mode and PNG format conversion block. Specifically, the `background.paste(image, image)` call is changed to `background.paste(image, (0, 0), image)` to paste the image correctly with the specified position. This modification ensures that the conversion maintains the original color values in the resulting RGB image.

This correction should address the bug and make the function behave correctly, passing the failing test.
