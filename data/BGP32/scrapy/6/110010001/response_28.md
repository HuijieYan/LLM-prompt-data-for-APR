### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `convert_image` takes an image and an optional size parameter, converts the image to RGB format, resizes it if a size is provided, and then saves it as a JPEG file.
2. The error message indicates that the test failed because the RGB values of the converted image are not as expected in the test case.
3. The bug is likely related to the conversion logic for images with transparency (RGBA).
4. The bug seems to be in the logic where it converts images with transparency to RGB format. This logic is incorrect, leading to incorrect RGB values in the converted image.
   
### Bug Cause:
When the function encounters an image with PNG format and RGBA mode, it creates a new RGBA image with a white background, then pastes the original image onto this new image. However, when doing so, the original image should be specified as the second argument to the `paste` method (not the first, as the code currently stands). This incorrect usage causes the RGBA values to be interpreted as RGB values, leading to incorrect conversions.

### Bug Fix:
To fix the bug, the correct image should be passed as the second argument to the `paste` method. This way, the transparency information from the original image is preserved during the conversion process.

### Updated Function:
```python
class ImagesPipeline(FilesPipeline):
    def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
        if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA':
            background = Image.new('RGBA', image.size, (255, 255, 255))
            background.paste(image, (0, 0), image)
            image = background.convert('RGB')
        elif image.mode != 'RGB':
            image = image.convert('RGB')
    
        if size:
            image = image.copy()
            image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)
    
        buf = BytesIO()
        image.save(buf, 'JPEG')
        return image, buf
```

By correcting the usage of the `paste` function, we ensure that the transparency information is retained during the conversion process, leading to correct RGB values in the converted image.
