### Analysis:
1. The provided `convert_image` function is designed to handle image conversion, specifically dealing with different image modes and formats.
2. The error message indicates a failure in the test case checking the color values after conversion.
3. The bug is likely related to the conversion logic based on the image mode and format, which is causing incorrect color values during the conversion.
4. The bug seems to be specifically related to the handling of PNG images with RGBA mode and transparency.
5. To fix the bug, the conversion logic for PNG images with RGBA mode needs to be adjusted to ensure the correct color values are retained.

### Fixing the Bug:
```python
def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
    if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA':
        background = Image.new('RGBA', image.size, (255, 255, 255, 255))
        background.paste(image, (0, 0), image)
        image = background.convert('RGB')
    elif image.mode != 'RGB':
        image = image.convert('RGB')

    if size:
        image = image.copy()
        image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)

    buf = BytesIO()
    image.save(buf, 'JPEG')
    return image, buf
```

### Changes Made:
1. Updated the background creation for PNG images with RGBA mode to include an alpha channel (RGBA) to preserve transparency.
2. Adjusted the `background.paste()` method to correctly paste the image while retaining the alpha channel.
3. Now the conversion should handle RGBA PNG images with transparency correctly while preserving the color values.

By making these changes, the corrected version of the `convert_image` function should pass the failing test case successfully.
