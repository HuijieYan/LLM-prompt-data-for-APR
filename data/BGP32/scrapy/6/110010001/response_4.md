### Analysis
The error message indicates that there is an issue with the color values of the converted image. The test is failing because the expected color values do not match the actual color values after conversion. This discrepancy suggests that the `convert_image` function is not correctly handling the conversion of images with transparency.

### Potential Error Locations
1. Handling of PNG images with RGBA mode.
2. Conversion of RGBA mode to RGB mode.
3. Handling transparency while converting images.

### Cause of the Bug
The bug is likely caused by the incorrect handling of transparency in images when converting from RGBA mode to RGB mode. The function currently does not preserve the transparent areas of the image, which leads to discrepancies in the color values after conversion.

### Fixing the Bug
To fix the bug, we need to modify the function to properly handle transparency when converting images. This can be achieved by creating a new RGB image with a white background and then pasting the original image on top of it using the alpha channel. This will preserve transparency during the conversion.

### Corrected Version
Here is the corrected version of the `convert_image` function:

```python
def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
    if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA':
        background = Image.new('RGBA', image.size, (255, 255, 255, 255))
        background.paste(image, image)
        image = background.convert('RGB')
    elif image.mode != 'RGB':
        image = image.convert('RGB')
    
    if size:
        image = image.copy()
        image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)
    
    buf = BytesIO()
    image.save(buf, 'JPEG')
    return image, buf
```

This corrected version ensures that transparency is preserved during the conversion process. The function now creates a new RGBA image with a white background, pastes the original RGBA image on top of it, and then converts the result to RGB mode. This approach should address the bug and make the function work correctly for images with transparency.
