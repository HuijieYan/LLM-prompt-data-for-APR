### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `convert_image` is inside the `ImagesPipeline` class. 
2. The function attempts to convert images to a specified format and size. 
3. The error message indicates a failure in comparing the colors of converted images.
4. The bug seems to be related to the handling of transparency and converting RGBA images to RGB.

### Bug Cause:
The bug occurs because when converting RGBA images to RGB, the transparency information is lost. This leads to incorrect color comparisons later in the test.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
1. Check if the image has an alpha channel (transparency) before converting it to RGB.
2. If the image is RGBA, handle transparency appropriately.

### Corrected Version:
```python
class ImagesPipeline(FilesPipeline):
    """
    Abstract pipeline that implement the image thumbnail generation logic
    """

    def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
        if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA':
            # Check if image has alpha channel
            if 'A' in image.getbands():
                background = Image.new('RGBA', image.size, (255, 255, 255))
                background.paste(image, image)
                image = background.convert('RGB')
            else:
                image = image.convert('RGB')
        elif 'A' in image.getbands() and image.mode != "RGB":
            image = image.convert('RGB')

        if size:
            image = image.copy()
            image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)

        buf = BytesIO()
        image.save(buf, 'JPEG')
        return image, buf
```

This corrected version of the `convert_image` function first checks if the image has an alpha channel before converting it to RGB. It ensures that transparency information is retained appropriately during the conversion process.
