### Analysis:
- The buggy function `convert_image` in the `ImagesPipeline` class is responsible for converting images to JPEG format for further processing in the pipeline.
- The error message indicates that the test is failing due to a mismatch in the colors of the converted image.
- The buggy function has a conditional statement that converts RGBA PNG images to RGB format, but there is an issue with how it handles transparency.
- When dealing with RGBA images, the transparency information is lost during conversion, leading to incorrect color values.

### Potential Error Location:
- The issue is likely arising from the conditional block that handles RGBA format images.
  
### Cause of the Bug:
- The bug is caused by the loss of transparency information when converting RGBA PNG images to RGB format.
  
### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
- Modify the conversion process for RGBA images to RGB such that transparency is preserved during the conversion.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
    # Storing the original image mode for reference
    original_mode = image.mode

    if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA':
        # Create a new RGBA image with white background
        background = Image.new('RGBA', image.size, (255, 255, 255, 255))
        background.paste(image, (0, 0), image)

        # Convert RGBA to RGB while preserving transparency
        image = background.convert('RGB')
        image.putalpha(background.split()[3])

    elif image.mode != 'RGB':
        # Convert other image modes to RGB
        image = image.convert('RGB')

    if size:
        # Create a copy of the image and resize it to the specified size
        image = image.copy()
        image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)

    buf = BytesIO()
    image.save(buf, 'JPEG')
    return image, buf
```

### Explanation:
- In the corrected version, transparency information is preserved when converting RGBA images to RGB.
- By storing the original mode of the image and using `putalpha` method after conversion, the transparency is retained.
- This fix ensures that the converted images maintain their color integrity and transparency when processed in the pipeline.
