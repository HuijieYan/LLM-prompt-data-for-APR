### Analysis
The `convert_image` function in the `ImagesPipeline` class is responsible for converting images to the specified format. The error message indicates that there is a mismatch in the expected and actual colors of the converted image when dealing with transparency cases.

### Potential Error Location
The potential error lies in the section of the code that handles the conversion of images with transparency (PNG with RGBA mode). The issue could be related to the way the conversion is implemented for such images.

### Cause of the Bug
The bug occurs because the code is not properly handling transparency in images with the PNG format and RGBA mode. The conversion logic for these images should take into account the transparency channel as well.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug
To fix the bug, we need to modify the conversion logic for images with 'PNG' format and 'RGBA' mode to ensure that transparency is properly handled. This may involve creating a new image with a white background before pasting the original image to ensure correct conversion.

### Corrected Version
Here is the corrected version of the `convert_image` function in the `ImagesPipeline` class:

```python
def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
    if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA':
        background = Image.new('RGBA', image.size, (255, 255, 255, 255))
        background.paste(image, (0, 0), image)
        image = background.convert('RGB')
    elif image.mode != 'RGB':
        image = image.convert('RGB')

    if size:
        image = image.copy()
        image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)

    buf = BytesIO()
    image.save(buf, 'JPEG')
    return image, buf
```

This corrected version ensures that images with PNG format and RGBA mode are properly converted, taking into consideration the transparency channel. It creates a new image with a white background and properly pastes the original image to maintain transparency during the conversion process.
