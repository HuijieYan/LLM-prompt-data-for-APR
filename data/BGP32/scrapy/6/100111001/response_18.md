### Potential Error Locations
1. In the first if statement where the condition checks for `image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA'`, the background is created using the size of the input image, which might not have a corresponding alpha channel if the image is in RGB mode.
2. In the `background.paste(image, image)` line, the paste method is being called with the same image as both the source and the destination, which might lead to unexpected results.
3. The `image.save(buf, 'JPEG')` line saves the image as a JPEG format regardless of the initial format of the input image.

### Cause of the Bug
The bug stems from the incorrect handling of images with different modes and formats in the `convert_image` function. When the input image is in the PNG format with an RGBA mode, the function attempts to convert it to an RGB image by creating a white background image. However, the paste operation and the subsequent conversion to RGB lead to an incorrect output, causing the test case to fail.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug
1. Check the image mode and format separately to handle different cases appropriately.
2. Avoid pasting the image onto itself.
3. Save the image in the same format as the input image to maintain consistency.

### Corrected Version of the Function
```python
def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
    if image.format.upper() == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA':
        background = Image.new('RGBA', image.size, (255, 255, 255, 255))
        background.paste(image, (0, 0), image)
        image = background.convert('RGB')
    elif image.mode != 'RGB':
        image = image.convert('RGB')

    if size:
        image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)

    buf = BytesIO()
    image.save(buf, image.format)
    return image, buf
```

In the corrected version:
1. We check the image format case-insensitively to handle different variations.
2. When creating the background for PNG images with an RGBA mode, we provide an alpha channel by setting the RGBA tuple.
3. We correctly paste the image onto the background at the origin.
4. The image is saved in the same format as the input image to maintain consistency.
