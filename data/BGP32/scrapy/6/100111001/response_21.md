### Analysis:
- The `convert_image` function is supposed to handle image conversions based on format and mode. It has conditional blocks that check for PNG format and RGBA mode and convert them to RGB mode. Additionally, it resizes images if a size parameter is provided before saving them as JPEG.
- The failing test is related to a case where the function doesn't correctly convert an image with transparency from RGBA to RGB mode, leading to an assertion error.
- The issue seems to be with how transparency in RGBA images is handled and converted to RGB.

### Bug Cause:
The bug originates from how the function handles images with transparent pixels in RGBA mode when converting them to RGB. The `getcolors()` method is used in the failing test to check colors in the image, and it fails because the alpha channel transparency values are not being accounted for in the conversion process.

### Bug Fix:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that transparent pixels are handled correctly during the conversion from RGBA to RGB. The approach will involve creating a white background image and pasting the RGBA image onto it before converting to RGB.

### Corrected Function:
```python
def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
    if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA':
        background = Image.new('RGBA', image.size, (255, 255, 255, 255))
        background.paste(image, (0, 0), image)
        image = background.convert('RGB')
    elif image.mode != 'RGB':
        image = image.convert('RGB')

    if size:
        image = image.copy()
        image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)

    buf = BytesIO()
    image.save(buf, 'JPEG')
    return image, buf
```

By creating a white background image with RGBA mode and ensuring the paste operation retains transparency, we correctly handle the conversion from RGBA to RGB for images with transparency. This corrected function should now pass the failing test.
