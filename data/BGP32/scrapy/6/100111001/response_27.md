### Analysis
The buggy function `convert_image` is intended to handle image processing and conversion, but there are multiple issues that need to be addressed:
1. When converting an RGBA PNG image to RGB mode, the function uses a white background but incorrectly passes `image` twice to the `paste` method. This is incorrect and causes issues with transparency.
2. The function does not handle cases where the input image has a palette mode (`P`) properly, leading to incorrect conversion results.

### Bug Cause
The bug arises due to incorrect handling of image conversion in the `convert_image` function, specifically when dealing with RGBA images and images in palette mode.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug
1. Fix the code segment responsible for converting RGBA images to RGB mode. Ensure proper handling of alpha channels and transparency.
2. Update the logic to handle image conversion for images in palette mode correctly.

### Corrected Version
```python
def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
    if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA':
        background = Image.new('RGB', image.size, (255, 255, 255))
        background.paste(image, (0, 0), image)
        image = background
    elif image.mode != 'RGB' and image.mode != 'P':
        image = image.convert('RGB')

    if size:
        image = image.copy()
        image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)

    buf = BytesIO()
    image.save(buf, 'JPEG')
    return image, buf
```

By making these corrections, the function should now handle RGBA images correctly by using the proper background handling and resolve conversion issues related to palette mode images. Running the failing test should now pass without any assertion errors.
