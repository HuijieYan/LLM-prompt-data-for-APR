The bug in the `convert_image` function is caused by the incorrect handling of transparency in PNG images. The function mistakenly converts any RGBA image to RGB by simply discarding the alpha channel, resulting in a loss of transparency information.

To fix this bug, we need to preserve the transparency information when converting RGBA PNG images. One way to achieve this is by creating a new RGBA image with a white background and then compositing the original RGBA image on top of it, thus maintaining the transparency.

Here is the corrected version of the `convert_image` function:

```python
def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
    if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA':
        background = Image.new('RGBA', image.size, (255, 255, 255, 255))
        background.paste(image, (0, 0), image)
        image = background.convert('RGB')
    elif image.mode != 'RGB':
        image = image.convert('RGB')

    if size:
        image = image.copy()
        image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)

    buf = BytesIO()
    image.save(buf, 'JPEG')
    return image, buf
```

With this correction, the function will correctly handle RGBA PNG images by preserving transparency during the conversion process. This fix should make the failing test cases pass and ensure that transparency information is maintained in the converted images.
