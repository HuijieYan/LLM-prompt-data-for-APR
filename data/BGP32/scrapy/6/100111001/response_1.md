### Analysis
The buggy function `convert_image` is supposed to convert images to the RGB mode and possibly resize them before saving them in JPEG format. The bug seems to be in the first if condition where the code is supposed to handle PNG images with RGBA mode. The issue might be related to how the background image is pasted onto the new image, causing unexpected behavior.

### Bug Explanation
When processing PNG images with RGBA mode in the buggy function, the code is creating a new background image and pasting the original image onto it, but instead of using the `image` parameter to paste, it is being passed twice. This incorrect usage likely leads to unexpected behavior, resulting in incorrect conversion and failing the test cases.

### Bug Fix
To fix the bug, we need to correct how the original image is pasted onto the background image. We should resolve this issue by fixing the way the `paste` method is called, ensuring only the original image is pasted onto the background.

### Corrected Version
```python
from PIL import Image
from cStringIO import StringIO as BytesIO

def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
    if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA':
        background = Image.new('RGBA', image.size, (255, 255, 255))
        background.paste(image, (0, 0), image)
        image = background.convert('RGB')
    elif image.mode != 'RGB':
        image = image.convert('RGB')

    if size:
        image = image.copy()
        image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)

    buf = BytesIO()
    image.save(buf, 'JPEG')
    return image, buf
```

By correcting the way the images are pasted in the RGBA mode condition, the function should now correctly handle PNG images with RGBA mode and pass the failing test cases.
