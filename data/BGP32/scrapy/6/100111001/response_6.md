### Explanation:
The bug in the `convert_image` function lies in the conditional block that checks if the image format is PNG and the mode is RGBA. In that block, the function mistakenly overwrites the image content, which leads to incorrect results, especially when dealing with RGBA images.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. The function should avoid modifying the original image data directly in the conditional block. Instead, it should create a new image to preserve the original data.
2. All conversions and modifications should be performed on the new image object to prevent unintended changes to the original image.
3. Ensure that the desired output format and mode are correctly set for the final image.

### The corrected version of the function:
```python
def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
    if image.format == "PNG" and image.mode == "RGBA":
        background = Image.new("RGBA", image.size, (255, 255, 255, 255))
        background.paste(image, (0, 0), image)
        image = background.convert("RGB")
    else:
        image = image.convert("RGB")

    if size:
        image = image.copy()
        image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)

    buf = BytesIO()
    image.save(buf, "JPEG")
    return image, buf
```

By correcting the function as shown above, the issue with directly modifying the image content in the RGBA conversion block is resolved. This corrected version should pass the failing test cases provided.
