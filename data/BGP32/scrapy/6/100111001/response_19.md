### Potential Error Locations:
1. The condition for handling PNG images with RGBA mode is incorrect as it only checks for the format to be PNG and the mode to be RGBA but does not consider the transparency channel.
2. In the case where the image mode is not RGB, the conversion is not being performed correctly.
3. There might be an issue in saving the image as JPEG format.

### Bug Explanation:
1. In Case 3, when the function attempts to convert the PNG image with RGBA mode, it creates a new background image with a white background but misses transferring the transparency values. This leads to the output image losing its transparency.
2. In Case 2, the thumbnail size calculated is incorrect, resulting in unexpected dimensions for the image.
3. The function fails to consider the transparency channel while processing PNG images with an alpha channel, resulting in unexpected output colors.

### Fix Strategy:
1. Modify the condition for PNG images with RGBA mode to preserve transparency.
2. Ensure correct conversion of images to RGB format when the mode is not RGB.
3. Troubleshoot the image saving process to ensure the correct format is maintained.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
    if image.format == 'PNG':  # Update the condition to handle PNG images with transparency
        if image.mode == 'RGBA':
            background = Image.new('RGBA', image.size, (255, 255, 255, 255))
            background.paste(image, (0, 0), image)
            image = background.convert('RGB')
        else:
            image = image.convert('RGB')
    elif image.mode != 'RGB':
        image = image.convert('RGB')

    if size:
        image = image.copy()
        image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)

    buf = BytesIO()
    image.save(buf, 'JPEG', quality=95)  # Ensure the correct format and quality while saving
    return image, buf
```

With this correction, the function should now handle PNG images with transparency correctly, convert images to the RGB format when needed, and save images as JPEG with suitable quality. This updated version should pass the failing test cases.
