### Bug Explanation
The bug lies in the condition checking for `PNG` format images with `RGBA` mode in the `convert_image` function. When the input image is of format `PNG` and mode `RGBA`, the function creates a new image named `background` with a white background, pastes the original image onto it, and then converts it to `RGB`. However, the `paste` method is used incorrectly with the same image object as both source and destination, which results in a distorted image during the pasting operation. This incorrect pasting leads to an incorrect conversion and failure in the test cases.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix this bug, the function should paste the image to a new blank `RGBA` image (not filled with white) and then convert it to `RGB` to preserve image integrity. Additionally, the condition for converting images with mode `RGBA` to `RGB` should also be revised to achieve the correct behavior.

### Corrected Code
```python
# The corrected convert_image function
def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
    if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA':
        background = Image.new('RGBA', image.size)
        background.paste(image, (0, 0, image.size[0], image.size[1]))
        image = background.convert('RGB')
    elif image.mode != 'RGB':
        image = image.convert('RGB')

    if size:
        image = image.copy()
        image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)

    buf = BytesIO()
    image.save(buf, 'JPEG')
    return image, buf
```

After applying the above fix, the `convert_image` function should now correctly handle PNG images with RGBA mode and avoid the pasting distortion issue, leading to passing test cases.
