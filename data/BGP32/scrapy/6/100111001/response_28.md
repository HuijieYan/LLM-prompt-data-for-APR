### Bug Explanation
The bug in the `convert_image` function lies in the conditional block that handles images of format PNG with mode RGBA. In this block, the function creates a new image `background` with mode RGBA and then tries to paste the original image onto it using the `paste` function. However, the correct usage of the `paste` function is to specify the `box` parameter to determine the position to paste the image, but in this case, the `image` argument is being used for both the image and the box, which results in an incorrect operation.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix this bug, we need to modify the way the original image is pasted onto the background image. Specifically, we should specify the correct `box` parameter to ensure that the images are correctly blended. Additionally, we need to ensure that the image is converted to RGB after the paste operation.

### Corrected Version
```python
def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
    if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA':
        background = Image.new('RGB', image.size, (255, 255, 255))
        background.paste(image, (0, 0), image)
        image = background
    elif image.mode != 'RGB':
        image = image.convert('RGB')

    if size:
        image = image.copy()
        image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)

    buf = BytesIO()
    image.save(buf, 'JPEG')
    return image, buf
``` 

By making these changes, the function should now correctly handle images of PNG format with RGBA mode and pass the failing test case.
