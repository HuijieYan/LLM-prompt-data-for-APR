### Analysis
The buggy function is supposed to convert images to RGB mode and JPEG format if necessary. There are some issues in the function:
1. In the first condition where PNG images with RGBA mode should be converted to RGB mode, the `paste` method is called incorrectly, which results in an error.
2. In the case where the input image mode is not RGB, the conversion is incorrectly performed.
3. The function saves the image as 'JPEG' without considering the original image format, which could lead to inconsistency.

### Bug Cause
- The primary cause of the bug is the incorrect usage of the `paste` method inside the first condition where PNG images with RGBA mode should be converted to RGB mode. Using `background.paste(image, image)` causes the program to consider the image itself as the paste mask. This leads to an incorrect conversion and image representation.

### Fix Strategy
- Amend the usage of the `paste` method by passing the correct argument to avoid the bug.
- Ensure that the image conversion is consistent and that the output format matches the input format intelligently.

### Corrected Function
```python
def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
    if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA':
        background = Image.new('RGB', image.size, (255, 255, 255))
        background.paste(image, (0, 0), image)
        image = background
    elif image.mode != 'RGB':
        image = image.convert('RGB')

    if size:
        image = image.copy()
        image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)

    buf = BytesIO()
    if image.format:
        image.save(buf, image.format)
    else:
        image.save(buf, 'JPEG')
    
    return image, buf
```

By correcting the usage of the `paste` method and ensuring that the image format is retained during saving, the function should now pass the failing test.
