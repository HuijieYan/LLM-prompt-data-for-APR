### Bug Explanation
The bug in the `convert_image` function arises from the incorrect handling of images with transparency. When the input image is in PNG format with RGBA mode, the function is supposed to convert it to RGB mode while preserving the image's appearance. However, due to a mistake in the implementation, the conversion is not accurate, leading to different colors in the output image compared to the input image.

In the failing test case, the test expects the converted image to match the original image after the PNG to RGB conversion. Still, due to the incorrect handling of transparency, the colors differ, resulting in the test failure.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that when converting images with transparency (PNG format, RGBA mode) to RGB mode, we preserve the original appearance of the image. The fix involves correctly handling the transparency channel during the conversion process to avoid altering the colors of the image.

### Corrected Function
Here is the corrected version of the `convert_image` function:

```python
def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
    if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA':
        background = Image.new('RGB', image.size, (255, 255, 255))
        background.paste(image, image)
        image = background
    elif image.mode != 'RGB':
        image = image.convert('RGB')

    if size:
        image = image.copy()
        image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)

    buf = BytesIO()
    image.save(buf, 'JPEG')
    return image, buf
```

With this corrected version, the function should accurately convert images with transparency from PNG RGBA mode to RGB mode without altering the colors, thus passing the failing test cases.
