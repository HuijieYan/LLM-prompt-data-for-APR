### Bug Explanation
The bug in the `convert_image` function occurs when handling images with format 'PNG' and mode 'RGBA'. If the input image has these characteristics, a new image is created with a white background, then the original image is pasted onto this new image, and then the final image is converted to 'RGB' mode. The issue arises because when pasting the original image onto the background, the method `paste` should receive a position as a tuple `(0, 0)` to start pasting from the top left corner, but instead, the original image object is supplied twice to the `paste` method, resulting in unexpected image manipulation and wrong output.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, ensure that the original image is correctly pasted onto the background by providing the position `(0, 0)` in the `paste` method when working with 'PNG' images in 'RGBA' mode.

### Corrected Version of the Function
```python
def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
    if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA':
        background = Image.new('RGBA', image.size, (255, 255, 255))
        background.paste(image, (0, 0)) # Ensure correct position when pasting the image on the background
        image = background.convert('RGB')
    elif image.mode != 'RGB':
        image = image.convert('RGB')

    if size:
        image = image.copy()
        image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)

    buf = BytesIO()
    image.save(buf, 'JPEG')
    return image, buf
```

By making this adjustment in the `convert_image` function, the bug should be fixed, and the failing test should now pass without any issues.
