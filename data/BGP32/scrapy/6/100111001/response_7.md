### Potential Error Location
The potential error in the `convert_image` function lies in the conditional block that handles PNG images with RGBA mode. The background image is created with RGBA mode but later converted to RGB mode without accounting for the transparency information. This causes the bug in the failing test as the transparency information is lost during the conversion.

### Cause of the Bug
The bug occurs because when the background image is created with RGB mode, the transparency information from the original RGBA image is discarded. As a result, the colors in the converted image are incorrect, leading to test failures.

### Fixing the Bug
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that transparency information is retained when converting RGBA images to RGB mode. One way to achieve this is by using the `convert_alpha()` method in PIL to handle RGBA images properly.

### Corrected Version of the Function
```python
def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
    if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA':
        # Create a new RGBA image with white background
        background = Image.new('RGBA', image.size, (255, 255, 255))
        background.paste(image, (0, 0), image)
        # Convert RGBA image to RGB, retaining transparency
        image = background.convert('RGB')
    elif image.mode != 'RGB':
        image = image.convert('RGB')

    if size:
        image = image.copy()
        image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)

    buf = BytesIO()
    image.save(buf, 'JPEG')
    return image, buf
```

By using the `paste` method with the third argument specifying the mask image, we can retain the transparency information when pasting the RGBA image onto the white background. This corrected version of the `convert_image` function should now properly handle RGBA images and pass the failing test cases.
