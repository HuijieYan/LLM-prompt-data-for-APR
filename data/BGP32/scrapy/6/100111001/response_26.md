### Potential Error Locations:
1. The conditional check for PNG format and RGBA mode may not be handling the transparency properly.
2. The conversion to RGB mode may not be correctly handling the transparency component in RGBA mode images.
3. The `background.paste` function may not be pasting the image correctly.

### Error Cause:
The bug arises from how the function handles PNG images with an RGBA mode. The function converts the image to RGB by creating a white background, pasting the original image on it, and then converting to RGB. However, the transparency component in the RGBA mode is not properly handled, leading to incorrect color values and causing the test to fail.

### Fix Strategy:
An approach to fix the bug is to split the process for handling RGBA images more effectively by considering transparency. This involves correctly pasting the RGBA image onto a white background and then converting it to RGB. Additionally, ensuring that transparency in the RGBA mode is handled accurately during the conversion process will help resolve the issue.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
    if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA':
        background = Image.new('RGBA', image.size, (255, 255, 255, 255))  # Include alpha channel in white background
        background.paste(image, (0, 0), image)  # Paste the original image considering transparency
        image = background.convert('RGB')  # Convert to RGB mode
    elif image.mode != 'RGB':
        image = image.convert('RGB')

    if size:
        image = image.copy()
        image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)

    buf = BytesIO()
    image.save(buf, 'JPEG')
    return image, buf
```

By incorporating these changes, the corrected function will accurately handle PNG images with an RGBA mode, ensuring that transparency is preserved while converting them to RGB.
