### Analysis
- The buggy function `convert_image` is intended to take an image and an optional size parameter, convert the image to RGB format, resize it if needed, and save it as a JPEG image in a buffer.
- In the failing test, the conversion and resizing are not working as expected for RGBA and PNG images.
- The function has conditional blocks to handle PNG RGBA images and mode conversion, but there might be issues with the logic inside these blocks.

### Bug Explanation
- When dealing with PNG RGBA images, the function correctly creates a new RGBA image with a white background, pastes the original image onto it, and converts it to RGB. However, during the paste operation, it uses the same image object as the background, which results in an incorrect conversion.
- The bug becomes evident when the converted image is compared with the expected value in the failing test for transparent images.

### Fix Strategy
- To fix the bug, it is necessary to create a separate background image when dealing with PNG RGBA images. This ensures that the paste operation does not affect the original image.
- Additionally, the conditional check for PNG RGBA images can be simplified to ensure correct processing.
- The RGB mode conversion logic can also be improved to handle cases with a palette.

### Corrected Version
```python
def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
    if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA':
        background = Image.new('RGBA', image.size, (255, 255, 255))
        background.paste(image, (0, 0), image)
        image = background.convert('RGB')
    elif image.mode != 'RGB' and image.mode != 'P':
        image = image.convert('RGB')

    if size:
        image = image.copy()
        image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)

    buf = BytesIO()
    image.save(buf, 'JPEG')
    return image, buf
```

By incorporating the suggested changes, this corrected version of the function should now pass the failing test cases provided.
