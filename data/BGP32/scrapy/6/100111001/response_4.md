### Explanation:
The bug in the `convert_image` function arises from the condition that checks if the input image is in PNG format and RGBA mode. In this case, the function creates a new background image, pastes the original image onto it, and then converts the background image to RGB. However, when pasting the image onto the background, the correct approach is to paste the alpha channel (transparency) as well since the original image has an alpha channel that the background needs to take into account.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to modify the section of code where the background is created and the original image is pasted onto it for PNG images with RGBA mode. Instead of just pasting the RGB channels, we need to paste all channels including the alpha channel to preserve transparency.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
    if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA':
        background = Image.new('RGBA', image.size, (255, 255, 255, 255))  # Include alpha channel
        background.paste(image, (0, 0), image)
        image = background.convert('RGB')
    elif image.mode != 'RGB':
        image = image.convert('RGB')

    if size:
        image = image.copy()
        image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)

    buf = BytesIO()
    image.save(buf, 'JPEG')
    return image, buf
```

By correcting the pasting operation for PNG images with RGBA mode, the function should now correctly preserve transparency and handle the conversion of images to the desired format and size.
