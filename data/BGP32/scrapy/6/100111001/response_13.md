### Potential Error Locations:
1. The condition `if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA'` might not be functioning correctly, as the conversion logic inside this block might be incorrect.
2. The handling of transparency in the case of PNG images with RGBA mode could be causing issues during conversion.

### Bug Explanation:
The failing test is expecting a converted image with certain color values, but the buggy function is returning different color values after conversion. This discrepancy is likely due to incorrect handling of PNG images with RGBA mode during conversion in the function.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Ensure the condition for checking PNG images with RGBA mode is executed correctly.
2. Verify the transparency handling in the conversion process to ensure correct color output.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
    if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA':
        background = Image.new('RGBA', image.size, (255, 255, 255))
        background.paste(image, (0, 0), image)
        image = background.convert('RGB')
    elif image.mode != 'RGB':
        image = image.convert('RGB')

    if size:
        image = image.copy()
        image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)

    buf = BytesIO()
    image.save(buf, 'JPEG')
    return image, buf
```

With the correction made to ensure proper handling of RGBA mode and transparency in PNG images, the function should now produce the expected output for the failing test cases.
