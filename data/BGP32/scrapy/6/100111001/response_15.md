### Identified Bug
The bug lies in the image conversion process inside the `convert_image` function. When the input image format is `'PNG'` and mode is `'RGBA'`, the function creates a new `Image` object named `background` using a white color background and pastes the input image onto it. However, the `paste` function expects a coordinate tuple as the second argument, but is provided with the `image` object itself, resulting in an error and incorrect conversion.

### Bug Cause
The bug occurs because the `paste` function requires a coordinate tuple as the second argument, but the function incorrectly passes the `image` object. This leads to incorrect image conversion and failure in the test case where the input image format is `'PNG'` and mode is `'RGBA'`.

### Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, the function should correctly pass the coordinate tuple to the `paste` function when creating the `background` image with a white background and pasting the input image onto it.

### Corrected Version
```python
def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
    if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA':
        background = Image.new('RGBA', image.size, (255, 255, 255))
        background.paste(image, (0, 0))
        image = background.convert('RGB')
    elif image.mode != 'RGB':
        image = image.convert('RGB')

    if size:
        image = image.copy()
        image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)

    buf = BytesIO()
    image.save(buf, 'JPEG')
    return image, buf
``` 

With this correction, the bug related to incorrect image conversion in the `convert_image` function should be fixed and the failing test cases should pass successfully.
