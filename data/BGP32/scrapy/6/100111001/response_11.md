### Explanation:
The issue is with the function failing to handle images with transparency properly. In the buggy function, there is a conditional check for images in PNG format and with RGBA mode to convert RGB images. However, when images with RGBA mode are encountered, the alpha channel is not properly considered, leading to incorrect conversion.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Modify the conditional check for PNG images with RGBA mode to handle transparency correctly by considering the alpha channel information.
2. Ensure that the alpha channel information is correctly handled during the conversion process.

### Corrected Version of the Function:

```python
def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
    if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA':
        background = Image.new('RGBA', image.size, (255, 255, 255, 255))
        background.paste(image, (0, 0), image)
        image = background.convert('RGB', palette=Image.ADAPTIVE, colors=256)
    elif image.mode != 'RGB':
        image = image.convert('RGB')

    if size:
        image = image.copy()
        image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)

    buf = BytesIO()
    image.save(buf, 'JPEG')
    return image, buf
```

With this corrected version of the function, the images with transparency should now be handled properly during conversion, ensuring that the alpha channel information is not lost. This should address the failing test cases.
