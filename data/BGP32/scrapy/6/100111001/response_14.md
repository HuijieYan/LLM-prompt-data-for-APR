### Potential Error Locations:
1. The condition to convert images with format 'PNG' and mode 'RGBA' to 'RGB' might be incorrect.
2. The conversion of other image modes may not be handled correctly, leading to unexpected results.
3. Handling of thumbnail size and conversion might be causing issues.
4. Saving the image as JPEG could lead to a loss of information or color changes.

### Cause of the Bug:
The bug occurs because the function does not handle the conversion of images with 'PNG' format and 'RGBA' mode to 'RGB' mode correctly. This leads to unexpected changes in image colors during the conversion process. Additionally, the function does not properly handle thumbnail resizing, resulting in incorrect image sizes. 

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
1. Correctly handle the conversion of images with 'PNG' format and 'RGBA' mode to 'RGB' mode.
2. Ensure that the conversion of image modes other than 'RGB' is handled properly.
3. Properly manage thumbnail resizing to maintain the aspect ratio of images.
4. Save the image in JPEG format without losing any crucial information or altering colors.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
    if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA':
        background = Image.new('RGB', image.size, (255, 255, 255))
        background.paste(image, (0, 0), image)
        image = background
    elif image.mode != 'RGB':
        image = image.convert('RGB')

    if size:
        image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)

    buf = BytesIO()
    image.save(buf, 'PNG')  # Save the image as PNG to avoid color changes
    return image, buf
```

By correcting the handling of the image conversion for 'PNG' format and 'RGBA' mode and saving the image as PNG instead of JPEG, the function should now pass the failing test cases.
