### Analysis
The buggy function `convert_image` is intended to convert images to the RGB mode and save them as JPEG format. However, there are several issues causing the function to not work as expected:
1. The condition to check if the image format is 'PNG' and mode is 'RGBA' does not seem relevant to the task of converting images to RGB and saving as JPEG.
2. When converting the image to RGB, the function should create a new image object with the RGB mode, but it is trying to overwrite the original image object.
3. Saving the image as JPEG directly may not work in all cases as the input image might be in different modes or formats.

### Fixing Strategy
1. Remove the unnecessary condition related to 'PNG' and 'RGBA' modes.
2. Make sure to create a new RGB image object when converting instead of overwriting the original image.
3. Use BytesIO to save the image correctly in the JPEG format.

### Code Fix
```python
def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
    # Convert the image to RGB mode
    image = image.convert('RGB')

    # Resize the image if a size is provided
    if size:
        image = image.copy()
        image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)

    # Save the image as JPEG
    buf = BytesIO()
    image.save(buf, 'JPEG')
    
    # Seek to the beginning of the buffer before returning
    buf.seek(0)
    
    return image, buf
``` 

By implementing the above fixes, the function should correctly convert images to RGB mode, resize if required, and save them as JPEG format, resolving the issues identified in the buggy function.
