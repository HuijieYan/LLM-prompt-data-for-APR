### Analysis
The buggy function `convert_image` is meant to receive an image and optionally a size parameter, then perform some operations on the image like conversion and resizing before returning the modified image and its binary representation. However, there are a couple of issues identified in the function based on the runtime values and expected values provided.

1. The image is not correctly handled in the condition where the format is 'PNG' and mode is 'RGBA'. It attempts to convert the image to an RGB mode but uses the wrong paste operation, which results in a potential loss of alpha channel information.
   
2. In the first conditional block, there is an issue with the `paste` operation where it should be `background.paste(image, (0, 0), image)` instead of passing `image` twice. 

3. The conversion from mode 'P' to 'RGB' seems to be handled incorrectly and should be addressed to maintain the original image's mode.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the issues in the buggy function `convert_image`:
1. Rewrite the condition where the image format is 'PNG' and mode is 'RGBA' to correctly handle the conversion without losing alpha channel information.
2. Fix the `paste` operation by providing the correct arguments for the destination position and the source image.
3. Address the conversion from mode 'P' to 'RGB' to maintain the original image's mode integrity.

### The corrected version of the function
```python
def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
    if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA':
        background = Image.new('RGBA', image.size, (255, 255, 255))
        background.paste(image, (0, 0), image)
        image = background.convert('RGB')
    elif image.mode != 'RGB':
        image = image.convert('RGB')
    
    if size:
        image = image.copy()
        image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)
    
    buf = BytesIO()
    image.save(buf, 'JPEG')
    return image, buf
``` 

By correcting the issues in the function as outlined, it should now properly handle images of different formats and modes while maintaining correct conversion and resizing operations.
