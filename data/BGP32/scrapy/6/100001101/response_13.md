The buggy function has several issues that need to be addressed to fix the bug:

1. In the first conditional branch, when the image format is PNG and mode is RGBA, the background image is created incorrectly using `Image.new()` and then pasted incorrectly using `background.paste()`.
2. The `image.save()` function saves the image in JPEG format without specifying an output format.

To fix the bug, we need to correct the image creation and pasting logic and pass the correct format when saving the image.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
    if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA':
        background = Image.new('RGB', image.size, (255, 255, 255))
        background.paste(image, (0, 0), image)
        image = background
    elif image.mode != 'RGB':
        image = image.convert('RGB')

    if size:
        image = image.copy()
        image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)

    buf = BytesIO()
    image.save(buf, 'PNG')
    return image, buf

```

In the corrected function:
1. If the image format is PNG and mode is RGBA, a new RGB image is created as the background and the RGBA image is pasted onto it correctly.
2. When saving the image, the format is specified as PNG.

This corrected version should now satisfy all the expected input/output values provided in the test cases.
