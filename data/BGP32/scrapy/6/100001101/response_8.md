### Analysis
The buggy function has multiple issues:
1. The condition checking for PNG format and RGBA mode is incorrect as it should convert PNG images with RGBA mode to RGB mode, not the other way around.
2. In the same conditional block, the image is pasted onto a white background, but the `paste()` method shouldn't be used in this context.
3. There is no handling for converting images with mode other than RGB to RGB directly without additional processing.

### Bug Cause
The bug is caused by incorrect conversion logic for PNG images with RGBA mode and lack of direct conversion for images with non-RGB mode.

### Fix Strategy
1. Correct the condition for PNG images with RGBA mode to convert them to RGB mode using direct conversion.
2. Add a direct conversion step for images with mode other than RGB.

### Corrected Version
```python
def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
    if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA':
        image = image.convert('RGB')
    elif image.mode != 'RGB':
        image = image.convert('RGB')

    if size:
        image = image.copy()
        image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)

    buf = BytesIO()
    image.save(buf, 'JPEG')
    return image, buf
``` 

With these changes, the function will now correctly handle different image modes and formats to ensure a consistent output in RGB mode and JPEG format.
