The bug in the provided function is that in the `convert_image` function, there is a conditional check for PNG images with RGBA mode, but the condition is incorrectly checking for `image.format == 'PNG'` instead of `image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA'`. This leads to incorrect conversion for images that are not PNG with RGB mode.

To fix the bug, we need to correct the conditional check for PNG images with RGBA mode. Additionally, ensure that the image format and mode are checked appropriately for conversion.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
# The corrected version of the function
def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
    if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA':
        background = Image.new('RGBA', image.size, (255, 255, 255))
        background.paste(image, (0, 0), image)
        image = background.convert('RGB')
    elif image.mode != 'RGB':
        image = image.convert('RGB')

    if size:
        image = image.copy()
        image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)

    buf = BytesIO()
    image.save(buf, 'JPEG')
    return image, buf
```

This corrected function fixes the conditional check for PNG images with RGBA mode and addresses the conversion logic for different image formats and modes. The function should now operate correctly based on the expected input/output values provided.
