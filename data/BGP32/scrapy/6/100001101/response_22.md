### Buggy Function Explanation:
1. The function `convert_image` is designed to receive an input image and optionally resize it. It has a conditional check that switches the mode of the image to RGB if it's not already in RGB mode. It also handles the case when the format is PNG and the mode is RGBA by converting it to RGB.
2. The bug occurs when converting from PNG with RGBA mode to RGB mode. The conversion is not done correctly, as it is replacing the original image instead of creating a new image with the converted mode.
3. The function incorrectly alters the original image instead of creating a new one, leading to unexpected behavior and incorrect results.
4. To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the original image is not altered and the converted image is saved correctly.

### Fix Strategy:
1. Ensure that when converting from PNG with RGBA mode to RGB mode, a new image is created with the converted mode instead of altering the original image.
2. Save the converted image correctly to the buffer before returning it.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
    original_format = image.format

    if original_format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA':
        background = Image.new('RGBA', image.size, (255, 255, 255))
        background.paste(image, (0, 0), image)
        image = background.convert('RGB')
    elif image.mode != 'RGB':
        image = image.convert('RGB')

    if size:
        image_copy = image.copy()
        image_copy.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)
    else:
        image_copy = image

    buf = BytesIO()
    image_copy.save(buf, 'JPEG')
    return image_copy, buf
``` 

This corrected version ensures that the original image is not altered during the conversion process. It creates a new image copy and performs any required modifications on the copy, thus preserving the integrity of the original image. Additionally, it correctly saves the converted image to the buffer before returning it.
