The buggy function has multiple issues that need to be addressed:

1. In the first if condition where the format is 'PNG' and mode is 'RGBA', the paste operation should be corrected as `background.paste(image, (0, 0))` instead of `background.paste(image, image)`.

2. The else condition that converts images to 'RGB' is not ideal because it might cause image quality loss during conversion unnecessarily.

To address these issues, we can modify the function as follows:

```python
def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
    if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA':
        background = Image.new('RGBA', image.size, (255, 255, 255))
        background.paste(image, (0, 0))
        image = background.convert('RGB')

    if size:
        image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)

    buf = BytesIO()
    image.save(buf, 'JPEG')
    return image, buf
```

This corrected version ensures that the paste operation is done correctly and removes unnecessary conversion of images to 'RGB' mode.
