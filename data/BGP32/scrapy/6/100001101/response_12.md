### Identified Bug:
The bug in the `convert_image` function lies in the conditions for checking the image format and mode. The function incorrectly handles the conversion of images with formats other than PNG and modes other than RGBA or RGB, which leads to incorrect image conversions.

### Bug Explanation:
1. In Case 1 and Case 2, the function fails to properly convert the image format and mode, leading to an incorrect image conversion. It results in a loss of the image's original format and mode.
2. In Case 3, when the image format is PNG and the mode is RGBA, the function incorrectly pastes the image onto a white background and converts it to RGB, leading to a potential loss of image quality.
3. In Case 4, when the image mode is not RGB but P, the function erroneously converts it to RGB without considering the original mode.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to revise the conditional statements to correctly handle image conversions based on their format and mode. The function should retain the original format and mode of the image while applying necessary conversions.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
    if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA':
        background = Image.new('RGBA', image.size, (255, 255, 255))
        background.paste(image, (0, 0), image)
        image = background.convert('RGBA')
    elif image.mode != 'RGB':
        image = image.convert('RGB')

    if size:
        image = image.copy()
        image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)

    buf = BytesIO()
    image.save(buf, 'JPEG')
    return image, buf
```

By making these changes, the `convert_image` function should now correctly handle image format and mode conversions based on the input parameters and satisfy the expected values outlined in the test cases.
