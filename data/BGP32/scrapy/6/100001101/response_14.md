### Analysis
The buggy function `convert_image()` is designed to convert images to a specific format and apply resizing if needed. There are several potential error locations within the function:
1. In the first `if` statement, when checking if the image format is 'PNG' and the mode is 'RGBA', a new image with a white background is created, but the `paste()` method is used incorrectly.
2. The `image.save()` method at the end of the function saves the image in the 'JPEG' format, but it should save based on the image format.

### Bug Cause
The bug occurs due to incorrect usage of the `paste()` method inside the first `if` statement. The `paste()` method expects a second argument as the box parameter, not the image itself. This leads to an incorrect conversion when the image format is 'PNG' and the mode is 'RGBA'.

### Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to correct the usage of the `paste()` method by passing the image as the second argument correctly. Additionally, we should modify the `image.save()` method to save the image in the correct format based on the input image format.

### Corrected Version
```python
def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
    if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA':
        background = Image.new('RGBA', image.size, (255, 255, 255))
        background.paste(image, (0, 0), image)
        image = background.convert('RGB')
    elif image.mode != 'RGB':
        image = image.convert('RGB')

    if size:
        image = image.copy()
        image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)

    buf = BytesIO()
    image.save(buf, image.format)
    return image, buf
``` 

By passing the correct arguments to the `paste()` method and using the image format instead of hardcoding 'JPEG' in the `image.save()` method, the corrected function should now handle the image conversion and resizing correctly based on the input and expected values.
