### Analysis
1. The `convert_image` function is designed to process images, convert them to RGB mode, create thumbnails, and save them in JPEG format.
2. The potential error locations are around the conditional blocks checking the image format and mode.
3. The error occurs when converting an RGBA image to RGB mode. The function incorrectly handles the transparency channel during conversion, leading to the incorrect color values. This causes the test case to fail.
4. To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the transparency channel is properly handled when converting RGBA images to RGB mode.
5. Below is the corrected version of the `convert_image` function:

### The corrected version of the function
```python
class ImagesPipeline(FilesPipeline):
    def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
        if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA':
            background = Image.new('RGB', image.size, (255, 255, 255))
            background.paste(image, (0, 0), image)
            image = background
        elif image.mode != 'RGB':
            image = image.convert('RGB')
        
        if size:
            image = image.copy()
            image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)
        
        buf = BytesIO()
        image.save(buf, 'JPEG')
        return image, buf
```

By properly handling the transparency channel during conversion from RGBA to RGB, we ensure that the correct color values are maintained in the resulting image. This should fix the bug and make the function pass the failing test cases.
