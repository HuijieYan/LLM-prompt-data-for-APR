### Bug Analysis
The buggy function `convert_image` in the `ImagesPipeline` class has issues in handling images with transparent backgrounds. Specifically, when the input image's format is 'PNG' and the mode is 'RGBA', it incorrectly converts the image to 'RGB' without considering the alpha channel.

The bug seems to be caused by the incorrect processing of images with transparency in the 'RGBA' mode, where the function is converting the image to 'RGB' without preserving the alpha channel, resulting in unexpected color values.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, the function should properly handle images with transparency. Specifically, when dealing with images in 'PNG' format and 'RGBA' mode, the function should consider preserving the alpha channel in the output image.

### Corrected Version of the Function
```python
def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
    if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA':
        background = Image.new('RGBA', image.size, (255, 255, 255, 255))  # Add alpha channel for background
        background.paste(image, (0, 0), image)  # Paste the original image on the new RGBA background
        image = background.convert('RGB')  # Convert the image to RGB
    elif image.mode != 'RGB':
        image = image.convert('RGB')

    if size:
        image = image.copy()
        image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)

    buf = BytesIO()
    image.save(buf, 'JPEG')
    return image, buf
```

By pasting the original image onto a new RGBA background with an alpha channel, we ensure that the transparency is preserved when converting the image to RGB. This corrected version should pass the failing test cases and produce the expected output values.
