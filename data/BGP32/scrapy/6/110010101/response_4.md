### Analysis
1. The buggy function `convert_image` is part of the `ImagesPipeline` class. It is responsible for converting images to a specified format and size.
2. The function has logic to convert images to RGB format, handle transparency for PNG images, and generate thumbnails with a specified size.
3. The error occurs when converting an image with transparency to RGB mode. The cause seems to be incorrect handling of the transparency channel during conversion, leading to unexpected color values.
4. To fix the bug, we need to properly handle the conversion of RGBA images to RGB while maintaining the correct color values.

### Bug Fix Strategy
1. When the input image has format 'PNG' and mode 'RGBA', we need to create a new RGB image with a white background and then paste the original RGBA image onto it to properly handle transparency.
2. We should ensure that the conversion from RGBA to RGB retains the correct color values, especially when dealing with transparency.
3. The images should be updated correctly when resizing for thumbnails to maintain image quality.

### Bug-Free Version of the Buggy Function

```python
class ImagesPipeline(FilesPipeline):
    def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
        if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA':
            background = Image.new('RGB', image.size, (255, 255, 255))
            background.paste(image, (0, 0), image)
            image = background
        elif image.mode != 'RGB':
            image = image.convert('RGB')
        
        if size:
            image = image.copy()
            image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)
        
        buf = BytesIO()
        image.save(buf, 'JPEG')
        return image, buf
```

### Explanation
1. In the updated version, when the image format is 'PNG' and mode is 'RGBA', we create a new RGB image with a white background and then paste the original RGBA image onto it properly handling transparency.
2. The conversion from RGBA to RGB mode is now done correctly to preserve all color channels.
3. The changes ensure that the generated thumbnails maintain image quality and aspect ratio.
