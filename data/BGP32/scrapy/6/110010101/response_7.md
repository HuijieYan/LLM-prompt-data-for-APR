### Analysis
The buggy function `convert_image` in the `ImagesPipeline` class is supposed to handle image conversion and resizing. The error message indicates that the RGB values of the converted image are different than expected, causing the test to fail.

### Bugs in the Buggy Function
1. The condition `if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA'` is not handling the transparency case correctly, leading to incorrect color conversion.
2. When pasting the image onto a background, the correct `mask` parameter is not used.
3. The function is saving the image as JPEG unconditionally, regardless of the original image format.

### Bug Cause
The bug is primarily caused by the incorrect handling of RGBA images with transparency. The function pastes the transparent image onto a white background, which results in incorrect RGB values. Additionally, the forced conversion to JPEG without considering the original format leads to unexpected results.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug
1. When dealing with RGBA images, the transparency should be taken into account for correct color representation.
2. Instead of pasting the image onto a white background, the image should be retained as is, or the transparency should be handled appropriately.
3. The image should be saved in the same format as the original, rather than unconditionally converting it to JPEG.

### Corrected Version of the Function
```python
class ImagesPipeline(FilesPipeline):
    def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
        if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA':
            # Create a new image with same size but RGB 
            image = image.convert('RGB')

        if size:
            image = image.copy()
            image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)

        buf = BytesIO()
        # Save the image in the same format as the original 
        image.save(buf, format=image.format)
        return image, buf
```

By converting the RGBA image to RGB directly without pasting it on a background and saving the image in the same format as the original, the corrected function should pass the failing test cases and handle image conversions correctly.
