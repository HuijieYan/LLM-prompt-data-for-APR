### Explanation
The buggy function is failing to correctly handle images with mode 'P' (palette color). The bug occurs when the function tries to convert an image with mode 'P' to an RGB format while keeping the transparency channel. This results in the incorrect conversion of colors and causes the failing test case.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to modify the conversion logic for images with mode 'P' to properly handle transparency channels. We should ensure that the transparency information is preserved during the conversion process.

### The corrected version of the buggy function
```python
def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
    if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA':
        background = Image.new('RGBA', image.size, (255, 255, 255))
        background.paste(image, image)
        image = background.convert('RGB')
    elif image.mode == 'P':
        image = image.convert('RGBA')
        image = image.convert('RGB', palette=Image.ADAPTIVE)
    
    if size:
        image = image.copy()
        image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)
    
    buf = BytesIO()
    image.save(buf, 'JPEG')
    return image, buf
```

By applying the corrected version of the `convert_image` function above, the bug should be resolved, and the failing test case should now pass successfully.
