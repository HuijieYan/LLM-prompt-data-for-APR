### Analysis
1. The buggy function `convert_image` is supposed to handle image conversions, including changing the format, mode, and size of the input image. 
2. The bug seems to be related to incorrect handling of RGBA images when converting to RGB.
3. The failing test case is specifically testing the conversion of RGBA to RGB images, and the bug causes a discrepancy in the color values.
4. The bug is likely caused by incorrect handling of transparency in RGBA images when converting to RGB.
5. To fix the bug, the function needs to properly handle RGBA images during conversion to RGB.

### Bug Fix
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that transparency in RGBA images is correctly handled when converting to RGB. This involves creating a new background with the desired color to replace transparent areas before converting to RGB.

Here is the corrected version of the `convert_image` function:

```python
def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
    if image.mode == 'RGBA':
        background = Image.new('RGB', image.size, (255, 255, 255))
        background.paste(image, (0, 0), image)
        image = background
    
    if size:
        image = image.copy()
        image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)

    buf = BytesIO()
    image.save(buf, 'JPEG')
    return image, buf
```

This fixed version ensures that when the input image is RGBA, it creates a new RGB background with a white color and pastes the RGBA image onto it before converting to RGB. This approach preserves the color values as expected and should pass the failing test cases.
