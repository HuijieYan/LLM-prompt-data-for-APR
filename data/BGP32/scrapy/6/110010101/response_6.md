### Analysis
1. The buggy function `convert_image` is part of the `ImagesPipeline` class and is responsible for image processing tasks such as converting images to RGB format and resizing them.
2. The bug is likely related to the conditional statements that handle different image formats and modes.
3. The failing test indicates that the function is not correctly converting images as expected, leading to discrepancies in the output colors.
4. To fix the bug, we need to adjust the image conversion logic based on the input image format and mode to ensure consistent behavior.
5. The corrected version of the function is provided below.

### Correction
```python
from PIL import Image
from cStringIO import StringIO as BytesIO

class ImagesPipeline(FilesPipeline):
    """
    Abstract pipeline that implement the image thumbnail generation logic
    """

    def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
        if image.mode == 'RGBA':
            if image.format == 'PNG':
                background = Image.new('RGBA', image.size, (255, 255, 255))
                background.paste(image, (0, 0), image)
                image = background.convert('RGB')
            else:
                image = image.convert('RGB')
        else:
            image = image.convert('RGB')

        if size:
            image = image.copy()
            image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)

        buf = BytesIO()
        image.save(buf, 'JPEG')
        return image, buf
```

This corrected version of the `convert_image` function should now correctly handle images with different formats and modes, ensuring that the output colors match the expected values in the failing test cases.
