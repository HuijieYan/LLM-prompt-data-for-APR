### Analysis
1. **Bug Location**: The bug is located in the `convert_image` function within the `ImagesPipeline` class.
   
2. **Error Message**: The error message shows that the `getcolors()` method is returning different values than expected.

3. **Expected Input/Output**:
    - For case 1, the input image should be converted to RGB format with no change in size.
    - For case 2, a thumbnail of size (10, 10) should be created.
    - For case 3, the input PNG image with RGBA mode should be converted to RGB.
    - For case 4, the input PNG image that is initially converted to palette mode should be correctly handled.

### Cause of the Bug
The bug occurs due to incorrect handling of image mode conversion and thumbnail creation in the function. Specifically:
- The function incorrectly pastes the image onto a new RGBA background in the case of PNG format and RGBA mode, leading to a wrong output.
- The conversion to RGB format and thumbnail creation is not being done properly, leading to discrepancies in results.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug
To fix the bug, we need to ensure correct handling of image conversions and thumbnail creation based on the image format and mode. Specifically:
- Handle PNG images with RGBA mode correctly by converting them to RGB format.
- Ensure that thumbnail creation maintains the correct image size ratio and mode.
- Implement proper image conversions based on the image format and mode.

### Corrected Version of the Function
```python
from PIL import Image
from cStringIO import StringIO as BytesIO
from PIL import ImageOps

class ImagesPipeline(FilesPipeline):
    """
    Abstract pipeline that implement the image thumbnail generation logic
    
        
    """

    def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
        if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA':
            image = image.convert('RGB')
        elif image.mode != 'RGB':
            image = image.convert('RGB')
        
        if size:
            image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)
        
        buf = BytesIO()
        image.save(buf, 'JPEG')
        return image, buf
```

By fixing the image mode handling and thumbnail creation logic in the `convert_image` function, we can ensure that the function produces the correct output for the given test cases.
