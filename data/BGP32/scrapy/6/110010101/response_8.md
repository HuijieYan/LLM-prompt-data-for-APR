### Analysis
1. The `convert_image` function within the `ImagesPipeline` class is supposed to convert images to RGB mode and generate thumbnails.
2. The bug seems to be occurring when dealing with PNG images in RGBA mode while pasting them onto a white background.
3. The error message indicates a mismatch in color values after conversion.
4. The bug seems to be in the handling of transparency when converting RGBA images to RGB.
5. To fix the bug, we need to properly handle transparency by considering the alpha channel in RGBA images while pasting them onto a white background.

### Bug Fix
Here is the corrected version of the `convert_image` function:

```python
def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
    if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA':
        background = Image.new('RGBA', image.size, (255, 255, 255, 255))
        background.paste(image, (0, 0), image)
        image = background.convert('RGB')
    elif image.mode != 'RGB':
        image = image.convert('RGB')

    if size:
        image = image.copy()
        image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)

    buf = BytesIO()
    image.save(buf, 'JPEG')
    return image, buf
```

This corrected version properly handles the transparency of RGBA images when converting them to RGB by pasting them onto a white background with alpha values. This fix should address the bug and ensure the function behaves as expected for all test cases.
