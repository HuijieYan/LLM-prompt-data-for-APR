### Analysis
The buggy function `convert_image` is expected to take an image as input, perform some image processing operations, and then return the modified image and a buffer containing the image data. The function is responsible for converting image formats, adjusting image modes, and resizing images.

The error message indicates that there is a difference in the colors of the images before and after conversion, particularly in the RGBA to RGB conversion. This suggests that there might be an issue with the RGBA to RGB conversion logic in the function. 

### Bug Cause
1. The bug is caused by the incorrect handling of transparency in the RGBA to RGB conversion section of the function.
2. The current implementation of converting RGBA to RGB discards the alpha channel without properly adjusting the RGB values based on the transparency level.
3. As a result, the output RGB values in the converted image might not accurately reflect the original RGBA values, leading to a mismatch in the expected colors.

### Approach to Fix
1. To fix the bug, we need to modify the RGBA to RGB conversion logic to properly blend the transparency values into RGB values.
2. We can achieve this by creating a new image with a white background (since an RGB image cannot have transparency) and blending the RGBA values onto this background, taking into account the alpha channel values.

### Corrected Version
```python
def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
    if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA':
        background = Image.new('RGBA', image.size, (255, 255, 255, 255))  # Create a white background with full opacity
        image = Image.alpha_composite(background, image)  # Blend the original image onto the white background
        image = image.convert('RGB')  # Convert the blended image to RGB
    
    elif image.mode != 'RGB':
        image = image.convert('RGB')

    if size:
        image = image.copy()
        image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)

    buf = BytesIO()
    image.save(buf, 'JPEG')
    return image, buf
```

In the corrected version, we create a white background with full opacity for blending the RGBA image. The `Image.alpha_composite` function is used to blend the original image onto the white background while preserving transparency information. This approach ensures that the RGBA image is properly converted to RGB without losing color information due to transparency.
