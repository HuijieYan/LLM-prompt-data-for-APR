### Analysis
1. The buggy function `convert_image` is part of a class `ImagesPipeline` that inherits from `FilesPipeline`.
2. The function is responsible for converting images to the desired format and size.
3. The bug is causing incorrect conversion of images, specifically when dealing with PNG images in RGBA mode.
4. The buggy function is incorrectly handling transparency in RGBA images when converting to RGB.
5. The bug occurs when converting an RGBA image to RGB by pasting the original image onto a new background. This results in incorrect color values due to transparency.
6. To fix the bug, we need to address the handling of transparency during the conversion of RGBA images to RGB.

### Fix Strategy
1. For PNG images in RGBA mode, we need to create a new RGBA image with a white background.
2. Paste the original RGBA image on the white background to blend the transparency properly.
3. Convert the blended image to RGB mode to ensure consistency.
4. Update the function to handle different image modes correctly to ensure accurate conversion.

### The corrected version of the function
```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: scrapy/pipelines/images.py

# The declaration of the class containing the corrected function
class ImagesPipeline(FilesPipeline):
    """
    Abstract pipeline that implement the image thumbnail generation logic
    
        
    """

    def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
        if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA':
            background = Image.new('RGB', image.size, (255, 255, 255))  # Create a white RGB background
            background.paste(image, mask=image.split()[3])  # Paste the original image on the background with alpha mask
            image = background.convert('RGB')  # Convert the blended image to RGB
        elif image.mode != 'RGB':
            image = image.convert('RGB')
    
        if size:
            image = image.copy()
            image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)
    
        buf = BytesIO()
        image.save(buf, format='JPEG')  # Specify the format when saving the image
        buf.seek(0)  # Reset the buffer position for reading
        return image, buf
```

By updating the `convert_image` function as described above, the corrected version should now handle RGBA images with transparency correctly and pass all the provided test cases.
