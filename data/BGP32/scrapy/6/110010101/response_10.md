### Analysis
1. The buggy function `convert_image` in the `ImagesPipeline` class is designed to convert images to RGB format and create image thumbnails. The bug seems to be related to the conversion logic for PNG images with an RGBA mode.
2. The bug occurs when trying to convert images with RGBA mode to RGB format. The background image is created with RGBA mode instead of RGB, which leads to incorrect conversion.
3. The error message indicates that the converted image does not match the expected colors due to the incorrect conversion step. The bug affects cases where the input image is in PNG format with RGBA mode.
4. To fix the bug, we need to ensure that when converting images with RGBA mode, the background is created in RGB mode, and the conversion is handled correctly.
5. Below is the corrected version of the `convert_image` function:

### Corrected Version
```python
def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
    if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA':
        background = Image.new('RGB', image.size, (255, 255, 255))
        background.paste(image, (0, 0), image)
        image = background.convert('RGB')
    elif image.mode != 'RGB':
        image = image.convert('RGB')

    if size:
        image = image.copy()
        image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)

    buf = BytesIO()
    image.save(buf, 'JPEG')
    return image, buf
```

By creating the background image with RGB mode and using the correct parameters for the `paste` method, we ensure that the conversion from PNG with RGBA mode to RGB works correctly. This corrected version should address the bug and pass the failing test cases.
