### Analyzing the buggy function
The `convert_image` function is part of a class `ImagesPipeline` which implements image thumbnail generation logic in the context of `FilesPipeline`. The function takes an `image` as input and optionally a `size` parameter. It checks the format and mode of the input image and converts it to RGB mode if necessary. It then creates a thumbnail if a size is provided and saves the image as a JPEG in a BytesIO buffer.

### Error location
The error seems to be related to the conversion of images with transparency from RGBA to RGB. The background needs to be created correctly to handle transparent parts of the image.

### Cause of the bug
The bug in the function is primarily due to the incorrect creation of the `background` image when the input image has PNG format and RGBA mode. The transparent areas of the input image are not handled correctly and as a result, the colors are being transformed incorrectly when converting from RGBA to RGB.

### Strategy for fixing the bug
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that transparent areas in the input image are handled properly when creating the `background` image. This involves creating a white background image with an alpha channel to accommodate transparency during the conversion process.

### Corrected version of the function

```python
# The corrected version of the buggy function
def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
    if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA':
        background = Image.new('RGBA', image.size, (255, 255, 255, 255))  # Create a white background with alpha channel
        background.paste(image, (0, 0), image)  # Paste the input image onto the background
        image = background.convert('RGB')  # Convert the image to RGB
        
    elif image.mode != 'RGB':
        image = image.convert('RGB')
    
    if size:
        image = image.copy()
        image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)
    
    buf = BytesIO()
    image.save(buf, 'JPEG')
    return image, buf
```

By correctly handling transparent areas in the input image when creating the background, the corrected function should now convert images with transparency from RGBA to RGB accurately. This should resolve the failing test case and meet the expected input/output values.
