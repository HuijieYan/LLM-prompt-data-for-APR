### Analysis
- The buggy function `convert_image` is part of a class `ImagesPipeline` that extends `FilesPipeline`.
- The function is responsible for converting images to either RGB format or resizing them.
- The buggy function has a bug where it incorrectly handles images in PNG format with RGBA mode.
- The bug causes incorrect color conversion and affects the transparency of the images.

### Bug
The bug occurs when processing images in PNG format with RGBA mode. The buggy code attempts to convert the image to RGB format by creating a new image with a white background and pasting the original image onto it. However, the code incorrectly pastes the original image onto the white background, resulting in an incorrect color transformation. This leads to a failure in the test case involving transparent PNG images.

### Solution Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to correctly paste the original image onto the white background and convert it to RGB format without altering the transparency of the original image.

### Corrected Version
```python
def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
    if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA':
        background = Image.new('RGBA', image.size, (255, 255, 255, 255))  # Include alpha channel for transparency
        background.paste(image, (0, 0), image)  # Paste with transparency
        image = background.convert('RGB')
    elif image.mode != 'RGB':
        image = image.convert('RGB')

    if size:
        image = image.copy()
        image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)

    buf = BytesIO()
    image.save(buf, 'JPEG')
    return image, buf
```

With this correction, the function now correctly handles images in PNG format with RGBA mode by preserving transparency during the conversion to RGB format. This change ensures that the colors and transparency are maintained as expected.
