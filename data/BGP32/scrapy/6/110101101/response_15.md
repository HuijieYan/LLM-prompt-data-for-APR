### Bug Analysis:
The bug in the `convert_image` function lies in the conditional check for image format and mode. The bug causes incorrect conversions and image handling, leading to failing tests in certain scenarios.

1. In Case 1, the function should simply convert the image to RGB format as it is already in RGB format, but it unnecessarily checks for PNG format and RGBA mode.
2. In Case 2, the function does not correctly handle resizing the image to a thumbnail with specific dimensions, resulting in an incorrect thumbnail size.
3. In Case 3, the function incorrectly handles images with PNG format and RGBA mode by converting them to RGB mode without properly handling transparency.
4. In Case 4, the function mishandles images with P mode (palette) by not considering the palette mode during conversion, resulting in incorrect image mode conversion.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug:
1. Refactor the conditional checks and conversions based on the image format and modes to handle each case correctly.
2. Ensure proper handling of transparency and thumbnail resizing.
3. Take into account different image modes like RGBA and P mode during conversion.

### Corrected Function:
```python
def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
    if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA':
        background = Image.new('RGBA', image.size, (255, 255, 255))
        background.paste(image, (0, 0), image)
        image = background.convert('RGB')
    elif image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'P':
        image = image.convert('RGBA')
    elif image.mode != 'RGB':
        image = image.convert('RGB')

    if size:
        image = image.copy()
        image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)

    buf = BytesIO()
    image.save(buf, 'JPEG')
    return image, buf
```

By making these changes, the function now handles different scenarios correctly and should pass the failing tests with the expected outputs.
