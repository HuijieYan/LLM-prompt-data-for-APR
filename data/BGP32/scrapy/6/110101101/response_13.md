### Analysis
The buggy function `convert_image` has two main issues:
1. In the condition where the image format is 'PNG' and the mode is 'RGBA', the background image is created with the incorrect mode of 'RGBA' instead of 'RGB'. This can lead to an incorrect conversion of the image.
2. When saving the image, it is specified to be saved as 'JPEG' format regardless of the original format of the image, which may cause issues when saving images that were originally in other formats.

### Bug Explanation
1. In Case 3, when the input image format is 'PNG' and the mode is 'RGBA', the code wrongly sets the background mode to 'RGBA', leading to a subsequent conversion to 'RGB' that removes the transparency, affecting the final image.
2. In all cases, the images are saved in 'JPEG' format regardless of their original format, which is incorrect and may lead to unexpected results.

### Fix Strategy
1. Correct the mode of the background image in the case of 'PNG' format and 'RGBA' mode to 'RGB' for correct conversion.
2. Save the converted image in the same format as the original image to preserve its characteristics.

### Corrected Function
```python
def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
    if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA':
        background = Image.new('RGB', image.size, (255, 255, 255))
        background.paste(image, (0, 0), image)
        image = background.convert('RGB')
    elif image.mode != 'RGB':
        image = image.convert('RGB')

    if size:
        image = image.copy()
        image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)

    buf = BytesIO()
    image.save(buf, image.format)
    return image, buf
``` 

By making these adjustments, the `convert_image` function should now correctly handle the image format, mode, and saving process, ensuring that the images are converted and saved as expected.
