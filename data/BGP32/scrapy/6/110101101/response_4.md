### Potential Error Locations:
1. The condition for converting an image with format `'PNG'` and mode `'RGBA'` is likely causing issues.
2. The `paste` method usage might be incorrect.
3. The conversion to RGB mode might not be handling transparency correctly.

### Bug Explanation:
The bug occurs when the function attempts to convert an image with format `'PNG'` and mode `'RGBA'`. The function creates a new RGBA background, pastes the original image onto it, and then converts it to RGB mode. However, the `paste` method is used incorrectly, resulting in the original image being pasted back onto itself, causing unexpected behavior.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
1. Update the way the background image is created and pasted.
2. Ensure that transparency is handled correctly when converting images to RGB mode.
3. Verify that the thumbnail generation maintains the correct image ratio.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
    if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA':
        background = Image.new('RGB', image.size, (255, 255, 255))
        background.paste(image, (0, 0), image)
        image = background
    else:
        image = image.convert('RGB')

    if size:
        image = image.copy()
        image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)

    buf = BytesIO()
    image.save(buf, 'JPEG')
    return image, buf
``` 

By adjusting the way the background is created and pasted, addressing the transparency issue correctly, and ensuring proper handling of image conversion, the corrected function should now pass the failing test cases and provide the expected output values.
