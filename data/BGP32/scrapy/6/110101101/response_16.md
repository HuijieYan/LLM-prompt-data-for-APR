### Identified Bug:
The bug in the `convert_image` function is in the conditional check for PNG images with RGBA mode. When the condition `if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA':` is met, it creates a new image with RGBA mode and then tries to paste the original image onto it. This causes an issue because the original image has an RGBA mode, and pasting an RGBA image onto an RGBA image results in alpha blending, which leads to unexpected colors if the background is not transparent. It should paste onto an RGB background instead.

### Bug Cause:
When the buggy function processes a PNG image with RGBA mode, it creates a new RGBA background image and pastes the original image onto it before converting to RGB. The incorrect pasting operation results in alpha blending that affects the color values in the final image, causing the failing test cases.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that when working with PNG images in RGBA mode, we paste the image onto an RGB background to avoid alpha blending issues. Additionally, the conversion logic needs to be adjusted to preserve the color quality of the image during the conversion.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
    if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA':
        # Create an RGB background image to paste the RGBA image onto
        background = Image.new('RGB', image.size, (255, 255, 255))
        background.paste(image, (0, 0), image)  # Paste the original image without blending
        image = background.convert('RGB')
    elif image.mode != 'RGB':
        image = image.convert('RGB')

    if size:
        image = image.copy()
        image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)

    buf = BytesIO()
    image.save(buf, 'JPEG')
    return image, buf
```

By correcting the pasting operation for PNG images with RGBA mode and ensuring proper color preservation during conversion, the function should now pass the failing test cases and produce the expected output.
