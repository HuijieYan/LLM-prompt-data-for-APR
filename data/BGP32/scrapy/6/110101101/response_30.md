### Bug Explanation

The bug in the `convert_image` function lies in the conditional check for PNG images with RGBA mode. The current code checks if the format is PNG and the mode is RGBA, and then tries to convert it to RGB by pasting the image on a new RGBA background. However, the actual intention should have been to convert the RGBA image to RGB directly without modifying the transparency, which is lost in the current implementation. This is why the failing tests are indicating incorrect modes and colors after conversion.

### Bug Fix Strategy

To fix the bug, we should modify the code to directly convert RGBA images to RGB without altering the transparency. The conversion process should be designed to maintain the transparency information during the transformation.

### Code Fix

Here is the corrected version of the `convert_image` function:

```python
# The corrected version of the buggy function
def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
    if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA':
        background = Image.new('RGB', image.size, (255, 255, 255))
        background.paste(image, (0, 0), image)
        image = background
    elif image.mode != 'RGB':
        image = image.convert('RGB')

    if size:
        image = image.copy()
        image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)

    buf = BytesIO()
    image.save(buf, 'JPEG')
    return image, buf
```

By making these adjustments, we ensure that when converting RGBA images to RGB, the transparency data is preserved, and the image is converted correctly without losing important information. This should make the function pass the failing tests and produce the expected results.
