### Explanation:
The bug in the `convert_image` function occurs when the input Image object is in PNG format and RGBA mode. In this case, the function incorrectly converts the image to RGB by creating a new background image with RGB mode and pasting the original image onto it. The bug lies in the line `background.paste(image, image)` where `image` should be a tuple of coordinates representing the position to paste the image, but instead, `image` is used twice, causing an error. Additionally, the line `image.save(buf, 'JPEG')` should use the original image as input, not the converted one, to save the image in the correct format.

### Strategy for fixing the bug:
1. Create a background image with the mode 'RGB'.
2. Paste the original image onto the background image.
3. Convert the background image to RGB if the original image was in RGBA mode.
4. As the last step, save the original image to the buffer as a JPEG.

### The corrected version of the function:
```python
def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
    if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA':
        background = Image.new('RGB', image.size, (255, 255, 255))
        background.paste(image, (0, 0))
        image = background.convert('RGB')
    elif image.mode != 'RGB':
        image = image.convert('RGB')

    if size:
        image = image.copy()
        image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)

    buf = BytesIO()
    image.save(buf, 'JPEG')
    return image, buf
``` 

By making these adjustments, the function should now correctly handle images with different modes and formats, passing all the failing test cases.
