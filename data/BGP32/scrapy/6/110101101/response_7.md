### Identified Bug:
The bug occurs in the `convert_image` function when handling images with format "PNG" and mode "RGBA". The function incorrectly converts such images to "RGB" without properly handling the transparency channel resulting in loss of information.

### Cause of the Bug:
1. In the buggy function, when the condition `image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA'` is met, it creates a new background image filled with white color and pastes the original image onto it. However, the `paste` method should take the image and the mask, not the same image twice.
2. After converting the background image to "RGB", it keeps the alpha channel information from the original image by setting its values to white.
3. This causes the loss of the transparency information in the resulting image, leading to incorrect output for images with transparent areas.

### Solution:
To fix the bug and preserve the transparency information when converting PNG RGBA images to RGB, we need to correctly handle the alpha channel. One way to achieve this is by using the `paste` method with a mask that includes the alpha channel information.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
    if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA':
        background = Image.new('RGBA', image.size, (255, 255, 255, 255))
        background.paste(image, (0, 0), image)
        image = background.convert('RGB')
    elif image.mode != 'RGB':
        image = image.convert('RGB')

    if size:
        image = image.copy()
        image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)

    buf = BytesIO()
    image.save(buf, 'JPEG')
    return image, buf
```

By using `background.paste(image, (0, 0), image)`, we correctly handle the transparency channel when converting PNG RGBA images to RGB, ensuring that the resulting image retains the transparency information.
