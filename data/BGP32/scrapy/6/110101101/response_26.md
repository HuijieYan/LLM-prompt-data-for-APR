### 3. Explanation of the Bug

The bug in the `convert_image` function arises from incorrect handling of images with transparency. When the input image has a format of 'PNG' and a mode of 'RGBA', the function is supposed to create a new image with a white background, paste the original image onto it, and then convert it to RGB mode. However, there is a mistake in the code where `background.paste(image, image)` should be `background.paste(image, (0, 0), image)`. This error leads to the original image not being properly pasted onto the white background.

### 4. Fixing the Bug

To fix the bug, we need to correct the paste operation where the original image is pasted onto the white background. By changing `background.paste(image, image)` to `background.paste(image, (0, 0), image)`, we ensure that the original image is correctly positioned on the new background. Additionally, we should also handle the case where the image mode is 'RGBA' but the format is not 'PNG' to prevent unnecessary conversion to RGB mode.

### Corrected Version of the Function

Here is the corrected version of the `convert_image` function:

```python
def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
    if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA':
        background = Image.new('RGBA', image.size, (255, 255, 255))
        background.paste(image, (0, 0), image)
        image = background.convert('RGB')
    elif image.mode == 'RGBA' and image.format != 'PNG':
        image = image.convert('RGB')

    if size:
        image = image.copy()
        image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)

    buf = BytesIO()
    image.save(buf, 'JPEG')
    return image, buf
```

By making this correction, the function should now handle images with transparency correctly, ensuring that the tests pass as expected.
