### Bug Explanation
The bug in the `convert_image` function lies in the conditional statement that checks if the image format is 'PNG' and the mode is 'RGBA'. When this condition is met, the function attempts to create a new background image, paste the original image onto it, convert it to 'RGB', and assign it back to the original image variable. However, the `paste` method expects a tuple of coordinates (left, top), not the image itself, which results in an error.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to correctly use the `paste` method by providing the correct tuple of coordinates. Additionally, we can improve the image conversion logic to handle all cases more efficiently.

### Corrected Function
Here is the corrected version of the `convert_image` function:

```python
def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
    if (image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA'):
        background = Image.new('RGBA', image.size, (255, 255, 255))
        background.paste(image, (0, 0), image)
        image = background.convert('RGB')
    elif image.mode != 'RGB':
        image = image.convert('RGB')

    if size:
        image = image.copy()
        image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)

    buf = BytesIO()
    image.save(buf, 'JPEG')
    return image, buf
```

With this correction, the function should now correctly handle the conversion of images to the desired format and mode without any runtime errors. The function should pass the failing test cases as well.
