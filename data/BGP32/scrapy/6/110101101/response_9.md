### Bug Explanation
The bug occurs in the `convert_image` function when the image format is PNG and the mode is RGBA. In this case, the function attempts to create a new image with a white background and then pastes the original image onto it. However, the `paste` method expects the second argument to be a tuple representing the location to paste the image, not the image itself. This causes the function to fail when trying to fix the format and mode of the image.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix this bug, we need to correct the way the background image is created and pasted in the `convert_image` function. Instead of passing the image as the location to paste, we should provide (0,0) as the location to paste the image onto the background.

### Corrected Version of the Function
```python
# The corrected version of the buggy function
def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
    if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA':
        background = Image.new('RGBA', image.size, (255, 255, 255))
        background.paste(image, (0, 0))  # Corrected the paste call
        image = background.convert('RGB')
    elif image.mode != 'RGB':
        image = image.convert('RGB')

    if size:
        image = image.copy()
        image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)

    buf = BytesIO()
    image.save(buf, 'JPEG')
    return image, buf
``` 

With this corrected version, the function should now correctly handle the case where the image format is PNG and the mode is RGBA, ensuring the tests pass successfully.
