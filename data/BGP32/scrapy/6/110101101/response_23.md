### Analyze the buggy function
The `convert_image` function in the `ImagesPipeline` class processes image objects, converting them to RGB mode and resizing them if needed. The main issue is the conditional check for PNG images with RGBA mode. The function incorrectly converts these images to RGB without considering the transparency layer, leading to incorrect image processing and failing tests.

### Identify potential error locations
The bug occurs when handling PNG images with RGBA mode. The function incorrectly converts them to RGB mode without preserving the alpha channel, resulting in incorrect image output and failing tests.

### Explain the cause of the bug
The bug stems from the conditional check that converts PNG images with RGBA mode to RGB mode without considering the transparency information. This oversight leads to loss of transparency, affecting the thumbnail generation and causing the failing test cases.

### Suggest a strategy for fixing the bug
To fix this bug, we need to modify the conditional block that handles PNG images with RGBA mode. Instead of directly converting them to RGB, we should create a new RGBA image with a white background to preserve transparency. Then, convert this new image to RGB and proceed with thumbnail generation, maintaining the alpha channel information.

### Corrected version of the function
```python
def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
    if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA':
        background = Image.new('RGBA', image.size, (255, 255, 255, 255))
        background.paste(image, (0, 0), image)
        image = background.convert('RGB')
    elif image.mode != 'RGB':
        image = image.convert('RGB')

    if size:
        image = image.copy()
        image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)

    buf = BytesIO()
    image.save(buf, 'JPEG')
    return image, buf
```

This corrected version ensures that PNG images with RGBA mode are handled correctly by creating a new RGBA image with a white background and then converting it to RGB. This approach preserves transparency and fixes the bug that caused the failing test cases.
