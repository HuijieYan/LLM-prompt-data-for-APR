The buggy function `convert_image` has several issues:
1. In the conditional check `if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA':`, it attempts to convert the image to RGB format by creating a new image (`background`) and pasting the original image onto it. This logic is incorrect since the paste operation requires a single argument. It should be `background.paste(image, (0, 0), image)` instead of `background.paste(image, image)`.
2. After checking the image format and mode, the function converts the image to RGB format if it is not already in RGB format. However, the logic in this part could be simplified and made more efficient.

To fix the bug, we will adjust the code accordingly to meet the expected input/output values and address the issues mentioned above. Here is the corrected version:

```python
# Fixed version of the convert_image function
def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
    if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA':
        background = Image.new('RGBA', image.size, (255, 255, 255))
        background.paste(image, (0, 0), image)
        image = background.convert('RGB')
    else:
        image = image.convert('RGB')

    if size:
        image = image.copy()
        image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)

    buf = BytesIO()
    image.save(buf, 'JPEG')
    return image, buf
```

The corrected version of the function addresses the issues mentioned and should now successfully convert images to RGB format where necessary and maintain the expected input/output values for all the provided test cases.
