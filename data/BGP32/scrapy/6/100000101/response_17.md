The bug in the provided function lies in the condition checking for image format and mode. The conditional checks for fixing the image format to 'RGB' if it is in 'PNG' format and 'RGBA' mode are incorrect. The issue arises from using `image` as an argument for the paste method, which expects a tuple of x and y coordinates as the second argument, not the image itself.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the conditional checks and the image pasting logic accordingly. Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
    if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA':
        background = Image.new('RGB', image.size, (255, 255, 255))
        background.paste(image, (0, 0), image)
        image = background
    elif image.mode != 'RGB':
        image = image.convert('RGB')

    if size:
        image = image.copy()
        image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)

    buf = BytesIO()
    image.save(buf, 'JPEG')
    return image, buf
```

This corrected version of the function addresses the issues in conditional checks and fixes the image pasting logic. It should now satisfy all the expected input/output values for the provided test cases.
