The buggy function has the following issues based on the expected input/output values:
1. The condition in the first if statement to convert PNG images with RGBA mode to RGB mode is incorrect.
2. In the same if statement, the `paste` method is used incorrectly.
3. The second if statement to convert images to RGB mode if they are not in RGB mode is redundant and can be removed.
4. The final save method to save the image in JPEG format is misleading and should be corrected.

To fix the issues, the condition for converting PNG images with RGBA mode to RGB mode should be corrected to only check for PNG format and RGBA mode. The `paste` method should be used in a correct manner to paste the original image onto a new background image. Redundant code to convert images to RGB mode can be removed. Lastly, the save method should be adjusted to save the image in JPEG format.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
    if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA':
        background = Image.new('RGB', image.size, (255, 255, 255))
        background.paste(image, (0, 0), image)
        image = background
    if size:
        image = image.copy()
        image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)
    buf = BytesIO()
    image.save(buf, 'JPEG')
    return image, buf
``` 

This corrected version of the function should now correctly handle the image conversions and save the image in the desired JPEG format while satisfying all the provided test cases.
