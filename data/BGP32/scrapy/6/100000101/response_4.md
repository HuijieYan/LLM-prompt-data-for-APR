The bug in the provided function lies in the condition for converting images with format 'PNG' and mode 'RGBA'. The background image is pasted incorrectly, leading to an incorrect conversion result. Additionally, the condition to convert images with modes other than 'RGB' is also flawed.

To fix the bug, I will correct the pasting of the background image and improve the conditional statements for conversion. Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
from PIL import Image
from cStringIO import StringIO as BytesIO

def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
    if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA':
        background = Image.new('RGBA', image.size, (255, 255, 255, 255))
        background.paste(image, (0, 0), image)
        image = background.convert('RGB')
    elif image.mode != 'RGB':
        image = image.convert('RGB')

    if size:
        image = image.copy()
        image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)

    buf = BytesIO()
    image.save(buf, 'JPEG')
    return image, buf
```

This corrected version addresses the issues in pasting the background image and the conversion conditions, ensuring that the function operates correctly for all the provided test cases.
