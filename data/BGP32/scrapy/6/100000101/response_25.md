The buggy function has an issue with the condition `if image.mode != 'RGB':` because it does not handle the case when the image mode is not 'RGBA' but it is also not 'RGB'. This can lead to unexpected results when the image mode is different from 'RGBA' or 'RGB'.

To fix this issue, we need to modify the condition to handle the cases where the image mode is neither 'RGBA' nor 'RGB'. We can convert the image to 'RGB' in such cases.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
    if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA':
        background = Image.new('RGBA', image.size, (255, 255, 255))
        background.paste(image, (0, 0))
        image = background.convert('RGB')
    elif image.mode not in ['RGB', 'RGBA']:  # Modify the condition to cover other modes
        image = image.convert('RGB')

    if size:
        image = image.copy()
        image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)

    buf = BytesIO()
    image.save(buf, 'JPEG')
    return image, buf
```

This corrected version handles the case where the image mode is neither 'RGBA' nor 'RGB' by converting the image to 'RGB' mode. It should now satisfy all the expected input/output values for the provided test cases.
