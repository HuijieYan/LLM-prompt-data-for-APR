The bug in the provided code is in the condition where it checks if the image format is 'PNG' and the mode is 'RGBA'. In this condition, when creating a new RGBA image to paste the original image onto, the paste statement is incorrect. It should be `background.paste(image, (0, 0), image)` instead of `background.paste(image, image)`. 

The bug happens because the `paste()` method expects the image to be pasted along with a position tuple as the second argument. If only one argument is provided as in the buggy code, it tries to interpret it as a mask image, leading to the bug.

To fix the bug, we need to correct the paste statement and potentially some other minor issues in the code. Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
    if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA':
        background = Image.new('RGBA', image.size, (255, 255, 255))
        background.paste(image, (0, 0), image)
        image = background.convert('RGB')
    elif image.mode != 'RGB':
        image = image.convert('RGB')

    if size:
        image = image.copy()
        image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)

    buf = BytesIO()
    image.save(buf, 'JPEG')
    return image, buf
```

This corrected version should now handle the cases as expected based on the given input specifications and desired output.
