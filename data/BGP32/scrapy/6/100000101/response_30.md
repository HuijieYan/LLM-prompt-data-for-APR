The buggy function has an issue when checking and converting images with PNG format and RGBA mode. The bug arises due to incorrect usage of the `paste` method of the `Image` class.

To fix the bug, the correct approach is to use the `paste` method with the correct parameters to paste the RGBA image onto a new RGBA background. Additionally, there is a problem with the condition where the image mode is not 'RGB', as the function should convert it to 'RGB' in that case.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
    if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA':
        background = Image.new('RGBA', image.size, (255, 255, 255, 255))
        background.paste(image, (0, 0), image)
        image = background.convert('RGB')
    elif image.mode != 'RGB':
        image = image.convert('RGB')

    if size:
        image = image.copy()
        image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)

    buf = BytesIO()
    image.save(buf, 'JPEG')
    return image, buf
```

This corrected version should now correctly handle images with PNG format and RGBA mode while pasting the image onto a new RGBA background. It also properly converts images to RGB mode when needed.
