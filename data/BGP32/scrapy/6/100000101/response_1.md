The buggy function has a few issues:
1. In the `convert_image` function, there is a condition based on the image format and mode which incorrectly converts the image to RGB if the format is 'PNG' and mode is 'RGBA', but it should actually create a white background for transparency.
2. The `background.paste(image, image)` line has an issue as it should paste the image onto the white background, not itself.

To fix the bugs and satisfy all the expected cases, we can modify the function as follows:

```python
def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
    if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA':
        background = Image.new('RGBA', image.size, (255, 255, 255))
        background.paste(image, (0, 0), mask=image)
        image = background.convert('RGB')
    elif image.mode != 'RGB':
        image = image.convert('RGB')

    if size:
        image = image.copy()
        image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)

    buf = BytesIO()
    image.save(buf, 'JPEG')
    return image, buf
```

This corrected version of the function ensures that the image is properly processed and returned according to the expected input/output values provided.
