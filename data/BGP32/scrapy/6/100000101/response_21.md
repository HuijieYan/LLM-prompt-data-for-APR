The bug in the provided function is that the conditional statement for checking the image format and mode does not correctly handle the case when the image format is 'JPEG' and the mode is not 'RGB'. Additionally, the copying of the image before resizing it with a given size is missing.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that if the image is in 'JPEG' format, it should be converted to 'RGB' regardless of the mode. We also need to add a step to copy the image before resizing it if a size is provided.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
    if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA':
        background = Image.new('RGBA', image.size, (255, 255, 255))
        background.paste(image, image)
        image = background.convert('RGB')
    elif image.format == 'JPEG':
        image = image.convert('RGB')

    image_copy = image.copy()

    if size:
        image_copy.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)

    buf = BytesIO()
    image_copy.save(buf, 'JPEG')
    return image_copy, buf
```

This corrected version of the function should now correctly handle the different cases outlined in the expected values and types provided.
