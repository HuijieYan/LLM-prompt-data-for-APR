The buggy function has multiple issues that need to be fixed to meet the expected input/output values. Here are the identified bugs and their corresponding fixes:

1. When converting the image to JPEG format, the `image.save()` method is being used directly with `image` instead of `buf`. This is causing the function to save the image into `buf` but not returning it. 
2. In the conditional statement checking the image format and mode, the condition for PNG format and RGBA mode should be handled differently as the pasting of the image is incorrect.

Based on these identified issues, below is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
    if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA':
        background = Image.new('RGB', image.size, (255, 255, 255))
        background.paste(image, (0, 0), image)
        image = background
    elif image.mode != 'RGB':
        image = image.convert('RGB')

    if size:
        image = image.copy()
        image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)

    buf = BytesIO()  # Create a BytesIO buffer to save the image
    image.save(buf, 'JPEG')  # Save the image in JPEG format into the buffer
    buf.seek(0)  # Rewind the buffer to the start before returning

    return image, buf
```

By making these modifications to the function, it should now return the correct values based on the expected input/output values mentioned in the cases.
