The bug in the provided function is in the condition where it checks for PNG format with RGBA mode. The function incorrectly pastes the image onto a new background and converts it to RGB, which could result in an incorrect output. Additionally, there is a mistake in using `image` as an argument for the `paste` method instead of `image`, leading to unexpected behavior.

To fix the bug, we should create a new blank image with the desired mode and size, paste the original image onto it, and then convert it to RGB. Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
from PIL import Image
from io import BytesIO

def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
    if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA':
        background = Image.new('RGBA', image.size, (255, 255, 255))
        background.paste(image)
        image = background.convert('RGB')
    elif image.mode != 'RGB':
        image = image.convert('RGB')

    if size:
        image = image.copy()
        image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)

    buf = BytesIO()
    image.save(buf, 'JPEG')
    return image, buf
```

This corrected version ensures that the image is handled correctly based on its format and mode, and the logic for pasting the image onto a background and converting it to RGB is fixed. The function now handles the input parameters according to the expected output values for the given test cases.
