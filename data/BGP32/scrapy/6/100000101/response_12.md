The bug in the provided function lies in the if condition where it checks for the format and mode of the image. The issue arises when the condition `image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA'` is not satisfied, thereby bypassing the conversion of RGBA images to RGB. This leads to incorrect handling of RGBA images.

To fix this bug, we need to ensure that RGBA images are properly converted to RGB images regardless of the image format. Additionally, we should handle the case where the image mode is not RGB by converting it to RGB.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
    if image.mode == 'RGBA':
        background = Image.new('RGB', image.size, (255, 255, 255))
        background.paste(image, (0, 0), image)
        image = background
    elif image.mode != 'RGB':
        image = image.convert('RGB')

    if size:
        image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)

    buf = BytesIO()
    image.save(buf, 'JPEG')
    return image, buf
```

This corrected version of the function ensures that RGBA images are correctly converted to RGB regardless of the format. It also handles the conversion of images to RGB if they are not already in the RGB mode.
