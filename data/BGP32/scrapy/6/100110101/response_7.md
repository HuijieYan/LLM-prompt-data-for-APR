### Analysis
1. The `convert_image` function is intended to process an image by converting it to RGB format if needed, resizing it if a size parameter is provided, and saving it in JPEG format.
2. The function first checks if the image format is PNG and the mode is RGBA. If so, it creates a new RGBA background image filled with white, pastes the original image on top, and then converts it to RGB format.
3. There are a few potential issues:
   - When pasting the original image onto the background, the `paste` method should receive a tuple (0, 0) as the second argument instead of the `image` object.
   - After the conversion to RGB, the function should return both the updated image and the BytesIO buffer containing the image, but it is only returning the image itself.
4. To address the bug, we need to make sure to fix the paste operation and correctly return both the updated image and the buffer.

### Bug Fix
```python
def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
    if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA':
        background = Image.new('RGBA', image.size, (255, 255, 255))
        background.paste(image, (0, 0))
        image = background.convert('RGB')
    elif image.mode != 'RGB':
        image = image.convert('RGB')

    if size:
        image = image.copy()
        image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)

    buf = BytesIO()
    image.save(buf, 'JPEG')
    return image, buf
``` 

By correcting the paste operation and ensuring the function returns both the updated image and the buffer, the issues identified should be resolved.
