### Potential Error Locations
1. The condition checking for PNG format and RGBA mode may not be working as expected.
2. The conversion logic inside the if conditions may not be correct for handling transparency and palette modes of images.
3. The thumbnail generation logic might not be preserving the image ratio properly.

### Bug Explanation
In the failing test case, the bug is revealed when checking the converted image's colors after conversion for transparency cases. The bug causes the colors of the converted image to differ from the expected values. This may be due to improper handling of transparency and palette modes during image conversion inside the `convert_image()` function.

### Bug Fix Strategy
1. Adjust the conditional checks for PNG format and RGBA mode to accurately handle transparency and palette modes.
2. Update the conversion logic within the conditionals to correctly handle different image modes and transparency.
3. Ensure that thumbnail generation maintains the image ratio as stated in the test cases.

### Corrected Function
```python
def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
    if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA':
        background = Image.new('RGB', image.size, (255, 255, 255))
        background.paste(image, (0, 0), image)
        image = background
    elif image.mode != 'RGB':
        image = image.convert('RGB')

    if size:
        image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)

    buf = BytesIO()
    image.save(buf, 'JPEG')
    image = Image.open(BytesIO(buf.getvalue()))
    return image, buf
``` 

By adjusting the conditionals and conversion logic as described above, the fixed function should now correctly handle different image modes, ensuring that the converted images match the expected values in the failing test cases.
