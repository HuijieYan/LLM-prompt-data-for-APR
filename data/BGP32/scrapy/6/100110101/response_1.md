### Analysis
1. The `convert_image` function is designed to convert images to RGB format and optionally resize them using thumbnail. It saves the image as a JPEG format.
2. The bug seems to be in the handling of PNG images with RGBA mode. The function is trying to convert RGBA PNG images with a white background to RGB format, which results in an incorrect color shift due to the white background.
3. The failing test case is when converting a PNG image with RGBA mode and testing the RGB colors. The background white color transformation is causing the bug.
4. To fix the bug, we need to handle RGBA PNG images differently to preserve their transparency while converting them to RGB format.
5. The corrected version of the function will check for PNG and RGBA mode separately and handle the conversion accordingly.

### Correction
```python
def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
    if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA':
        image = image.convert('RGB')  # Convert the RGBA PNG image directly to RGB
    elif image.mode != 'RGB':
        image = image.convert('RGB')

    if size:
        image = image.copy()
        image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)

    buf = BytesIO()
    image.save(buf, 'JPEG')
    return image, buf
``` 

By directly converting the RGBA PNG image to RGB mode, we are preserving the original colors without introducing a white background that distorts the image. This correction should ensure that the failing test case passes and the expected input/output values are satisfied.
