### Explanation:
The bug in the `convert_image` function is related to handling PNG images with RGBA mode. When the image format is PNG and the mode is RGBA, the function is attempting to convert the image to RGB by pasting it on a new RGBA background and then converting it to RGB. This approach is incorrect because the pasting operation may not blend the transparency correctly and the conversion to RGB may result in incorrect colors.

### Bug:
The bug occurs when converting PNG images with RGBA mode to RGB by pasting them on a white background and then converting the image.

### Fix:
Instead of pasting the RGBA image onto a white background and then converting it to RGB, directly convert the RGBA image to RGB without using the pasting operation.

### Corrected Function:
```python
from PIL import Image
from cStringIO import StringIO as BytesIO

def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
    if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA':
        image = image.convert('RGB')
    elif image.mode != 'RGB':
        image = image.convert('RGB')

    if size:
        image = image.copy()
        image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)

    buf = BytesIO()
    image.save(buf, 'JPEG')
    return image, buf
``` 

By making this change, the corrected function will properly handle PNG images with RGBA mode by directly converting them to RGB, which should fix the bug and allow the function to pass the failing test case.
