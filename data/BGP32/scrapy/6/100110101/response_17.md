### Analysis
The buggy function `convert_image` has a logic issue when handling images with format PNG and mode RGBA. The function tries to convert RGBA images to RGB without considering the alpha channel, which results in losing transparency information during the conversion.

### Error
The failing test case involves an image with PNG format and RGBA mode. The expected output is to convert the image to RGB while preserving the color information and handling transparency correctly. However, the buggy function loses the transparency information during the conversion, leading to a mismatch in the test assertion related to color values.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, the function should handle RGBA images differently to preserve transparency. One way to address this is by considering the alpha channel in the image conversion process, ensuring that transparency is maintained during the conversion.

### The corrected version of the function
```python
def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
    # Handle RGBA images separately to preserve transparency
    if image.mode == 'RGBA':
        background = Image.new('RGBA', image.size, (255, 255, 255, 255))  # Create a white background with alpha
        background.paste(image, mask=image.split()[3])  # Use the alpha channel as a mask
        image = background.convert('RGB')
    else:
        image = image.convert('RGB')

    if size:
        image = image.copy()
        image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)

    buf = BytesIO()
    image.save(buf, 'JPEG')
    return image, buf
```

By correctly handling images with RGBA mode, the revised function ensures that transparency is maintained during the conversion process. This fix should allow the function to pass the failing test case and provide the expected output values in all test scenarios.
