### Analysis
The buggy function `convert_image` is designed to handle converting images with different formats and modes, resizing them if needed, and saving them as JPEG format. There are multiple issues in the function that need to be addressed in order to pass the failing test.

1. The function incorrectly handles the conversion of PNG images with the RGBA mode. It should paste the image onto a new RGBA background before converting it to RGB.
2. The function does not handle the case when the image mode is 'P' properly. It needs to convert the 'P' mode image to RGBA before proceeding with the conversion to RGB.
3. The function does not correctly resize images to the desired size when specified.

### Bug
The bug occurs when attempting to convert a PNG image with RGBA mode. The function fails to handle transparency properly, resulting in incorrect color values in the converted image.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to add a condition to handle PNG images with RGBA mode correctly. This involves pasting the image onto a new RGBA background before converting it to RGB. Additionally, we need to convert 'P' mode images to RGBA before proceeding with the conversion to RGB. Ensure that the resizing of images is done correctly when a size parameter is provided.

### The corrected version of the function
```python
def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
    if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA':
        background = Image.new('RGBA', image.size, (255, 255, 255))
        background.paste(image, (0, 0), image)
        image = background.convert('RGB')
    elif image.mode == 'P':
        image = image.convert('RGBA')

    if size:
        image = image.copy()
        image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)

    buf = BytesIO()
    image.save(buf, 'JPEG')
    return image, buf
```

By making these modifications, the function should now correctly handle PNG images with RGBA mode, convert 'P' mode images to RGBA, and resize images to the desired size when specified. This should address the issues identified in the failing test cases and produce the expected outputs.
