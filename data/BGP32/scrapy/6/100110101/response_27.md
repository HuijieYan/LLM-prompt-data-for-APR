### Analysis
The buggy function `convert_image` is designed to convert an input image to a specific format (RGB) and size, if specified. The bug in the function seems to be related to handling images with transparency (RGBA) and converting them to RGB format. In particular, the bug manifests when dealing with PNG images that have transparency.

The failing test case `test_convert_image` checks the color information of the converted images and expects specific values based on the input image formats and modes.

### Identified Issue
The issue arises when handling PNG images with RGBA mode and transparency. The buggy function fails to handle transparency correctly, resulting in incorrect color information in the converted image.

### Bug Cause
1. When the input image is in PNG format and RGBA mode, the buggy function creates a new RGBA image with a white background and then converts it to RGB. However, the paste operation does not handle transparency as expected, leading to incorrect color data.
2. The buggy function overwrites the original image variable with the converted image, losing the initial transparency information.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug
1. Properly handle transparency in the conversion process for PNG images with RGBA mode.
2. Ensure that the original image's transparency information is preserved during the conversion.

### Corrected Function
```python
def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
    if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA':
        background = Image.new('RGBA', image.size, (255, 255, 255, 255))  # Ensure alpha channel for the background
        background.paste(image, (0, 0), image)
        image = background.convert('RGB')
    elif image.mode != 'RGB':
        image = image.convert('RGB')

    if size:
        image_copy = image.copy()
        image_copy.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)
        image = image_copy

    buf = BytesIO()
    image.save(buf, 'JPEG')
    return image, buf
```

By handling transparency correctly during the conversion process and preserving the original image data, the corrected function should pass the failing test cases and satisfy the expected input/output values.
