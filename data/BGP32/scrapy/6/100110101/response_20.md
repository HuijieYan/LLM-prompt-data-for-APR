### Analysis
The buggy function `convert_image` has a conditional statement to handle different image formats and modes. There are two specific cases where the bug occurs:
1. When the input image format is `'PNG'` and mode is `'RGBA'`, the function intends to create a new RGBA image to handle transparency but mistakenly pastes the original image onto a white background, leading to unexpected color changes.
2. When the input image is not in mode `'RGB'`, the function aims to convert it to RGB format, but it fails to do so correctly.

### Bug Cause
The bug causes the image to lose its original transparency when it has a PNG format and RGBA mode. This results in incorrect pixel color values, as seen in the failed test output. The error message indicates a mismatch between the expected and actual color values in the converted image.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug
To fix the bug, we need to adjust the conditional handling for PNG format and RGBA mode. Instead of pasting the original image on a white background, we should directly convert the image to RGB format while preserving its transparency. Additionally, we need to ensure that the conversion to RGB format happens correctly for images in other modes.

### Corrected Version of the Function
```python
def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
    if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA':
        converted = image.convert('RGB')
    elif image.mode != 'RGB':
        converted = image.convert('RGB')
    else:
        converted = image

    if size:
        converted = converted.copy()
        converted.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)

    buf = BytesIO()
    converted.save(buf, 'JPEG')
    return converted, buf
``` 

By directly converting the RGBA image to RGB format without including a white background, the corrected function should preserve the original image's transparency and handle other image modes appropriately. This revised logic should address the bug and enable the function to pass the failing test cases.
