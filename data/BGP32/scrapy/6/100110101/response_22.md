### Analysis:
The buggy function `convert_image` has several issues:
1. In the case where the image format is 'PNG' and mode is 'RGBA', the code pastes the image onto a new background without properly handling transparency, leading to incorrect colors.
2. The function does not handle transparency correctly when converting RGBA images to RGB.
3. The function does not handle the case when the input image mode is 'P' (Palette), causing incorrect color processing.

### Bug Explanation:
The failing test specifically highlights an issue with transparency when converting RGBA images to RGB. The failing assertion indicates that after conversion, the colors do not match the expected values. This is due to incorrect handling of transparency in the function, resulting in unexpected color changes.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bugs in the `convert_image` function:
1. Properly handle transparency when pasting the RGBA image onto a new background.
2. Ensure that transparency is correctly handled when converting RGBA images to RGB.
3. Address the handling of images with mode 'P' (Palette) to prevent color issues.

### Corrected Version of `convert_image` function:

```python
def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
    if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA':
        # Create a new RGBA image with a white background
        background = Image.new('RGBA', image.size, (255, 255, 255, 255))
        # Composite the image onto the background
        image = Image.alpha_composite(background, image).convert('RGB')
    elif image.mode != 'RGB' and image.mode != 'P':
        # Convert any non-RGB or non-Palette image to RGB
        image = image.convert('RGB')

    if size:
        image = image.copy()
        # Resize the image while maintaining aspect ratio
        image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)

    buf = BytesIO()
    image.save(buf, 'JPEG')
    return image, buf
```

The corrected version of the `convert_image` function includes proper handling of transparency and image conversion to RGB. It also addresses the mode 'P' (Palette) case to ensure correct color processing. This corrected version should now pass the failing test cases and meet the expected input/output values.
