### Analysis
The buggy function is attempting to convert images to RGB format and resize them while maintaining image ratio. However, the bug is causing incorrect color transformations and incorrect image resizing, leading to failing test cases.

### Error Location
The bug is primarily located in the `convert_image` function where the color conversion and resizing operations are taking place.

### Cause of the Bug
1. For PNG images with RGBA mode, the conversion to RGB is done incorrectly by creating a new background image and pasting the original image on it. This process causes color distortions.
2. The resizing operation for maintaining image ratio is not correctly implemented, leading to incorrect image dimensions.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug
1. Fix the RGBA to RGB conversion by properly converting the image without a background image.
2. Correct the resizing operation to maintain image ratio while resizing.

### Corrected Version of the Function
```python
def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
    original_mode = image.mode

    if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA':
        # Convert RGBA to RGB without color distortions
        image = image.convert("RGB")
    elif image.mode != 'RGB':
        image = image.convert('RGB')

    if size:
        # Resize the image while maintaining aspect ratio
        image.thumbnail(size)

    buf = BytesIO()
    image.save(buf, 'JPEG')

    return image, buf
```

By correctly converting RGBA images to RGB and implementing image resizing with aspect ratio preservation, the corrected function should now pass the failing test cases.
