### Bug Analysis
The buggy function `convert_image` has a bug related to image conversion. The bug occurs when the input image is in PNG format with RGBA mode. In this case, the function creates a new RGBA image filled with white color and then attempts to convert it to RGB format. However, the bug is in the `paste` method usage where it should be pasting `image` instead of `background` into `background` itself. This results in the background image being pasted on top of itself, leading to incorrect conversion.

### Bug Location
The bug is located in the following section of the code:
```python
background.paste(image, image)
```

### Bug Explanation
When the function tries to paste `image` into `background` by using `background.paste(image, image)`, the second `image` argument refers to the 'mask' parameter, which should specify the transparency mask. However, using `image` for both `image` and `mask` results in incorrect pasting and conversion behavior. This is the root cause of the bug.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, the correct usage of the `paste` method should be applied. We need to ensure that the image is pasted correctly onto the background. By replacing `background.paste(image, image)` with `background.paste(image, mask=image.split()[3])`, we ensure that the transparency mask is correctly utilized for RGBA images during pasting.

### Corrected Function
Now, I will provide the corrected version of the function `convert_image`:

```python
def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
    if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA':
        background = Image.new('RGBA', image.size, (255, 255, 255))
        background.paste(image, mask=image.split()[3])  # Fix the paste method usage
        image = background.convert('RGB')
    elif image.mode != 'RGB':
        image = image.convert('RGB')

    if size:
        image = image.copy()
        image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)

    buf = BytesIO()
    image.save(buf, 'JPEG')
    return image, buf
```

By making this change, the bug related to image conversion for PNG images with RGBA mode should be fixed, and the function should now pass the failing test cases.
