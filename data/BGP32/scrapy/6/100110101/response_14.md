### Correction:

```python
def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
    if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA':
        background = Image.new('RGBA', image.size, (255, 255, 255))
        background.paste(image, (0, 0), image)
        image = background.convert('RGB')
    elif image.mode != 'RGB':
        image = image.convert('RGB')

    if size:
        image = image.copy()
        image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)

    buf = BytesIO()
    image.save(buf, 'JPEG')
    return image, buf
``` 

### Explanation:
The bug in the original code lies in the line:
```python
background.paste(image, image)
```
The correct way to paste an image onto another in PIL's `paste` function is to provide a `(x, y)` location as the second argument. In this case, `(0, 0)` should be provided as the location where the image should be pasted.

Additionally, when converting an RGBA image to RGB, it's crucial to handle the transparency channel properly. The corrected code ensures that the transparency is preserved during the conversion.

By making these changes, the function should now pass the failing test cases while maintaining the expected input/output values.
