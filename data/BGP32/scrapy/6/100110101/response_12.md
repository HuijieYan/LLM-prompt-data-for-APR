### Analysis:
The buggy function `convert_image` has an issue where it incorrectly converts images with PNG format and RGBA mode to JPEG format. This conversion leads to a loss of transparency information in the image, resulting in failing tests where the expected output includes information on transparency.

The bug originates from the conditional statement where it converts PNG images with RGBA mode to RGB format without considering the alpha channel information. This leads to the loss of transparency and subsequently, the failing tests.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is caused by the incorrect way transparent images are handled. The function should consider the alpha channel when converting RGBA images to RGB to preserve the transparency information. The current implementation simply converts RGBA to RGB without accounting for the alpha channel, causing the transparency information to be lost.

### Fix Strategy:
1. Check if the input image is in PNG format with RGBA mode.
2. If the above condition is met, create a new RGBA image background with a white fill that matches the size of the input image.
3. Paste the input image onto the white background to retain the transparency.
4. Convert the pasted image to RGB format while maintaining transparency.
5. Resize the image if a specific size is provided.
6. Save and return the converted image along with the buffer.

### Corrected Version:
```python
from PIL import Image
from io import BytesIO

def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
    if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA':
        background = Image.new('RGBA', image.size, (255, 255, 255, 255))
        background.paste(image, (0, 0), image)
        image = background.convert('RGBA')
    elif image.mode != 'RGB':
        image = image.convert('RGB')

    if size:
        image = image.copy()
        image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)

    buf = BytesIO()
    image.save(buf, 'JPEG')
    return image, buf
```

By making the modifications as suggested above, the corrected `convert_image` function should now handle PNG images with RGBA mode correctly and preserve transparency information during the conversion, ensuring that the failing tests pass with the expected results.
