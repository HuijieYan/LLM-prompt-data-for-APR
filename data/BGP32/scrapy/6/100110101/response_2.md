### Bug Explanation
The bug in the `convert_image` function occurs due to improper handling of images in RGBA format when attempting to convert them. The function incorrectly assumes all RGBA images need a white background before converting to RGB format.

1. In the first conditional block, when the image is in RGBA format and format is PNG, the function creates a white background and pastes the original image on it. Then it converts the merged image to RGB format, assuming all RGBA images need this treatment. This assumption is incorrect, as not all RGBA images necessarily need a white background to become RGB.
   
2. As a result, when an image with transparency is converted in RGBA to RGB using this process, the transparency information is lost, leading to incorrect output for the failing test cases that involve RGBA images with transparency.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix this bug, we need to modify the function logic to handle RGBA images with transparency correctly. One approach is to check whether the image contains transparency information before deciding to apply a white background. If transparency is present, we should handle it appropriately to preserve the transparency in the RGB image.

### Corrected Function
```python
def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
    if image.mode == 'RGBA':
        if image.getchannel('A').getbbox():
            background = Image.new('RGBA', image.size, (255, 255, 255, 255))
            background.paste(image, image)
            image = background.convert('RGB')
    elif image.mode != 'RGB':
        image = image.convert('RGB')

    if size:
        image = image.copy()
        image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)

    buf = BytesIO()
    image.save(buf, 'JPEG')
    return image, buf
```

By checking if the image contains transparency using `image.getchannel('A').getbbox()`, we can accurately determine whether to include a white background for RGBA images. This correction ensures that the function properly handles the conversion of RGBA images with and without transparency, fixing the bug and allowing the failing test cases to pass.
