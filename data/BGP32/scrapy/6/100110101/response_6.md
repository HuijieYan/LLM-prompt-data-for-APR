### Bug Explanation:
The bug in the `convert_image` function arises when the input image is in PNG format with RGBA mode. The function tries to convert the image to RGB mode by pasting it onto a new RGBA image filled with white. However, when pasting the original image onto the white background, the `image` parameter is erroneously passed twice to the `paste()` method, causing unexpected results and an error in the subsequent assertions.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug in the `convert_image` function, we need to correct the way the original image is pasted onto the white background to ensure that the correct behavior is achieved. We should only pass the original image once to the `paste()` method. Additionally, we need to handle the case where the input image is PNG with RGBA mode more effectively.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
    if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA':
        background = Image.new('RGBA', image.size, (255, 255, 255))
        background.paste(image, (0, 0), image)
        image = background.convert('RGB')
    elif image.mode != 'RGB':
        image = image.convert('RGB')
        
    if size:
        image = image.copy()
        image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)
        
    buf = BytesIO()
    image.save(buf, 'JPEG')
    return image, buf
```

In the corrected version, the `paste()` method is called with the original image only once, using the additional parameters for position and mask. This ensures correct pasting behavior. Additionally, the function now correctly handles PNG images with RGBA mode, converting them to RGB mode with the intended white background overlay.
