### Analysis
The buggy function `convert_image` is expected to convert the input image to RGB mode and compress it to a JPEG format. The function has conditional branches based on the image format and mode. However, there are issues in the logic of handling RGBA mode images.

### Issues
1. When the image format is PNG and mode is RGBA, the function incorrectly creates a new image (`background`) with RGBA mode and pastes the original image on it. This results in a background image that has an undesired transparency effect, affecting the final conversion to RGB. 
2. In the RGBA to RGB conversion, the function should handle the transparency correctly by blending the image with a white background.

### Bug Cause
The bug arises due to not handling transparency correctly in the conversion of RGBA images to RGB. The `background.paste(image, image)` operation pastes the original image on a transparent background, affecting the RGB conversion outcome.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug
1. When the input image is PNG and mode is RGBA, create a white background image and paste the original image on this background before converting to RGB.
2. Ensure that transparency in RGBA images is handled correctly, so the final conversion to RGB does not produce unexpected results.

### Fixed Version of the Function
```python
def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
    if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA':
        background = Image.new('RGB', image.size, (255, 255, 255))
        background.paste(image, mask=image.split()[3])  # Apply alpha channel as a mask
        image = background
    elif image.mode != 'RGB':
        image = image.convert('RGB')

    if size:
        image = image.copy()
        image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)

    buf = BytesIO()
    image.save(buf, 'JPEG')
    return image, buf
```

By pasting the RGBA image onto a white background with an alpha channel mask, the corrected function ensures that transparency is handled correctly when converting RGBA images to RGB. This should resolve the bug and make the function pass the failing test cases.
