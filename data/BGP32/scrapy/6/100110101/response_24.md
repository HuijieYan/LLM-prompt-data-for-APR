### Bug Explanation
The bug in the `convert_image` function arises from the incorrect handling of images with RGBA mode and PNG format. The function wrongly assumes that images with RGBA mode and PNG format should always be converted to RGB format. This assumption leads to incorrect results which cause the test to fail.

In the failing test case, the input image has RGBA mode and PNG format with a certain color value. After the conversion, the expected result should retain the color values and only change the format if necessary. However, the function incorrectly converts the image to RGB mode, resulting in different color values, which causes the test to fail.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we should modify the logic of the `convert_image` function to handle images with RGBA mode and PNG format appropriately. Images with RGBA mode and PNG format should not always be converted to RGB mode. Instead, they should be converted to the desired format without altering the color values.

### Corrected Function
```python
def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
    if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA':
        new_image = Image.new('RGBA', image.size, (255, 255, 255))
        new_image.paste(image, (0, 0), mask=image.split()[3])
        image = new_image
    elif image.mode != 'RGB':
        image = image.convert('RGB')
        
    if size:
        image = image.copy()
        image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)
        
    buf = BytesIO()
    image.save(buf, 'JPEG')
    
    return image, buf
```

After applying this fix, the `convert_image` function should now handle images with RGBA mode and PNG format correctly, ensuring that the color values are preserved during the conversion. This corrected version of the function should pass all test cases and satisfy the expected input/output values.
