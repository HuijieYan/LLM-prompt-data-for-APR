### Bug Analysis:
The bug in the `convert_image` function lies in the conditional statements that handle image conversion. Specifically, when dealing with PNG images in RGBA mode, the function incorrectly converts the image to RGB by pasting the image on a white background. This approach does not preserve the transparency of the original image, resulting in an incorrect conversion.

### Bug Explanation:
In the failing test case, the function is provided with an RGBA PNG image with a semi-transparent color. After the buggy function processes the image, it converts it to RGB by pasting it onto a white background. This results in the transparent pixels of the image blending with the white background, altering the colors and appearance of the image.

The failing test compares the colors of the resulting image with the expected colors, leading to a mismatch due to the incorrect conversion approach used in the buggy function. The expected colors reflect the original RGBA image's colors while the converted image includes the white background interference.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to modify the conditional block responsible for handling RGBA PNG images. Instead of pasting the image onto a white background, we should convert the image from RGBA directly to RGB mode, preserving the original colors and transparency.

### The corrected version of the function:
```python
def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
    if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA':
        image = image.convert('RGB')

    elif image.mode != 'RGB':
        image = image.convert('RGB')

    if size:
        image = image.copy()
        image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)

    buf = BytesIO()
    image.save(buf, 'JPEG')
    return image, buf
``` 

By using the `convert('RGB')` method on the RGBA image directly, we ensure that the transparency and colors are maintained during the conversion, fixing the bug identified in the failing test case.
