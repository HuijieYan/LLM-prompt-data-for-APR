### Bug Analysis
The bug in the `convert_image` function is causing issues in handling images with RGBA mode and PNG format. When the function encounters an image with format PNG and mode RGBA, it attempts to create a new RGBA background image and paste the original image onto it. However, the `paste` method does not work as expected, leading to incorrect results.

### Bug Location
The bug is located in the block that handles PNG images with RGBA mode:
```python
background.paste(image, image)
```
The `paste` method does not accept the original image `image` as the second argument. This results in a failure to correctly paste the original image onto the background.

### Bug Cause
The bug is caused by passing the original image as the second argument to the `paste` method, which is incorrect. Instead of pasting the original image onto the background, the method pastes the image onto itself, resulting in the incorrect behavior observed in the failing test.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to correctly paste the original image onto the background image when dealing with PNG images in RGBA mode. We can create a new RGBA background image, paste the original image onto it, and then convert it to RGB as intended.

### Corrected Function
```python
def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
    if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA':
        background = Image.new('RGBA', image.size, (255, 255, 255, 255))
        background.paste(image, (0, 0), image)
        image = background.convert('RGB')
    elif image.mode != 'RGB':
        image = image.convert('RGB')

    if size:
        image = image.copy()
        image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)

    buf = BytesIO()
    image.save(buf, 'JPEG')
    return image, buf
```

After making the above change to the `convert_image` function, it should now correctly handle images with PNG format and RGBA mode, pasting the original image onto a white background and converting it to RGB. This corrected version should pass the failing test cases and satisfy the expected input/output values.
