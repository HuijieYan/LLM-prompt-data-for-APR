### Bug Analysis:
The bug in the `convert_image` function seems to be related to the handling of images with RGBA format in PNG images. The function tries to convert RGBA images to RGB by creating a new RGBA background and then converting it to RGB. However, in the process, there seems to be an issue with the transparency channel.

### Bug Cause:
The bug arises when converting an image from RGBA to RGB by using a white background. In this process, the transparency information gets lost, resulting in a wrong color due to the blending with the white background.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to preserve the transparency information when converting from RGBA to RGB. One solution is to use the `convert` method of the `Image` class with the `without_alpha` parameter set to `True`.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
    if image.mode == 'RGBA':
        image = image.convert('RGB', palette=Image.ADAPTIVE, colors=255)  # Convert to RGB preserving transparency

    if size:
        image_thumbnail = image.copy()
        image_thumbnail.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)
        buf = BytesIO()
        image_thumbnail.save(buf, 'JPEG')
        return image_thumbnail, buf

    buf = BytesIO()
    image.save(buf, 'JPEG')
    return image, buf
```

By making these changes, the function should now preserve the transparency when converting RGBA images to RGB, thus fixing the bug encountered in the failing test.
