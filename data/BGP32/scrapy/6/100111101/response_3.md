### Bug Explanation
The bug in the `convert_image` function arises from the incorrect handling of images with transparency. Specifically, the function is not correctly converting images with an RGBA mode and PNG format. When dealing with RGBA images, it creates a new background image and pastes the original image onto it before converting it to RGB. However, the pasting operation is incorrect, leading to unexpected results.

### Bug Location
The bug is primarily located in the conditional block where the image format is PNG and the mode is RGBA. The incorrect pasting operation on the background image causes the resulting images to have unexpected colors.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix this bug, we need to correctly paste the RGBA image onto the background image before converting it to RGB. We should ensure that transparency is handled properly during the conversion process.

### Corrected Function
Here is the corrected version of the `convert_image` function:

```python
def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
    if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA':
        background = Image.new('RGBA', image.size, (255, 255, 255, 255))
        background.paste(image, (0, 0), image)
        image = background.convert('RGB')
    elif image.mode != 'RGB':
        image = image.convert('RGB')

    if size:
        image = image.copy()
        image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)

    buf = BytesIO()
    image.save(buf, 'JPEG')
    return image, buf
```

This corrected version ensures that transparency is handled correctly when converting RGBA images with a PNG format. It pastes the RGBA image onto a white background before converting it to RGB. This fix should address the failing test cases and provide the expected output values.
