### Bug Explanation
The bug in the `convert_image` function lies in the condition that checks for image format being 'PNG' and mode being 'RGBA'. When this condition is met, the function creates a new background image of mode 'RGBA' filled with white and pastes the original image onto it. However, when pasting the image onto the background, the `paste` method expects two arguments: the upper left corner to start pasting and the lower right corner to end pasting. In this case, `image` is being passed twice to the `paste` method, causing the bug.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix this bug, we need to correct the way the image is pasted onto the background, ensuring that the upper left corner is (0,0) and the full image dimensions are covered during pasting.

### Corrected Function
```python
# The corrected convert_image function
def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
    if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA':
        background = Image.new('RGBA', image.size, (255, 255, 255))
        background.paste(image, (0, 0, image.size[0], image.size[1]))
        image = background.convert('RGB')
    elif image.mode != 'RGB':
        image = image.convert('RGB')

    if size:
        image = image.copy()
        image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)

    buf = BytesIO()
    image.save(buf, 'JPEG')
    return image, buf
```

By making this correction, the function will correctly paste the image onto the background. The function should now pass the failing test cases provided.
