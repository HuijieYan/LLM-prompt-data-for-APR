### Bug Explanation
The bug in the `convert_image` function arises when handling PNG images with RGBA mode. When the input image has the format 'PNG' and mode 'RGBA', the function incorrectly converts it to RGB by creating a new RGBA background image filled with white color and then pasting the original image on top of it. However, the `paste` method requires a rectangular region to paste the image, and passing the entire image as a parameter leads to incorrect results.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix this bug, we need to modify how the RGBA image is converted to RGB. Instead of directly pasting the RGBA image on a white background, we should convert the image while preserving its transparency. This can be achieved by converting the image directly to RGB without any intermediate steps.

### Corrected Version of the Function
```python
def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
    if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA':
        image = image.convert('RGB')
    elif image.mode != 'RGB':
        image = image.convert('RGB')

    if size:
        image = image.copy()
        image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)

    buf = BytesIO()
    image.save(buf, 'JPEG')
    return image, buf
```

By directly converting the RGBA image to RGB without pasting it on a white background, the corrected function should now handle PNG images with RGBA mode correctly, passing the failing test cases and ensuring the expected input/output values.
