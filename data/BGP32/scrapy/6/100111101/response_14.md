### Bug Explanation
The bug in the `convert_image` function arises from the way the transparency handling is done for PNG images with RGBA mode. When a PNG image with RGBA mode is encountered, the code attempts to create a new RGBA background with the desired size and color, then pastes the original image onto this background before converting it to RGB mode. However, the `paste` function is being called incorrectly with the same `image` argument twice, resulting in the original image being pasted onto itself. This causes issues with transparency handling and leads to incorrect pixel values after conversion to RGB.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to correct the paste operation by replacing `background.paste(image, image)` with `background.paste(image, (0, 0, image.size[0], image.size[1]), image)`. This change ensures that the original image is pasted onto the created background correctly, preserving any transparency information during the conversion process.

### Corrected Function
Here is the corrected version of the `convert_image` function:

```python
def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
    if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA':
        background = Image.new('RGBA', image.size, (255, 255, 255))
        background.paste(image, (0, 0, image.size[0], image.size[1]), image)
        image = background.convert('RGB')
    elif image.mode != 'RGB':
        image = image.convert('RGB')

    if size:
        image = image.copy()
        image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)

    buf = BytesIO()
    image.save(buf, 'JPEG')
    return image, buf
``` 

By making this correction in the `paste` operation, the function should now handle transparency in PNG images with RGBA mode correctly and pass the failing test cases.
