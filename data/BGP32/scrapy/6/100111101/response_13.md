### Bug Analysis:
The bug in the `convert_image` function lies in the handling of images with an RGBA format. When the input image is in PNG format and has RGBA mode, the function incorrectly converts it to RGB by creating a new image with a white background and pasting the original image on top. This approach leads to a loss of transparency information and alters the colors in the resulting image, causing the failing tests.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to handle images with RGBA format differently to preserve transparency. Instead of creating a new RGB image with a white background, we should convert the RGBA image to RGB format while maintaining the transparency information.

### Corrected Function:
```python
# The corrected version of the function
def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
    if image.mode == 'RGBA':
        image = image.convert('RGBA')
    else:
        image = image.convert('RGB')

    if size:
        image = image.copy()
        image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)

    buf = BytesIO()
    image.save(buf, 'JPEG')
    return image, buf
```

By modifying the conditional block that handles RGBA images in the function, we ensure that the transparency information is preserved when converting the image. This corrected version should now pass the failing tests and satisfy the expected input/output values.
