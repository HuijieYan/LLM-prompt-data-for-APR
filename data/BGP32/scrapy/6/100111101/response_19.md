### Bug Explanation
The bug in the `convert_image` function arises when processing images with transparency (RGBA mode for PNG images). The function fails to correctly handle images with transparency, resulting in incorrect color values after conversion.

In the failing test case, the function is expected to convert an image with RGBA mode to RGB mode and maintain the color values correctly. However, the function is not correctly handling the conversion of RGBA images to RGB, leading to incorrect color values.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the function correctly handles images with transparency (RGBA mode) during the conversion process. Specifically, when dealing with PNG images in RGBA mode, we need to address the transparency channel to maintain correct color values in the converted image.

### Corrected Function
Here is the corrected version of the `convert_image` function that addresses the bug:

```python
def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
    if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA':
        background = Image.new('RGB', image.size, (255, 255, 255))
        background.paste(image, (0, 0), image)
        image = background
    elif image.mode != 'RGB':
        image = image.convert('RGB')

    if size:
        image = image.copy()
        image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)

    buf = BytesIO()
    image.save(buf, 'JPEG')
    return image, buf
```

By making the adjustments as outlined above, the function now correctly handles PNG images in the RGBA mode during the conversion process. This corrected version should now pass the failing test cases and maintain the correct color values after conversion.
