### Bug Explanation
The bug in the `convert_image` function lies in the conditional statement where it tries to handle PNG images with RGBA mode differently. When the image format is PNG and the mode is RGBA, the function creates a new image `background` of RGBA mode and pastes the original image onto it. Subsequently, it converts this `background` image to RGB mode.

The issue arises when trying to paste the original image onto the background. The correct operation should be `background.paste(image, (0, 0))` instead of `background.paste(image, image)`. The incorrect usage of `image` as the second argument causes the original image to be pasted over itself incorrectly, leading to incorrect results in the converted image.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to update the buggy line of code that pastes the original image onto the background. By correctly pasting the image on the background, we should be able to resolve the issue and ensure that the function behaves as expected for PNG images with RGBA mode.

### Corrected Version of the Function
```python
def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
    if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA':
        background = Image.new('RGBA', image.size, (255, 255, 255))
        # Correct the pasting of the original image
        background.paste(image, (0, 0))
        image = background.convert('RGB')
    elif image.mode != 'RGB':
        image = image.convert('RGB')

    if size:
        image = image.copy()
        image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)

    buf = BytesIO()
    image.save(buf, 'JPEG')
    return image, buf
```

By using the corrected version of the `convert_image` function, the issues with handling PNG images in RGBA mode should be resolved, and the function should now pass the failing test cases.
