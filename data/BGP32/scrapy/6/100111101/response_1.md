### Analyzing the buggy function and failing tests

#### Bug in the function:
1. The function has a conditional check for PNG format and RGBA mode images to convert them to RGB. However, in the first branch of the condition, when creating a new image with a white background and preserving alpha channel, the `paste()` function is incorrectly used. The correct method is to use `background.paste(image, (0, 0), image)` to paste the image with the alpha channel.
2. In the case where the image mode is not RGB, the function converts the image to RGB. However, this conversion shouldn't be done if the image format is PNG and mode is P.

#### Bug in the failing test:
The failing test `test_convert_image` compares the colors of converted images which do not match the expected values.

### Fixing the bug

#### Strategy for fixing the bug:
1. Correctly paste the image onto the white background preserving the alpha channel for PNG RGBA images.
2. Skip converting to RGB when the image mode is not RGB and the format is PNG with mode P.
3. Ensure that the converted images in the failing tests have the correct colors matching the expected values.

#### Corrected version of the function:

```python
def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
    if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA':
        background = Image.new('RGBA', image.size, (255, 255, 255, 255))
        background.paste(image, (0, 0), image)
        image = background.convert('RGB')
    elif image.format != 'JPEG' or image.mode != 'RGB':
        image = image.convert('RGB')

    if size:
        image = image.copy()
        image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)

    buf = BytesIO()
    image.save(buf, 'JPEG')
    return image, buf
```

Now, with these corrections, the function should correctly handle different image types and formations as expected.

### The corrected function should now pass the failing test.
