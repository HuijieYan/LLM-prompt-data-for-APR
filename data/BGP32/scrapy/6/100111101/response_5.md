### Bug Explanation
The bug in the `convert_image` function arises from the incorrect handling of images with RGBA format and PNG format. When the function encounters an image with PNG format and RGBA mode, it tries to convert it to RGB by creating a new image with a white background and pasting the original image onto it. However, the `paste` method is called incorrectly, resulting in an image with unchanged content.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, the correct way to paste the original image onto the white background image is by using the `paste` method with the correct arguments. Additionally, the condition checking for PNG format and RGBA mode should be adjusted to properly convert the image.

### Corrected Version of the Function
```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: scrapy/pipelines/images.py

# this is the corrected function
def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
    if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA':
        background = Image.new('RGBA', image.size, (255, 255, 255, 255))
        background.paste(image, (0, 0), image)
        image = background.convert('RGB')
    elif image.mode != 'RGB':
        image = image.convert('RGB')

    if size:
        image = image.copy()
        image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)

    buf = BytesIO()
    image.save(buf, 'JPEG')
    return image, buf
```

By using the corrected function above, the `convert_image` function now properly handles PNG images with RGBA mode, creating the correct background and pasting the original image onto it before converting it to RGB. This should fix the failing test cases reported earlier.
