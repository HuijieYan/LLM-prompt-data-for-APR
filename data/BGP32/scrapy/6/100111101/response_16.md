### Explanation:
The bug is in the condition where the function checks if the image format is PNG and the mode is RGBA. In this case, it creates a new background image filled with white color and then pastes the original image on top of it. However, the issue lies in the `paste` function call, where it should pass a tuple for the box argument but mistakenly passed the image itself.

### Bug:
In the buggy function:
```python
background.paste(image, image)
```
The second argument should be a tuple specifying the position where the image should be pasted, not the image itself.

### Fix:
Update the buggy line in the code to provide the correct box argument when pasting the image on the background.

### Corrected Function:
```python
def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
    if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA':
        background = Image.new('RGBA', image.size, (255, 255, 255))
        background.paste(image, (0, 0))  # Corrected line
        image = background.convert('RGB')
    elif image.mode != 'RGB':
        image = image.convert('RGB')

    if size:
        image = image.copy()
        image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)

    buf = BytesIO()
    image.save(buf, 'JPEG')
    return image, buf
``` 

By correcting the line that pastes the image onto the background, the function should now work correctly and pass the failing test cases.
