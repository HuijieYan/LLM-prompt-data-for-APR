### Bug Explanation
The bug lies in the conditional statement that checks for the image format and mode. Specifically, the bug occurs when the image format is 'PNG' and the mode is 'RGBA'. In this case, the function creates a new RGBA background and pastes the original image on top of it. However, the `paste` method is being used incorrectly, resulting in incorrect image conversion.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix this bug, we need to modify the way the original image is pasted onto the background. Instead of passing the image to the `paste` method twice, we should pass the image and the coordinates `(0, 0)` indicating the top-left corner where the image should be pasted.

### The corrected version of the function
```python
# The corrected version of the function 
def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
    if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA':
        background = Image.new('RGBA', image.size, (255, 255, 255))
        background.paste(image, (0, 0))
        image = background.convert('RGB')
    elif image.mode != 'RGB':
        image = image.convert('RGB')

    if size:
        image = image.copy()
        image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)

    buf = BytesIO()
    image.save(buf, 'JPEG')
    return image, buf
```

By modifying the `background.paste(image, (0, 0))` line, we ensure that the image is correctly pasted onto the background image. This correction should address the issues identified in the failing test cases and provide the expected output values.
