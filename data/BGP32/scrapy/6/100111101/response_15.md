### Bug Explanation
The bug occurs in the `convert_image` function during the image conversion process. Specifically, the bug fails to correctly handle images with RGBA mode and PNG format. When the input image has format 'PNG' and mode 'RGBA', the function incorrectly converts it to RGB by pasting the image onto a white background, resulting in a loss of transparency data. This leads to incorrect color values during the comparison in the failing test case.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, the function needs to differentiate between image conversions for PNG RGBA images and other image formats. For PNG RGBA images, the transparency data should be preserved when converting to RGB. To achieve this, we can modify the logic inside the first conditional block to handle PNG RGBA images appropriately by using a transparent background instead of a white background.

### Corrected Function
Here is the corrected version of the `convert_image` function:

```python
def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
    if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA':
        # Preserve transparency for PNG RGBA images
        background = Image.new('RGBA', image.size, (0, 0, 0, 0))
        background.paste(image, (0, 0), image)
        image = background.convert('RGB')
    elif image.mode != 'RGB':
        image = image.convert('RGB')

    if size:
        image = image.copy()
        image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)

    buf = BytesIO()
    image.save(buf, 'JPEG')
    return image, buf
```

With this corrected function, the transparency of PNG RGBA images will be preserved during the conversion to RGB, resolving the bug.
