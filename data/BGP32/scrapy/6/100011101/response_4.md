## Buggy Function Analysis
The buggy function is designed to handle image conversions and resize images if a size parameter is provided. However, there are issues in the logic of the function that lead to failing tests.

1. In the first conditional block, the function checks if the image format is PNG and the mode is RGBA. If these conditions are met, it creates a new RGB image with a white background and then pastes the original image onto it. This conversion logic is faulty as it should preserve the original transparency of the RGBA image. Moreover, the paste operation is incorrect.
   
2. The second conditional block converts the image to RGB if the mode is not already RGB. This conversion is valid.
   
3. If a size parameter is provided, the function generates a thumbnail of the image with the specified size using anti-aliasing.
   
4. Lastly, the function saves the image in JPEG format and returns the image and the BytesIO buffer.

## Bug Explanation
The failing tests are due to incorrect image conversions, especially when dealing with RGBA images. The function is not handling transparency correctly during the conversion, leading to color discrepancies in image comparisons.

1. The transparency from the original RGBA image is lost in the conversion, leading to color differences in the output image.
   
2. The buggy paste operation is pasting the entire image, including the transparent areas, onto the white background, resulting in an incorrect composition.

## Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to adjust the image conversion logic to handle RGBA images correctly. We should preserve transparency during the conversion process and ensure that the background paste operation maintains the alpha channel.

## Corrected Function
```python
def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
    if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA':
        # Create a new RGBA image with white background
        background = Image.new('RGBA', image.size, (255, 255, 255, 255))

        # Composite the original image onto the background preserving transparency
        image = Image.alpha_composite(background, image)

        # Convert the composite image to RGB, preserving transparency
        image = image.convert('RGB')
    elif image.mode != 'RGB':
        # Convert any non-RGB image to RGB
        image = image.convert('RGB')

    if size:
        # If size parameter provided, generate a thumbnail with anti-aliasing
        image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)

    buf = BytesIO()
    image.save(buf, 'JPEG')
    return image, buf
```

By using `Image.alpha_composite` to overlay the original RGBA image on the white background, we can preserve transparency during the conversion. This revised logic ensures that the RGBA images maintain their transparency channel when converted to RGB.
