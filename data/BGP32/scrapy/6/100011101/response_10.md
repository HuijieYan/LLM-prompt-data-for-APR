### Bug Explanation
The buggy function has a conditional check that if the image format is 'PNG' and the mode is 'RGBA', it creates a new RGBA background image, pastes the original image onto it, and then converts it to RGB. However, the conversion from RGBA to RGB results in a loss of transparency information since the new background is filled with white.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that transparency information is preserved when converting from RGBA to RGB. This can be achieved by creating a new RGBA image as the background, pasting the original image onto it, and then converting the result to RGB.

### Corrected Code
```python
def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
    if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA':
        background = Image.new('RGBA', image.size, (0, 0, 0, 0))  # Create transparent background
        background.paste(image, image)
        image = background.convert('RGB')
    elif image.mode != 'RGB':
        image = image.convert('RGB')

    if size:
        image = image.copy()
        image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)

    buf = BytesIO()
    image.save(buf, 'JPEG')
    return image, buf
```

This corrected version of the function ensures that transparency information is preserved when converting images from RGBA to RGB. Now the function should pass the failing tests and preserve transparency properly.
