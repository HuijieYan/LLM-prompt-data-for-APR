### Bug Explanation
The bug in the `convert_image` function occurs due to how the function handles images with transparent backgrounds (mode='RGBA' and format='PNG'). When the image format is PNG and the mode is RGBA, the function attempts to paste the image onto a new RGBA background with white color. However, the `paste` method does not correctly handle transparency, resulting in incorrect color values when converting the image to RGB.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that transparency is correctly handled when pasting the image onto a new background. One way to achieve this is by creating a new RGBA image with a white background, pasting the input image onto this new image with correct transparency handling, and then converting the final image to RGB format.

### Corrected Function
Here is the corrected version of the `convert_image` function:

```python
def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
    if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA':
        # Create a new RGBA image with white background
        background = Image.new('RGBA', image.size, (255, 255, 255, 255))
        # Paste the input image correctly with transparency handling
        background.paste(image, (0, 0), image)
        # Convert the image to RGB format
        image = background.convert('RGB')
    elif image.mode != 'RGB':
        image = image.convert('RGB')

    if size:
        image = image.copy()
        image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)

    buf = BytesIO()
    image.save(buf, 'JPEG')
    return image, buf
```

This corrected version handles transparency correctly when converting images with RGBA mode and PNG format, ensuring that the color values are calculated accurately during the conversion process.
