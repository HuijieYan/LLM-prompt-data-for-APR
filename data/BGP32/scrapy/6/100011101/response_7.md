### Bug Explanation
The bug occurs in the function `convert_image` when converting an image from RGBA to RGB. The bug causes a loss of transparency in the image, which leads to incorrect color values. Specifically, in Case 3 where the input image is in PNG format with RGBA mode, the bug overwrites the transparency values with a white background. This results in incorrect color values in the converted image and causes the test to fail.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that transparency is preserved when converting an image from RGBA to RGB. One way to achieve this is by creating a new image with an RGB background and then pasting the RGBA image onto it. This approach will preserve the transparency values in the converted image.

### Corrected Function
```python
def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
    if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA':
        background = Image.new('RGBA', image.size, (0, 0, 0, 0))  # Create a transparent background
        background.paste(image, (0, 0), image)  # Paste the original image with transparency onto the background
        image = background.convert('RGB')
    elif image.mode != 'RGB':
        image = image.convert('RGB')

    if size:
        image = image.copy()
        image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)

    buf = BytesIO()
    image.save(buf, 'JPEG')
    return image, buf
```

By creating a new image with a transparent background and pasting the original image onto it, the corrected function preserves transparency when converting from RGBA to RGB. This fix should ensure that the converted images maintain the correct color values and pass the failing tests.
