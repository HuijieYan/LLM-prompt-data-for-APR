### Bug Analysis
The bug in the provided function `convert_image` is related to the conversion of images with transparency (RGBA) to RGB format. The bug occurs when the input image is in PNG format and has an RGBA mode. The function is supposed to convert PNG images with RGBA mode to RGB mode, however, instead of removing the alpha channel and blending the image with a white background, it directly converts the image to RGB mode without considering the transparency.

### Bug Explanation
1. When the function receives an image in PNG format with RGBA mode, it is expected to create a new RGBA background image filled with white and paste the input image on it. Then, convert this new image to RGB.
2. However, the buggy code directly converts the input PNG RGBA image to RGB without handling the transparency or pasting it onto a white background. Hence, this causes the transparency information to be lost in the conversion process.

### Bug Fix
To fix the bug, we need to address the issue of transparency in PNG RGBA images. The corrected function should paste the RGBA image onto a white background before converting it to RGB. Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
    if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA':
        background = Image.new('RGBA', image.size, (255, 255, 255))
        background.paste(image, (0, 0), image)
        image = background.convert('RGB')
    elif image.mode != 'RGB':
        image = image.convert('RGB')

    if size:
        image = image.copy()
        image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)

    buf = BytesIO()
    image.save(buf, 'JPEG')
    return image, buf
```

This corrected version first creates a new RGBA background image, pastes the original RGBA image onto it, and then converts the composite image to RGB format, ensuring that transparency is maintained during the conversion process.
