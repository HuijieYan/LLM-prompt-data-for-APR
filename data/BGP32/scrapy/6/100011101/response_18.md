### Explanation
The bug in the `convert_image` function arises from the condition that checks if an image is in PNG format and has RGBA mode. When this condition is met, the function tries to create a new RGBA image with a white background and paste the original image onto it. However, the `paste` method does not work correctly in this context and results in the unexpected behavior observed in the failing tests.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we should ensure that images with PNG format and RGBA mode are handled correctly. Instead of trying to paste the image onto a white background, we should convert it to RGB directly while maintaining the original transparency. Then we need to apply the resizing logic to handle the image according to the specified size (if provided).

### Updated Corrected Function
Here is the corrected version of the `convert_image` function:

```python
def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
    if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA':
        # Convert the RGBA image to RGB while preserving transparency
        image = image.convert('RGB')

    elif image.mode != 'RGB':
        # Convert any other mode to RGB
        image = image.convert('RGB')

    if size:
        image = image.copy()
        image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)

    buf = BytesIO()
    image.save(buf, 'JPEG')
    return image, buf
```

By directly converting PNG images with RGBA mode to RGB, we avoid the issue with pasting onto a background. This should now handle image conversions and resizing as expected in the failing test cases.
