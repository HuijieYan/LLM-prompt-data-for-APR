### Bug Explanation:
The bug in the `convert_image` function lies in the RGBA to RGB conversion logic. When the input image is in RGBA format (PNG), the function copies the RGBA image onto a new RGBA background with white color (255, 255, 255). However, when pasting the original image onto the white background, the `paste` method requires the second argument to be a tuple representing the region to paste. In this case, passing `image` as the second argument instead of a tuple causes the original image to be pasted and used as a blending mask, resulting in incorrect color values after conversion to RGB.

### Bug Fix:
To fix the bug, we need to modify the way the image is pasted onto the background. Instead of passing `image` as the second argument to the `paste` method, we should pass a tuple representing the region. 

### Corrected Function:
```python
def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
    if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA':
        background = Image.new('RGBA', image.size, (255, 255, 255))
        background.paste(image, (0, 0), image)
        image = background.convert('RGB')
    elif image.mode != 'RGB':
        image = image.convert('RGB')

    if size:
        image = image.copy()
        image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)

    buf = BytesIO()
    image.save(buf, 'JPEG')
    return image, buf
```

By using the corrected version of the `convert_image` function, the RGBA to RGB conversion will be done correctly, fixing the failing tests and ensuring the expected input/output values are satisfied.
