The bug in the `convert_image` function is causing the test cases to fail because the function is incorrectly handling images with transparency. When the input image is in PNG format and RGBA mode, the function is replacing the transparent background with white, which is not the expected behavior.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the function to handle images with transparency correctly. Instead of replacing the transparent background with white, we should preserve the transparency channel in the output image.

Here is the corrected version of the `convert_image` function:

```python
from PIL import Image
from cStringIO import StringIO as BytesIO

def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
    if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA':
        image = image.convert('RGBA')  # ensure the image is in RGBA mode
    elif image.mode != 'RGB':
        image = image.convert('RGB')

    if size:
        image = image.copy()
        image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)

    buf = BytesIO()
    image.save(buf, 'JPEG')
    return image, buf
```

By converting the input PNG images with RGBA mode to RGBA mode (to preserve transparency), we ensure that the function behaves correctly for images with transparency.

After implementing this fix, the `convert_image` function should pass all the failing test cases and satisfy the expected input/output values.
