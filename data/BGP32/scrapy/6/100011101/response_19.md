### Bug Explanation:
The bug in the `convert_image` function arises from the incorrect handling of PNG images in RGBA mode. The function is supposed to convert images to RGB mode for consistent processing. However, when the input image is in PNG format and RGBA mode, the function mistakenly creates a new RGBA background image filled with white and pastes the original image onto it, thinking that this would help convert transparency to white background. This approach is incorrect as it loses the alpha channel information during the conversion.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. When handling PNG images with RGBA mode, the function should first convert the image directly to RGB mode without creating a new background image.
2. Ensure that the alpha channel information is preserved during the conversion.

### Corrected Function:
```python
def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
    if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA':
        image = image.convert('RGB')
    else:
        image = image.convert('RGB')

    if size:
        image = image.copy()
        image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)

    buf = BytesIO()
    image.save(buf, 'JPEG')
    return image, buf
``` 

By making these changes, the function should now handle PNG images with RGBA mode correctly without losing the alpha channel information, thus passing all the failing tests.
