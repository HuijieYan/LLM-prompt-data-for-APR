### Bug Explanation
The bug in the `convert_image` function arises from incorrect handling of images with a mode of 'RGBA' and format of 'PNG'. When encountering an image with these properties, the code incorrectly creates a new RGBA background image and pastes the original image on top of it. This operation results in a transparent image overlaid on top of a white background, which leads to incorrect color values in the output image.

Specifically, when converting an image with mode 'RGBA' and format 'PNG', the original image is pasted on a white background, changing the color values in the output image and causing the failing tests.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix this bug, the conversion process for images with mode 'RGBA' and format 'PNG' needs to be revised. Instead of pasting the original image on a white background, the alpha channel should be explicitly considered.

### Corrected Code
```python
def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
    if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA':
        image = image.convert("RGB")
    elif image.mode != 'RGB':
        image = image.convert('RGB')

    if size:
        image = image.copy()
        image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)

    buf = BytesIO()
    image.save(buf, 'JPEG')
    return image, buf
```

With this corrected code, the function correctly handles images with mode 'RGBA' and format 'PNG' by converting them to 'RGB' directly, preserving the color values without introducing an incorrect white background.
