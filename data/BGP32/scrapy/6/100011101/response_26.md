### Explanation:
The buggy function has an issue with how it handles images with transparency (RGBA) when the format is PNG. The function is supposed to convert the image to RGB and remove the transparency. However, in the buggy code, the `paste` method is incorrectly used within the `if` condition block for PNG images with RGBA mode. This causes the incorrect background to be pasted onto the image, resulting in incorrect output.

### Bug:
The buggy function incorrectly pastes the image over a white background when the image format is PNG with RGBA mode. This leads to discrepancies in the output when the image has transparency, causing the test cases to fail.

### Fix strategy:
To fix the bug, the function should correctly handle PNG images with RGBA mode by pasting the image without a background when converting it to RGB.

### Corrected code:
```python
def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
    if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA':
        image = image.convert('RGB')
    elif image.mode != 'RGB':
        image = image.convert('RGB')

    if size:
        image = image.copy()
        image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)

    buf = BytesIO()
    image.save(buf, 'JPEG')
    return image, buf
```

By adjusting the behavior for PNG images with RGBA mode to directly convert to RGB without introducing a background, the function should now handle transparency correctly. This corrected version should pass the failing test cases and produce the expected output.
