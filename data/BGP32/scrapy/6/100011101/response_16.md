### Bug Explanation
The bug arises from the conversion logic in the `convert_image` function. When the input image has a format of `'PNG'` and a mode of `'RGBA'`, the function creates a new image (`background`) with a white background and pastes the input image on top of it. However, when pasting the image, the `paste` method expects a tuple representing the top-left corner, but `image` is mistakenly provided in place of it. This results in an error where the transparency information is not correctly handled, leading to incorrect image conversion.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to correctly paste the input image on top of the white background by providing the correct position tuple. This will ensure that the transparency information is preserved during the conversion process.

### Corrected Version of the Function
```python
def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
    if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA':
        background = Image.new('RGBA', image.size, (255, 255, 255))
        background.paste(image, (0, 0), image)  # Corrected the paste method with position tuple
        image = background.convert('RGB')
    elif image.mode != 'RGB':
        image = image.convert('RGB')

    if size:
        image = image.copy()
        image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)

    buf = BytesIO()
    image.save(buf, 'JPEG')
    return image, buf
```

By making this correction in the `paste` method to provide the correct position, the function should now handle the transparency information correctly during the conversion process, resolving the bug and passing the failing tests.
