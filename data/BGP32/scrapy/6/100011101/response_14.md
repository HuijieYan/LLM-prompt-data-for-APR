### Analysis
The buggy function has several issues:
1. It incorrectly handles PNG images with RGBA mode by converting them to RGB without considering the transparency channel.
2. The background image is created with RGBA mode, but it should be created with RGB mode for the paste operation.

### Bug Fix Strategy
1. Check the image mode for PNG images before converting them to RGB. Keep the transparency channel intact if the image mode is RGBA.
2. When creating the background image, specify the mode as 'RGB' to ensure that the paste operation works correctly.

### The corrected version of the function

```python
def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
    if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA':
        background = Image.new('RGB', image.size, (255, 255, 255))
        background.paste(image, image)
        image = background
    elif image.mode != 'RGB':
        image = image.convert('RGB')

    if size:
        image = image.copy()
        image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)

    buf = BytesIO()
    image.save(buf, 'JPEG')
    return image, buf
``` 

After making these corrections, the function should now handle PNG images with RGBA mode appropriately and maintain the transparency channel if needed. The background image is created with the correct mode 'RGB' to ensure that the paste operation functions as intended.
