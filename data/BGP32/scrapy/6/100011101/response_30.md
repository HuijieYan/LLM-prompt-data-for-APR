### Bug Explanation
The bug occurs due to incorrect handling of the image format and mode within the `convert_image` function. When the input image is in PNG format and RGBA mode, the function incorrectly converts it to an RGB mode without preserving the alpha channel. This results in a loss of color information and causes the test to fail.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that when the input image is in PNG format and RGBA mode, the function preserves the transparency information by converting it correctly to RGB. We should use a different approach to handle this specific case.

### Corrected Function
```python
def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
    if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA':
        image = image.convert('RGBA')  # Convert to RGBA to ensure transparency information is preserved
    else:
        image = image.convert('RGB')

    if size:
        image = image.copy()
        image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)

    buf = BytesIO()
    image.save(buf, 'JPEG')
    return image, buf
```

By converting the image to RGBA instead of creating a new background image with RGB values, we ensure that transparency information is preserved when dealing with PNG images in RGBA mode. This correction should pass all the failing test cases and retain the expected input/output values.
