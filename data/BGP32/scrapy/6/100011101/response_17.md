### Bug Explanation
The bug in the `convert_image` function arises from incorrectly handling PNG images with RGBA mode. When an image is PNG and in RGBA mode, the function attempts to create a new RGBA background image with white color and paste the original image on it. However, the correct approach is to create an RGB background image, as the intention is to remove the alpha channel while maintaining the colors. This incorrect handling leads to incorrect conversion and mismatched color values, causing the failing tests.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug in the `convert_image` function, the logic for handling PNG images with RGBA mode needs correction. Specifically, when handling PNG images with RGBA mode, it's necessary to create an RGB background image instead of RGBA. Additionally, the incorrect behavior of pasting the original image on the background should be updated to simply convert the original image to RGB format.

### Corrected Function
```python
# The corrected version of the convert_image function
def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
    if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA':
        background = Image.new('RGB', image.size, (255, 255, 255))
        background.paste(image, (0, 0), image)
        image = background.convert('RGB')
    elif image.mode != 'RGB':
        image = image.convert('RGB')

    if size:
        image = image.copy()
        image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)

    buf = BytesIO()
    image.save(buf, 'JPEG')
    return image, buf
```

After applying this corrected version of the function, the failing tests related to PNG images with RGBA mode should pass. Make sure to run comprehensive tests to validate the function's correctness across different scenarios.
