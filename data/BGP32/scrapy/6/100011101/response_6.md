### Bug Explanation
The bug is in the conversion process of images. When the input image format is 'PNG' and mode is 'RGBA', the function creates a new RGBA image called `background`, pastes the original image onto it, and then converts it to 'RGB'. However, the issue arises because the background is created as an RGBA image, but the pasted image is RGBA as well, leading to an unwanted layer of transparency that affects the overall appearance after conversion to RGB.

### Fix Strategy
To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the background image created is in RGB mode instead of RGBA when pasting the original image. This way, when we convert the composite image to RGB, the transparency from the original RGBA image will not interfere.

### Corrected Function
```python
def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
    if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA':
        background = Image.new('RGB', image.size, (255, 255, 255))
        background.paste(image, (0, 0), image)
        image = background.convert('RGB')
    elif image.mode != 'RGB':
        image = image.convert('RGB')

    if size:
        image = image.copy()
        image.thumbnail(size)

    buf = BytesIO()
    image.save(buf, 'JPEG')
    return image, buf
``` 

By creating the background image in RGB mode and pasting the original image using `background.paste(image, (0, 0), image)`, we ensure that the transparency doesn't interfere with the RGB conversion process. This corrected function should now pass the failing test cases.
