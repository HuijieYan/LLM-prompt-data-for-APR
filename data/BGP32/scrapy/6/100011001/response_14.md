### Bug Analysis
The bug in the `convert_image` function lies in the conditional statement checking if the image format is `'PNG'` and the mode is `'RGBA'`. When these conditions are met, the function creates a new `background` image with a white background and tries to paste the original image onto it. However, the `paste` method is used incorrectly, causing the background image to be pasted onto itself instead of the original image. This results in the image converting to RGB format but retaining incorrect colors due to this incorrect pasting.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to correct the way the original image is pasted onto the background image when the format is `'PNG'` and mode is `'RGBA'`. Instead of `background.paste(image, image)`, we should only paste the original image onto the background. Additionally, we should ensure that the alpha channel is considered when pasting the RGBA image onto the RGB background.

### Corrected Function

```python
def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
    if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA':
        background = Image.new('RGBA', image.size, (255, 255, 255))
        background.paste(image, (0, 0), image)  # Correct way to paste RGBA image onto RGBA background
        image = background.convert('RGB')
    elif image.mode != 'RGB':
        image = image.convert('RGB')

    if size:
        image = image.copy()
        image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)

    buf = BytesIO()
    image.save(buf, 'JPEG')
    return image, buf
```

By using the correct `paste` method, the original image will be properly pasted onto the white background, ensuring that the colors are preserved correctly during conversion. This fix should address the failing test cases and correctly convert images with various formats and modes.
