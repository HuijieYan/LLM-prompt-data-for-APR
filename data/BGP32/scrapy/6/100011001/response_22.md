### Explanation:
The bug in the `convert_image` function lies in the conditional check for PNG images with RGBA mode. In the case where the input image is PNG with RGBA mode, the code is converting the image to RGB format by creating a new background image with a white background and pasting the input image on top. However, the `paste` function is not used correctly in this context, resulting in an incorrect conversion.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix this bug, we need to correct the way we paste the RGBA image onto a white background before converting it to RGB. We should use the `alpha_composite` method of the `Image` class instead of `paste` to correctly handle transparency during the conversion.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
    if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA':
        background = Image.new('RGBA', image.size, (255, 255, 255, 255))
        background = Image.alpha_composite(background, image)
        image = background.convert('RGB')
    elif image.mode != 'RGB':
        image = image.convert('RGB')

    if size:
        image = image.copy()
        image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)

    buf = BytesIO()
    image.save(buf, 'JPEG')
    return image, buf
```

By using `Image.alpha_composite` correctly, we ensure that the transparency from the RGBA image is preserved when converting it to RGB. This correction should address the issue with the failing tests.
