### Bug Analysis:
The bug occurs when the input image is in PNG format and RGBA mode. The function attempts to convert this image to RGB mode but fails to handle transparency properly. When the alpha channel is removed, the resulting color values are incorrect, leading to failing tests related to color comparison.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that transparency in the input image is handled correctly when converting from RGBA to RGB. One way to handle transparency is by creating a new white background with an alpha channel and overlaying the input image on this background before converting it to RGB mode.

### Corrected Function:
```python
def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
    if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA':
        # Create a white background with alpha channel
        background = Image.new('RGBA', image.size, (255, 255, 255, 255))
        background.paste(image, (0, 0), image)
        image = background.convert('RGB')
    elif image.mode != 'RGB':
        image = image.convert('RGB')

    if size:
        image = image.copy()
        image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)

    buf = BytesIO()
    image.save(buf, 'JPEG')
    return image, buf
```

By introducing a new white background with an alpha channel and pasting the original image onto it, we can handle transparency issues properly during the conversion process. This corrected version of the function should pass the failing tests related to color comparison.
