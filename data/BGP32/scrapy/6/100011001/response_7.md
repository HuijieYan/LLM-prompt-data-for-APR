### Explanation:
The buggy function is intended to convert images to RGB format. However, there is an issue with the logic. When the input image format is PNG and the mode is RGBA, the function creates a new image with a white background and pastes the original image on top of it. This step is causing the transparency to be lost and resulting in incorrect colors.

### Bug:
The bug is in the handling of PNG images with RGBA mode. When converting these images, the function creates a new image with a white background, which flattens the transparency and distorts the colors.

### Fix:
To fix the bug, we need to handle PNG images with RGBA mode differently to preserve transparency. Instead of creating a new image with a white background, we should directly convert the RGBA image to RGB without changes to avoid color distortion.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
    if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA':
        image = image.convert('RGB')
    elif image.mode != 'RGB':
        image = image.convert('RGB')

    if size:
        image = image.copy()
        image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)

    buf = BytesIO()
    image.save(buf, 'JPEG')
    return image, buf
```

By directly converting RGBA PNG images to RGB without adding a white background, we can preserve transparency and colors correctly.
