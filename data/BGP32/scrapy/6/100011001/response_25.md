### Bug analysis
The bug in the `convert_image` function is causing the test to fail because when an image with mode 'P' (palette) is passed, it is incorrectly converted to 'RGB', resulting in a different image that causes the test to fail.

### Bug identification
The bug is identified in the section where the function checks for the image mode. When the mode is not 'RGB', the function converts the image to 'RGB'. This conversion is incorrect for images with mode 'P' (palette).

### Bug explanation
When the function receives an image with mode 'P', it converts it to 'RGB' unconditionally. This results in a change in the image colors and properties, leading to a failed assertion in the test case.

### Bug fix strategy
To fix the bug, we need to handle the 'P' mode images differently. Instead of unconditionally converting them to 'RGB', we should check if the mode is 'P' before making any conversions. If the mode is 'P', we should handle it appropriately without changing the colors or properties of the image.

### Corrected function
```python
def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
    if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA':
        background = Image.new('RGBA', image.size, (255, 255, 255))
        background.paste(image, image)
        image = background.convert('RGB')
    elif image.mode != 'RGB':
        if image.mode == 'P':
            image = image.convert('RGBA')
        image = image.convert('RGB')

    if size:
        image = image.copy()
        image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)

    buf = BytesIO()
    image.save(buf, 'JPEG')
    return image, buf
```

By handling the 'P' mode images differently and converting them to 'RGBA' instead of 'RGB', we ensure that the original colors and properties are maintained for 'P' mode images, fixing the bug in the `convert_image` function.
