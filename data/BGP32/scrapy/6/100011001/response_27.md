### Bug Explanation
The bug in the `convert_image` function arises when dealing with PNG images in RGBA mode. In the buggy implementation, when the image format is PNG and mode is RGBA, the code creates a new RGBA background, pastes the original image on it, and then converts it to RGB. However, this method of converting the image results in the loss of transparency information. Therefore, the converted image loses the original transparency values, resulting in failing test cases.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to handle the conversion of PNG images in RGBA mode differently. Instead of pasting the original image onto a white background and then converting it to RGB, we need to calculate a new background based on the alpha channel of the original image before converting it to RGB. This way, we can preserve the transparency information of the image.

### Corrected Version of the Function
Here is the corrected version of the `convert_image` function:

```python
def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
    if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA':
        background = Image.new('RGBA', image.size, (255, 255, 255, 255))
        alpha = image.split()[3]
        background.putalpha(alpha)
        background.paste(image, (0, 0), mask=alpha)
        image = background.convert('RGB')
    elif image.mode != 'RGB':
        image = image.convert('RGB')

    if size:
        image = image.copy()
        image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)

    buf = BytesIO()
    image.save(buf, 'JPEG')
    return image, buf
```

This corrected version ensures that PNG images in RGBA mode retain their transparency information during the conversion process.
