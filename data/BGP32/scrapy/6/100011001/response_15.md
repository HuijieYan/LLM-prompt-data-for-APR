### Bug Analysis
The buggy function has a conditional statement to handle images with PNG format and RGBA mode. However, the code inside this conditional block does not correctly convert the image to RGB format while handling transparency. This leads to incorrect color values being compared against the expected values in the failing test.

### Bug Explanation
In Case 3, when handling images with PNG format and RGBA mode, the background image is created, and the original image is pasted onto it. However, the paste operation does not handle transparency correctly, leading to incorrect color values in the resulting image. This results in the failing test as the expected color values are different due to incorrect conversion.

### Bug Fix
To fix the bug, we need to properly handle transparency when pasting the RGBA image onto the RGB background. We should use the `paste` method with the `mask` parameter to handle transparency correctly. Additionally, we need to update the color values for transparency in the failing test to match the corrected conversion.

### Corrected Function
```python
def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
    if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA':
        background = Image.new('RGB', image.size, (255, 255, 255))
        background.paste(image, mask=image.split()[3])
        image = background
    elif image.mode != 'RGB':
        image = image.convert('RGB')

    if size:
        image = image.copy()
        image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)

    buf = BytesIO()
    image.save(buf, 'JPEG')
    return image, buf
```

After applying the corrected function, the failing test should pass as the transparency issue is resolved, and the color values are correctly compared.
