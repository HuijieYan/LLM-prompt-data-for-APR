### Bug Explanation
The bug occurs when the input `image` is in RGBA mode and PNG format. The function tries to convert this image into RGB mode. However, during this conversion, it loses the transparency information since PNG with RGBA mode has an alpha channel for transparency. As a result, the converted image loses transparency, leading to failing tests that check pixel colors.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix this bug, we need to handle the case when the input image is in RGBA mode and PNG format. Instead of directly converting it to RGB, we should create a new white background and paste the RGBA image onto it. This way, we retain the transparency information.

### Corrected Version

```python
def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
    if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA':
        background = Image.new('RGB', image.size, (255, 255, 255))
        background.paste(image, (0, 0), image)
        image = background
    elif image.mode != 'RGB':
        image = image.convert('RGB')

    if size:
        image = image.copy()
        image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)

    buf = BytesIO()
    image.save(buf, 'JPEG')
  
    return image, buf
```

By pasting the RGBA image onto a new RGB background and returning it, we retain transparency information while converting the image.
