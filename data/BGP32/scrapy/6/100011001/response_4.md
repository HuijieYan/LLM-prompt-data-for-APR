### Analysis
The buggy function is intended to convert images to RGB mode and save them in JPEG format. The issue arises when dealing with images that are PNG and have an RGBA mode. The function attempts to paste the image onto a new RGBA background and convert it to RGB, altering the colors in the process.

In Case 3, the function is converting an RGBA PNG image to RGB mode but is not handling transparency correctly, resulting in colors being distorted.

### Bug
The bug is caused by the incorrect handling of transparency when converting PNG images in RGBA mode to RGB mode. The background created to handle transparency does not effectively preserve the original colors, leading to incorrect results.

### Fix
To fix the bug, we need to handle transparency correctly when converting PNG images in RGBA mode to RGB mode. We can achieve this by creating a new blank RGB image with the same size as the original one and then pasting the original image onto it, overlaying the transparent portions with a white background.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
    if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA':
        background = Image.new('RGBA', image.size, (255, 255, 255, 255))
        background.paste(image, (0, 0), image)
        image = background.convert('RGB')
    elif image.mode != 'RGB':
        image = image.convert('RGB')

    if size:
        image = image.copy()
        image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)

    buf = BytesIO()
    image.save(buf, 'JPEG')
    return image, buf
```

This correction ensures that transparency is handled correctly when converting images from RGBA mode to RGB mode.
