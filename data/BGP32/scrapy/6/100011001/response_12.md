The bug in the provided function is related to the conversion of images with transparency (RGBA) and PNG format to RGB. In the `convert_image` function, there is a conditional block that checks if the image format is PNG and mode is RGBA, and then it attempts to convert the image to RGB by pasting it on a white background. However, the `paste` method in PIL requires the source image to be in RGBA mode, not RGB.

To fix the bug, you should modify the way the image is converted from RGBA to RGB by creating a new RGB image and pasting the RGBA image on top.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
from PIL import Image
from cStringIO import StringIO as BytesIO

def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
    if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA':
        background = Image.new('RGBA', image.size, (255, 255, 255, 255))
        background.paste(image, (0, 0), image)
        image = background.convert('RGB')
    elif image.mode != 'RGB':
        image = image.convert('RGB')

    if size:
        image = image.copy()
        image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)

    buf = BytesIO()
    image.save(buf, 'JPEG')
    return image, buf
```

With this update, the function should correctly handle images with transparency and convert them to RGB without causing the previous error. The corrected version pastes the RGBA image onto a white background before converting it to RGB.
