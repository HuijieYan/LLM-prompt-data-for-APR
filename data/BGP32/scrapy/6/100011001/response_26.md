### Analysis
- The buggy function is supposed to convert images to a specified format and size while handling some specific cases like PNG images with RGBA mode.
- The error message indicates a failure in the `converted.getcolors()` assertion, specifically in comparing the colors of the images after conversion.
- The function seems to be incorrectly handling PNG images with RGBA mode, leading to incorrect color conversion.

### Bug Cause
- When the input image is in PNG format and RGBA mode, the function creates a new RGBA background image, pastes the original image on it, and then converts it to RGB. However, during the paste operation, the original image's alpha channel is not properly handled, resulting in incorrect colors after conversion.

### Bug Fix Strategy
- Ensure that the paste operation of the RGBA image on a new RGBA background image preserves the alpha channel.
- Make sure that the conversion of PNG images with RGBA mode to RGB is correctly handled to maintain image colors after conversion.

### Corrected Function
```python
def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
    if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA':
        background = Image.new('RGBA', image.size, (255, 255, 255, 255))
        background.paste(image, (0, 0), image)
        image = background.convert('RGB')
    elif image.mode != 'RGB':
        image = image.convert('RGB')

    if size:
        image = image.copy()
        image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)

    buf = BytesIO()
    image.save(buf, 'JPEG')
    return image, buf
```

This corrected version ensures that when handling PNG images with RGBA mode, the alpha channel is correctly preserved during the paste operation, which should address the issues seen in the failing test cases.
