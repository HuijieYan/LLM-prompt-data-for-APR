### Bug Analysis
The bug in the `convert_image` function lies in the conditional check for PNG images with RGBA mode. When the input image is a PNG image with RGBA mode, the function is supposed to convert it to RGB mode and handle the transparency properly. However, the current implementation fails to do so correctly, leading to incorrect output in certain cases.

Analyzing the failing test cases:
1. In Case 3, the test expects the output to be an RGB image with a specific color, but the actual output is not as expected.
2. In Case 4, the input image is initially in mode 'P', but the function incorrectly converts it to RGB mode without handling transparency.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to update the logic in the function to correctly handle PNG images with RGBA mode. Specifically, we need to handle transparency information and convert the image to RGB mode while maintaining the color information.

### Corrected Version of the Function
```python
def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
    if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA':
        background = Image.new('RGB', image.size, (255, 255, 255))
        background.paste(image, image)
        image = background
    elif image.mode != 'RGB':
        image = image.convert('RGB')

    if size:
        image = image.copy()
        image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)

    buf = BytesIO()
    image.save(buf, 'JPEG')
    return image, buf
```

By correcting the conversion handling for RGBA images and updating the logic to handle transparency correctly, this corrected version of the function should pass the failing test cases.
