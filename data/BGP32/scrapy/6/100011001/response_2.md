### Bug Analysis
The bug in the `convert_image` function is that when the input image has the format 'PNG' and the mode 'RGBA', the function attempts to paste the image onto a new RGBA background with white color before converting it to RGB. This causes the color conversion to be incorrect, leading to failing tests.

In Case 3, when the input image is PNG with RGBA mode, the function creates a white RGBA background and pastes the image onto it. This step alters the colors in the image, and hence the failing test that compares the colors of the converted image to an expected value fails.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to handle images with PNG format and RGBA mode differently. Instead of pasting the image onto a white background, we need to convert the image to RGB directly, preserving the original colors.

### Corrected Version of the Function
```python
from PIL import Image
from cStringIO import StringIO as BytesIO

def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
    if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA':
        image = image.convert('RGB')
    elif image.mode != 'RGB':
        image = image.convert('RGB')

    if size:
        image = image.copy()
        image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)

    buf = BytesIO()
    image.save(buf, 'JPEG')
    return image, buf
```

By directly converting PNG images with RGBA mode to RGB without pasting onto a background, the corrected function ensures that the colors are preserved correctly. This fix should resolve the failing test cases.
