### Bug Analysis
The bug in the `convert_image` function seems to be related to the handling of PNG images with RGBA mode. The function is incorrectly converting RGBA images to RGB format without considering the alpha channel values, leading to incorrect colors in the output.

1. In Case 3, the input is a PNG image with RGBA mode, and the function tries to convert it to RGB without properly handling the alpha channel, resulting in a loss of transparency information.
2. The bug is due to the condition `image.mode != 'RGB'` not accounting for the RGBA mode and converting it directly to RGB, discarding the alpha channel information.
3. As a result, the converted image loses transparency, causing the test to fail when comparing colors.
4. To fix the bug, we need to handle RGBA images differently, preserving the transparency information during the conversion process.

### Bug Fix
Here is the corrected version of the `convert_image` function:

```python
def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
    if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA':
        background = Image.new('RGBA', image.size, (255, 255, 255, 255))
        background.paste(image, image)
        image = background.convert('RGBA').convert('RGB')
    elif image.mode != 'RGB':
        image = image.convert('RGB')

    if size:
        image = image.copy()
        image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)

    buf = BytesIO()
    image.save(buf, 'JPEG')
    return image, buf
```

By first converting RGBA images to RGB via an intermediate conversion to RGBA format, the corrected version should properly handle transparency during the conversion process. This fix should make the function handle RGBA images correctly and pass the failing test cases.
