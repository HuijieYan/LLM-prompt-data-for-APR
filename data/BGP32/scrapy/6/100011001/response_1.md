### Bug Explanation:
The bug in the `convert_image` function arises from the conditional check for PNG format images with RGBA mode. When the image format is PNG and the mode is RGBA, the function is supposed to create a new RGBA background image and then paste the original image onto it. However, there is a mistake in the way the image is pasted onto the background. Instead of using the `paste` method correctly, the function is passing the original image itself as an argument to `paste`, resulting in an incorrect conversion.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to correct the line where the image is pasted onto the background. This can be achieved by changing `background.paste(image, image)` to `background.paste(image, (0, 0), image)`. This change correctly pastes the original image onto the background image in the specified position.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
    if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA':
        background = Image.new('RGBA', image.size, (255, 255, 255))
        background.paste(image, (0, 0), image)
        image = background.convert('RGB')
    elif image.mode != 'RGB':
        image = image.convert('RGB')

    if size:
        image = image.copy()
        image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)

    buf = BytesIO()
    image.save(buf, 'JPEG')
    return image, buf
``` 

By making this correction, the `convert_image` function should now correctly handle the conversion of PNG format images with RGBA mode, and the failing test cases should pass.
