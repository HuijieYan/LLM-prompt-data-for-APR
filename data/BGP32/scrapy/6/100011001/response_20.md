### Bug Analysis
The bug seems to be related to the image conversion logic inside the `convert_image` function. In case 3, when the input image format is 'PNG' and the mode is 'RGBA', the function tries to create a new image, `background`, with RGBA mode and then paste the original image on it. However, the usage of `background.paste(image, image)` is causing the background to be transparent since the image itself is RGBA. This results in the background being the same as the image, leading to transparency issues.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to handle the case when the image is RGBA differently. We should create a new image with a white background and paste the original image on it to remove the transparency. This change should fix the failing test cases.

### Corrected Code
```python
def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
    if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA':
        background = Image.new('RGBA', image.size, (255, 255, 255, 255))  # Fix transparency issue by setting alpha to 255
        background.paste(image, (0, 0), mask=image)  # Paste the original image on a white background
        image = background.convert('RGB')
    elif image.mode != 'RGB':
        image = image.convert('RGB')

    if size:
        image = image.copy()
        image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)

    buf = BytesIO()
    image.save(buf, 'JPEG')
    return image, buf
``` 

By making the above changes to construct and paste the image properly with a white background, the transparency issues should be resolved, and the failing test cases should pass.
