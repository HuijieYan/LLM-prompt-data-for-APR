### Bug Analysis:
The bug in the `convert_image` function is related to handling transparency in images. When the input image is in the PNG format with RGBA mode, the function is supposed to replace the transparent background with a white background before converting it to RGB. However, the buggy implementation pastes the image onto a white background correctly, but then attempts to convert the whole image to RGB, which results in losing the transparency information.

### Bug Explanation:
1. In Case 3, when the input image is PNG with RGBA mode, the function creates a white background and pastes the image onto it. Then it converts the whole image to RGB, which removes the transparency, leading to the wrong color values in the converted image.

### Bug Fix:
To fix the bug, we need to handle transparency properly. Instead of directly converting the image to RGB after pasting it onto a white background, we should first create a new image with RGB mode only and then paste the converted image onto it.

### Corrected Function:
```python
def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
    if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA':
        background = Image.new('RGB', image.size, (255, 255, 255))
        background.paste(image, image)
        image = background

    if image.mode != 'RGB':
        image = image.convert('RGB')

    if size:
        image = image.copy()
        image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)

    buf = BytesIO()
    image.save(buf, 'JPEG')
    return image, buf
```

After applying this fix, the function will correctly handle images with transparency, ensuring that the alpha channel is maintained when converting from PNG with RGBA mode to RGB. This fix should make the failing test cases pass without any assertion errors.
