### Bug Analysis:
The bug in the `convert_image` function is in the section where it handles PNG images with RGBA mode. When the condition `if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA':` is met, the code creates a new RGBA background image filled with white, pastes the original image on top of it, and then converts it to RGB format. However, the issue here is that in the `paste` function call, the second argument should be a tuple representing the upper left point where the image should be pasted, not the image itself.

This bug results in the wrong conversion of RGBA PNG images to RGB format, leading to failing tests.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to modify the way the image is pasted onto the background image. Instead of passing `image` as the second argument to the `paste` function, we should pass the point `(0, 0)` to correctly paste the image onto the background.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
    if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA':
        background = Image.new('RGBA', image.size, (255, 255, 255))
        background.paste(image, (0, 0))
        image = background.convert('RGB')
    elif image.mode != 'RGB':
        image = image.convert('RGB')

    if size:
        image = image.copy()
        image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)

    buf = BytesIO()
    image.save(buf, 'JPEG')
    return image, buf
``` 

By making this change, the function will correctly paste the RGBA PNG image in the background and convert it to RGB, which should now pass the failing test cases.
