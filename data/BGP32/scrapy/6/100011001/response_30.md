### Potential Error Locations:
1. The condition `if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA':` could be affecting the conversion logic.
2. The `paste()` method usage could be incorrect.
3. Handling transparency might not be correct, causing issues in converting images with alpha channels.

### Bug Explanation:
Based on the provided error message and the runtime input/output values, the bug seems to be related to the conversion of images with transparency (alpha channels). In the failing test, when attempting to convert an RGBA image, the expected result does not match the actual output due to incorrect handling of transparency during the conversion process. The `getcolors()` method is used to check the colors present after conversion, and the comparison fails due to an incorrect conversion process.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Ensure that transparency in RGBA images is correctly handled during conversion.
2. Check the conditions and logic related to image format and mode to ensure proper conversion.
3. Properly handle transparency cases and conversion to RGB when needed.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
    if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA':
        background = Image.new('RGB', image.size, (255, 255, 255))
        background.paste(image, (0, 0), image)
        image = background
    elif image.mode != 'RGB':
        image = image.convert('RGB')

    if size:
        image = image.copy()
        image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)

    buf = BytesIO()
    image.save(buf, 'JPEG')
    return image, buf
```

By correcting the handling of RGBA images, ensuring proper pasting of images with transparency, and correcting the conversion logic, the corrected function should now properly convert images without errors.
