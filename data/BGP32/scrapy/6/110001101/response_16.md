### Analysis
The buggy function `convert_image` is intended to handle image format conversions and resizing. There are several issues identified based on the runtime values and expected values provided for different cases:
1. The conditional check for PNG format and RGBA mode is incorrect as it should convert the image format to RGB if this condition is met, but it is converting to JPG unconditionally.
2. The resizing logic seems to be working correctly, but the format conversion logic has a bug.

### Bug
The main bug in the function is the incorrect format conversion when the input image format is PNG and mode is RGBA. It should convert the image to RGB format, but it currently converts to JPEG.

### Fix
To fix the bug, we need to update the conditional block that handles PNG format and RGBA mode to correctly convert the image to RGB format.

### Corrected Version
```python
# The corrected version of the buggy function
def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
    if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA':
        background = Image.new('RGBA', image.size, (255, 255, 255))
        background.paste(image, (0, 0), image)
        image = background.convert('RGB')
    elif image.mode != 'RGB':
        image = image.convert('RGB')

    if size:
        image = image.copy()
        image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)

    buf = BytesIO()
    image.save(buf, 'JPEG')
    return image, buf
``` 

With the corrected version, the function will now correctly convert PNG RGBA images to RGB format and handle resizing and format conversion as expected.
