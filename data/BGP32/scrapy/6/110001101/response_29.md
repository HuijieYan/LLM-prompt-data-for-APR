The bug in the provided function `convert_image` is related to the incorrect handling of PNG images with RGBA mode. The function is supposed to convert PNG images with RGBA mode to RGB mode, but the current logic is faulty. The bug causes incorrect image conversion and potentially wrong output.

The main issue lies in the line:
```python
background.paste(image, image)
```
This line tries to paste the image onto itself within the background, which is incorrect. The correct approach would be to simply paste the image onto the background.

To fix the bug, the problematic line needs to be corrected within the conditional block for PNG images with RGBA mode. Additionally, the method `paste` should be used correctly.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
    if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA':
        background = Image.new('RGB', image.size, (255, 255, 255))
        background.paste(image, (0, 0), image)
        image = background
    elif image.mode != 'RGB':
        image = image.convert('RGB')

    if size:
        image = image.copy()
        image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)

    buf = BytesIO()
    image.save(buf, 'JPEG')
    return image, buf
```

This corrected version should address the issue and provide the expected output values for the given test cases.
