### Bug Analysis:
The bug in the `convert_image` function occurs when the image format is 'PNG' and the mode is 'RGBA'. In this case, the function tries to create a new background image with mode 'RGBA' and then paste the original image onto it, hoping to convert it to 'RGB'. However, the `background.paste` method call does not work as intended because the `paste` method expects a tuple for the second argument (upper left corner coordinates), but the entire image is passed instead. This results in an error.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to correct how the image is pasted onto the background by providing the correct tuple coordinates. Additionally, we should ensure that the input image is converted to 'RGB' format correctly in all cases to prevent runtime errors.

### Updated Corrected Version:
Here is the corrected version of the `convert_image` function:

```python
def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
    if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA':
        background = Image.new('RGBA', image.size, (255, 255, 255))
        background.paste(image, (0, 0), image)
        image = background.convert('RGB')
    else:
        image = image.convert('RGB')

    if size:
        image = image.copy()
        image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)

    buf = BytesIO()
    image.save(buf, 'JPEG')
    return image, buf
```

By correcting how the image is pasted onto the background by providing the correct tuple coordinates and ensuring the conversion to 'RGB' mode, this updated version should now handle the different image formats and modes correctly, preventing the previous runtime errors.
