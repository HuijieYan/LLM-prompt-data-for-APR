### Analysis
The buggy function `convert_image` is supposed to handle image conversions and resizing. However, there are several issues that need to be addressed:
1. The condition checking for 'PNG' format and 'RGBA' mode is causing unexpected behavior, converting the image to RGB in a way that doesn't match the expected output.
2. The resizing logic could be improved to ensure correct thumbnail creation.
3. The function currently always saves as 'JPEG' format, which might not be ideal for all scenarios.

### Bug Explanation
- In Case 1 and Case 2, the function is expected to preserve the original image format and mode if they are already 'JPEG' and 'RGB' respectively, while resizing as specified. However, the function incorrectly attempts to convert the image to RGB regardless of the current format and mode. This results in inconsistent behavior and incorrect output sizes.
- In Case 3, when the image is in 'PNG' format with 'RGBA' mode, the function is expected to convert the background to white before converting the image to RGB mode. However, the paste operation is incorrect, leading to the wrong output.
- In Case 4, when the image mode is neither 'RGB' nor 'RGBA', the function should convert it to 'RGB' mode. However, it doesn't handle this conversion properly.

### Bug Fix Strategy
1. Adjust the conditional checks to preserve the original format and mode if they match the expected values.
2. Implement the resizing logic correctly to generate thumbnails with the specified size.
3. Allow for flexibility in saving the image in the desired format.

### Corrected Version
```python
def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
    if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA':
        background = Image.new('RGBA', image.size, (255, 255, 255))
        background.paste(image, (0, 0), image)
        image = background.convert('RGB')
    elif image.format != 'JPEG' or image.mode != 'RGB':
        image = image.convert('RGB')

    if size:
        image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)

    buf = BytesIO()
    image.save(buf, image.format)
    return image, buf
``` 

This corrected version ensures that the image format and mode are preserved when they match the expected values, fixes the background paste operation for PNG images with RGBA mode, handles mode conversion correctly for different formats, and saves the image with the original format.
