### Explanation of the bug

The bug occurs in the `convert_image` function where it tries to convert images with specific formats and modes to RGB and use JPEG format for saving the image. 

In Case 1 and Case 2, the function is not correctly checking for the image format before attempting to convert to RGB and save in JPEG format. This leads to unnecessary conversion and saving operations for images that are already in the correct format and can cause potential logic errors.

In Case 3, the bug arises from the incorrect usage of the `paste` method when creating a new background for PNG images with RGBA mode. The `paste` method requires two tuples indicating the (left, upper, right, lower) corners of the region to paste the image. The current implementation incorrectly uses `image` twice in `background.paste(image, image)` instead of providing the correct positioning.

In Case 4, the bug is similar to the issue in Case 3, where the conversion to RGB is not being done correctly for images with mode 'P'.

### Strategy to fix the bug

To fix the bug, the following steps can be taken:
- Check the image format before attempting to convert and save it.
- Make sure to correctly use the `paste` method to create a new background for images with RGBA mode.
- Handle different image modes properly before converting to RGB.
- Check if the image is already in RGB mode before attempting conversion.
- Save the image in the required format after all necessary operations.

### Corrected version of the function

```python
def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
    if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA':
        background = Image.new('RGBA', image.size, (255, 255, 255))
        background.paste(image, (0, 0), image)
        image = background.convert('RGB')
    elif image.mode != 'RGB' and image.mode != 'L' and image.mode != 'RGBA':
        image = image.convert('RGB')

    if size:
        image = image.copy()
        image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)

    buf = BytesIO()
    image.save(buf, 'JPEG')
    return image, buf
```

This corrected version of the `convert_image` function ensures that the image format and mode are correctly handled before making any conversion or saving operations. Additionally, it addresses the issue with the `paste` method for images with RGBA mode.
