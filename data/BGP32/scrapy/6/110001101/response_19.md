### Analysis:
The buggy function `convert_image` is intended to convert an image to a specific format and size. The bug seems to occur when the image format is 'PNG' and the mode is 'RGBA'. In this case, the function creates a new background image and pastes the original image onto it, then converts the image to 'RGB' mode before resizing it.

The bug arises from the line `background.paste(image, image)` where the pasting of the image onto the background needs to be corrected.

### Bug Cause:
The bug occurs due to incorrect usage of the `paste` method. Instead of passing `image` twice to the `paste` method, the correct usage is to provide a tuple `(0, 0)` as the second argument to specify the top-left position to paste the image.

### Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to correct the `paste` method usage by providing the correct coordinates for the pasting operation.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
    if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA':
        background = Image.new('RGBA', image.size, (255, 255, 255))
        background.paste(image, (0, 0))  # Corrected the paste method usage
        image = background.convert('RGB')
    elif image.mode != 'RGB':
        image = image.convert('RGB')

    if size:
        image = image.copy()
        image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)

    buf = BytesIO()
    image.save(buf, 'JPEG')
    return image, buf
```

By making this correction, the `convert_image` function should now correctly handle images with format 'PNG' and mode 'RGBA' without encountering the bug.
