The buggy function has a logical error in the image format check. The function incorrectly assumes that the image format is always 'PNG' when handling RGBA mode images, which causes issues with other image formats like 'JPEG'.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the conditional statement to correctly handle RGBA mode images regardless of the image format. Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
from PIL import Image
from cStringIO import StringIO as BytesIO


class ImagesPipeline(FilesPipeline):
    """
    Abstract pipeline that implement the image thumbnail generation logic
    """

    def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
        if image.mode == 'RGBA':
            background = Image.new('RGBA', image.size, (255, 255, 255))
            background.paste(image, image)
            image = background.convert('RGB')
        elif image.mode != 'RGB':
            image = image.convert('RGB')

        if size:
            image = image.copy()
            image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)

        buf = BytesIO()
        image.save(buf, 'JPEG')
        return image, buf
```

In this corrected version, we have removed the format check from the buggy function and only focus on the image mode. This change ensures that the function handles RGBA mode images correctly for all formats.

This fix should now correctly handle various image formats and modes without reaching errors based on format assumptions.
