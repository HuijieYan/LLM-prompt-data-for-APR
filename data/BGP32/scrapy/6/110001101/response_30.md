### Bug description
The bug in the `convert_image` function lies in the condition checking for the image format and mode to decide whether to convert the image to RGB format. The bug causes incorrect handling of images that are not in the 'PNG' format and 'RGBA' mode, leading to unexpected conversions.

### Strategy for fixing the bug
To fix the bug, the condition checking for the image format and mode needs to be adjusted to cover all possible scenarios. By updating the condition logic, the function will correctly handle images of different formats and modes.

### Corrected version of the function
```python
def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
    if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA':
        background = Image.new('RGBA', image.size, (255, 255, 255))
        background.paste(image, (0, 0))
        image = background.convert('RGB')
    elif image.mode != 'RGB':
        image = image.convert('RGB')

    if size:
        image = image.copy()
        image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)

    buf = BytesIO()
    image.save(buf, 'JPEG')
    return image, buf
``` 

By updating the pasting method inside the condition block, we ensure that the image is created correctly, and we are pasting the image at the correct location to create the background without distorting the image. This adjustment addresses the bug and ensures that the function behaves as expected for different image formats and modes.
