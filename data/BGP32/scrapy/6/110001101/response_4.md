The bug in the provided function is related to the `convert_image` method converting images incorrectly based on their format and mode. The bug is primarily in the condition checking and conversion logic for PNG images with RGBA mode, which then gets converted to RGB mode with a white background. Additionally, the function is saving the image in JPEG format irrespective of the input format.

To fix the bug, we need to correct the condition checking for PNG images with RGBA mode and handle the conversion and saving processes based on the input image format. Here's the corrected version of the `convert_image` function:

```python
from PIL import Image
from cStringIO import StringIO as BytesIO

# The declaration of the class containing the buggy function
class ImagesPipeline(FilesPipeline):
    """
    Abstract pipeline that implement the image thumbnail generation logic

    """

    def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
        if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA':
            background = Image.new('RGBA', image.size, (255, 255, 255))
            background.paste(image, (0, 0), image)
            image = background.convert('RGB')
        else:
            image = image.convert('RGB')

        if size:
            image = image.copy()
            image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)

        buf = BytesIO()
        
        if image.format == 'PNG':
            image.save(buf, 'PNG')
        else:
            image.save(buf, 'JPEG')
        
        return image, buf
```

In the corrected version:
- We properly handle PNG images with RGBA mode by pasting them on a white background before converting to RGB.
- The conversion processes are now correctly based on the input image format (PNG or other formats).
- The image is saved in the same format as the input image format to preserve the original format.

These corrections should address the issues in the buggy function and make it behave according to the expected input/output values provided.
