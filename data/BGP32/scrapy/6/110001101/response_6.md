### Analysis
The buggy function `convert_image(image, size=None)` is intended to handle image conversion and thumbnail generation. The bug is likely stemming from the conditional checks and conversions within the function. 

1. In Case 1 and Case 2, the function should convert the image to RGB format if it's not already, and the thumbnail generation with the provided size should be made accordingly.

2. In Case 3, when the image format is PNG and the mode is RGBA, the function should create a new RGBA background, paste the original image onto it, and convert it to RGB for further processing.

3. In Case 4, when the mode is not RGB, the function should convert the image to RGB for consistency.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug:
1. Address the conditional statements for image format and mode properly.
2. Ensure that the image is converted to RGB when necessary.
3. Handle the thumbnail generation appropriately based on the specified size.

### Corrected Version
```python
def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
    if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA':
        background = Image.new('RGBA', image.size, (255, 255, 255))
        background.paste(image, (0, 0, image.size[0], image.size[1]))
        image = background.convert('RGB')
    elif image.mode != 'RGB':
        image = image.convert('RGB')

    if size:
        image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)

    buf = BytesIO()
    image.save(buf, 'JPEG')
    return image, buf
``` 

This corrected version should now properly handle the conversion and thumbnail generation based on the input image's format and mode.
