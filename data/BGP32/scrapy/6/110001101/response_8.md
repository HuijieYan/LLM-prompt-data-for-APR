### Bug Explanation
The bug in the `convert_image` function lies in the conditional check for the image format and mode. When the image format is `'PNG'` and mode is `'RGBA'`, the code creates a new background image with white color and pastes the original image onto it before converting it to RGB. However, the issue is with the `background.paste(image, image)` line, which is causing the bug. The correct way to paste the image onto the background is by using `background.paste(image, (0, 0), image)`. By not providing the second argument as a tuple with coordinates, it causes the function to fail in correctly pasting the image onto the background.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to correct the way the image is pasted onto the background in the case of an image with PNG format and RGBA mode.

### Corrected Function
```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: scrapy/pipelines/images.py

# The declaration of the class containing the corrected function
class ImagesPipeline(FilesPipeline):
    """
    Abstract pipeline that implement the image thumbnail generation logic
    
        
    """
    def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
        if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA':
            background = Image.new('RGBA', image.size, (255, 255, 255))
            background.paste(image, (0, 0), image)
            image = background.convert('RGB')
        elif image.mode != 'RGB':
            image = image.convert('RGB')
        
        if size:
            image = image.copy()
            image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)
        
        buf = BytesIO()
        image.save(buf, 'JPEG')
        return image, buf
``` 

Now, the corrected function includes the necessary changes to correctly paste the image onto the background, ensuring the function behaves as expected in all scenarios.
