The potential error locations in the buggy function are:
1. In the first if statement, where the logic for checking the image format and mode may not be functioning correctly.
2. In the call to `background.paste(image, image)`, which should likely be `background.paste(image, (0, 0), image)`.
3. The choice of format 'JPEG' in the image.save() function may not be suitable for all types of images.

The cause of the bug is likely due to incorrect handling of image formats and modes, as well as incorrect usage of certain functions in the PIL library.

To fix the bug, we can modify the function as follows:

```python
from PIL import Image
from cStringIO import StringIO as BytesIO

def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
    if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA':
        background = Image.new('RGBA', image.size, (255, 255, 255))
        background.paste(image, (0, 0), image)
        image = background.convert('RGB')
    elif image.mode != 'RGB':
        image = image.convert('RGB')

    if size:
        image = image.copy()
        image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)

    buf = BytesIO()
    image.save(buf, format=image.format)
    return image, buf
```

In the corrected version, we have fixed the paste() function call, specifying the position of the pasted image correctly. Additionally, we used the original image format in the image.save() function to maintain the original format of the image.

This revised version should be free of the bugs present in the original function.
