## Analysis:
1. The `if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA':` condition is checking if the image format is PNG and mode is RGBA.
2. The code converts RGBA images to RGB by creating a new image with a white background and pasting the original image over it.
3. The bug might be in the line `background.paste(image, image)` where the same object `image` is used as both the image to paste and the mask. This might result in unexpected behavior.

## Bug Cause:
The bug arises from using the same image object as both the source image to paste and the mask image. This can lead to unexpected results and image corruption.

## Strategy for fixing the bug:
To fix the bug, we should use separate instances for the source image and the mask image when using the `paste` method. This ensures correct handling of the image conversion process.

## Corrected Version:
```python
# The corrected version of the function
def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
    if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA':
        background = Image.new('RGBA', image.size, (255, 255, 255))
        background.paste(image, (0, 0), image)
        image = background.convert('RGB')
    elif image.mode != 'RGB':
        image = image.convert('RGB')

    if size:
        image = image.copy()
        image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)

    buf = BytesIO()
    image.save(buf, 'JPEG')
    return image, buf
```

In the corrected version, `background.paste(image, (0, 0), image)` is used to properly paste the RGBA image over the white background without using the same image object for both parameters. This ensures the correct conversion of RGBA images to RGB format without data corruption.
