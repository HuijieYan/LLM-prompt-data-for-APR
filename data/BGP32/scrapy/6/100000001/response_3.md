The buggy function `convert_image` has a few potential error locations that could lead to bugs:

1. In the condition `if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA':`, the comparison should be case-insensitive to avoid potential issues due to case differences in image format and mode.
2. The `background.paste(image, image)` call may not paste the image correctly onto the background due to incorrect usage. It should be `background.paste(image, (0, 0), image)`.
3. Converting an image to `'RGB'` without checking if the format is already `'RGB'` may result in unnecessary conversions and quality loss.

The buggy function's bug is potentially caused by not pasting the image onto the background correctly and missing a copy operation when applying the thumbnail.

To fix the bug, we can correct the pasting operation by providing the correct coordinates and add a safeguard to prevent unnecessary conversions when the image is already in RGB format. Additionally, we can ensure that the original image is not modified during thumbnail processing.

Here is the corrected version of the `convert_image` function:

```python
def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
    if image.format.upper() == 'PNG' and image.mode.upper() == 'RGBA':
        background = Image.new('RGBA', image.size, (255, 255, 255))
        background.paste(image, (0, 0), image)
        image = background.convert('RGB')
    elif image.mode.upper() != 'RGB':
        image = image.convert('RGB')

    if size:
        image = image.copy()
        new_image = image.copy()
        new_image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)

    buf = BytesIO()
    new_image.save(buf, 'JPEG')
    return new_image, buf
```

In the corrected version:
- We use `upper()` to make the comparison case-insensitive.
- We correctly paste the image onto the background.
- We ensure that the original image remains intact by creating a new image for thumbnail processing.
- We save the thumbnail image instead of the original image to the buffer.

These adjustments should fix the identified issues in the buggy function.
