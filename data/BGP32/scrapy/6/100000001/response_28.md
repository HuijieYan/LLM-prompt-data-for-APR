## Analysis of the buggy function:
1. The function `convert_image` takes an image as input and converts it to a JPEG format image.
2. There are conditional blocks checking for image format and mode to perform specific conversions.
3. The function saves the converted image to a BytesIO buffer and returns both the image and buffer.

## Identified potential errors:
1. In the line `background.paste(image, image)`, the second argument should be a tuple specifying the area to paste the image onto the background.
2. The check for image.mode may result in converting images that are already in 'RGB' mode unnecessarily.

## Explanation of the bug:
The bug in the function occurs due to the incorrect usage of `paste` method in the line `background.paste(image, image)`, where the second argument should be a tuple specifying the area to paste the image, not the image itself. This leads to a `ValueError` because the second argument is expected to be a tuple, causing the function to fail.

## Strategy for fixing the bug:
To fix the bug, we need to provide correct arguments for the `paste` method. Additionally, to avoid unnecessary conversions, we can optimize the check for image mode before converting the image to 'RGB'.

## Corrected version of the function:
```python
def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
    if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA':
        background = Image.new('RGBA', image.size, (255, 255, 255))
        background.paste(image, (0, 0, image.size[0], image.size[1]))
        image = background.convert('RGB')
    elif image.mode != 'RGB':
        image = image.convert('RGB')

    if size:
        image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)

    buf = BytesIO()
    image.save(buf, 'JPEG')
    return image, buf
```

In the corrected version, the tuple `(0, 0, image.size[0], image.size[1])` is passed as the second argument to the `paste` method, which specifies the entire image area. Additionally, unnecessary conversion is avoided by directly applying `thumbnail` method after the format adjustments.
