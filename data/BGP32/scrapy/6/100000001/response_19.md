The buggy function provided above has a few potential error locations:
1. The condition `if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA':` might not be handling all possible image formats and modes.
2. The line `background.paste(image, image)` in the first if block is problematic as the image itself should not be a parameter for the `paste()` function.
3. There is a possibility of an issue with saving the image in JPEG format regardless of the original format.

The buggy function may produce incorrect results due to the flawed logic in handling image formats and modes. To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the function handles various image formats and modes correctly. Additionally, the paste function should be used with separate image and a bounding box, not the image itself. Lastly, the function should save the image in the original format or the format specified in the function input parameters.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
    if image.mode != 'RGB':
        image = image.convert('RGB')

    if size:
        image = image.copy()
        image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)

    format = image.format if image.format else 'JPEG'
    buf = BytesIO()
    image.save(buf, format)
    return image, buf
```
