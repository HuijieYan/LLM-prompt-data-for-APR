## Analyzing the buggy function:
The buggy function `convert_image` takes an image as input and processes it by converting it to RGB format and resizing it if a specific size is provided. The function is expected to save the processed image as a JPEG file and return the processed image along with a BytesIO buffer.

## Identifying potential error locations:
1. The conditional check for the image format and mode might not effectively handle all cases.
2. The pasting of the image onto a new background might not work as intended.
3. The conversion to RGB format might not cover all scenarios.
4. Errors might occur in resizing the image and saving it as JPEG.

## Explaining the cause of the bug using the buggy function:
The bug in the function could be due to incorrect handling of image format, mode, or the resizing process. The use of `paste` method to put the image on a white background in RGBA format could be problematic. The conversion to RGB might not cover all scenarios, and there could be errors in resizing and saving the image as JPEG.

## Suggesting a strategy for fixing the bug:
1. Ensure proper handling of image format and mode for all cases.
2. Check the image pasting process onto a new background for correctness.
3. Improve the conversion to RGB to cover all scenarios.
4. Validate the resizing of the image and saving it as JPEG.

## Corrected Version of the function:
```python
def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
    if image.mode != 'RGB':
        image = image.convert('RGB')
        
    if size:
        image = image.copy()
        image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)
        
    buf = BytesIO()
    image.save(buf, 'JPEG')
    buf.seek(0)  # Move to the beginning of the buffer for reading
    return image, buf
```

This corrected version of the function addresses the potential issues identified. It ensures that the image is converted to RGB format if it's not already in that format. It resizes the image if a size is specified and saves it as a JPEG format in the buffer. Also, it correctly sets the pointer of the buffer to the beginning for reading.
