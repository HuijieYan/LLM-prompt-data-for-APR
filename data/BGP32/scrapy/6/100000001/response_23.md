## Analyzing the buggy function:
The buggy function `convert_image` is intended to convert images to a specific format and size. However, there are potential errors in the function that need to be addressed.

## Potential error locations:
1. The statement `background.paste(image, image)` may not work as expected, resulting in a potential bug.
2. The line `image.save(buf, 'JPEG')` tries to save the image in JPEG format even if it was originally in PNG format.

## Cause of the bug:
The bug in the function most likely stems from incorrect usage of the `paste` method in the PIL library, which may not be pasting the image correctly. Additionally, saving the image in 'JPEG' format without considering the original format could cause issues.

## Strategy for fixing the bug:
1. Update the `paste` method usage to ensure proper pasting of the image onto the background.
2. Check the original image format to save it in the correct format (PNG to PNG, JPEG to JPEG).

## Corrected version of the function:
```python
def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
    if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA':
        background = Image.new('RGBA', image.size, (255, 255, 255))
        background.paste(image, (0, 0))
        image = background.convert('RGB')
    elif image.mode != 'RGB':
        image = image.convert('RGB')

    if size:
        image = image.copy()
        image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)

    buf = BytesIO()
    image.save(buf, image.format)  # Save in the original format
    return image, buf
```

In the corrected version, the `paste` method is modified to `background.paste(image, (0, 0))` to correctly paste the image onto the background. Additionally, the format used for saving the image is updated to `image.format` to save it in the original format.
