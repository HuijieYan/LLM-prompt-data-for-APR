## Analysis:
The buggy function `convert_image` is designed to convert an image to a specific format and size. The potential error locations within the function include:
1. Incorrect call to `paste()` method in the condition `if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA'`: The `paste()` method should take two arguments - the image to be pasted and the box specifying the region to paste the image. In this case, `image` is being passed twice which is incorrect.
2. Incorrect usage of the `image` variable after conversion: In the case where the image mode is not 'RGB', the image is being converted to 'RGB'. However, the subsequent operations on the image assume that the variable `image` still holds the original image object, which is incorrect.
3. Possible issue with saving the image as JPEG: The function attempts to save the image as JPEG format, but it might not handle all scenarios effectively.

## Bug Explanation:
The cause of the bug in the function lies primarily in the incorrect usage of the `paste()` method in the first conditional block. Due to passing `image` twice to the `paste()` method, the function fails to properly create a background image resulting in the incorrect conversion process. Additionally, the incorrect handling of the image variable after conversion may lead to unexpected behavior.

## Fix Strategy:
1. Correct the call to the `paste()` method to ensure proper pasting of the image onto a new background.
2. Store the converted image in a different variable to avoid confusion and ensure proper handling of the converted image.
3. Ensure proper error handling and robustness when saving the image in the JPEG format.

## Corrected Version:
```python
def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
    if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA':
        background = Image.new('RGBA', image.size, (255, 255, 255))
        background.paste(image)
        image = background.convert('RGB')
    elif image.mode != 'RGB':
        image = image.convert('RGB')

    if size:
        new_image = image.copy() # Store the converted image in a new variable
        new_image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)
    else:
        new_image = image

    buf = BytesIO()
    new_image.save(buf, 'JPEG') # Save the new_image
    return new_image, buf
```

In the corrected version:
- The `paste()` method is called with the correct arguments.
- The converted image is stored in a new variable `new_image` to avoid confusion.
- The saved image is now based on the `new_image` variable.
