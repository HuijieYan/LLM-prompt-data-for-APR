## Analysis:
1. The function takes an image as input and performs operations like format conversion and resizing.
2. Potential error locations:
   a. The condition `if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA':` might be problematic.
   b. The code logic for handling different image modes may not work as intended.
   c. The saving process to JPEG format might cause issues.

## Bug Cause:
The bug could be caused by the incorrect condition check for image format and mode. Converting PNG format and RGBA mode images might not work seamlessly as expected. Additionally, the process of resizing and saving the image to JPEG format may lead to unexpected results.

## Fix Strategy:
1. Modify the condition check for PNG format and RGBA mode to handle the conversion correctly.
2. Ensure proper handling of image modes for format conversion.
3. Adjust the saving process to JPEG format to work flawlessly.

## Corrected Function:
```python
def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
    if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA':
        background = Image.new('RGBA', image.size, (255, 255, 255))
        background.paste(image, (0, 0))
        image = background.convert('RGB')
    elif image.mode != 'RGB':
        image = image.convert('RGB')

    if size:
        image = image.copy()
        image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)

    buf = BytesIO()
    image.save(buf, 'JPEG', quality=95)  # Added quality parameter for JPEG saving
    buf.seek(0)  # Move the cursor back to the beginning of the buffer
    return image, buf
```

In the corrected version:
- Changed `background.paste(image, image)` to `background.paste(image, (0, 0))` to paste the image correctly.
- Added quality parameter (`quality=95`) while saving the image in JPEG format.
- Included `buf.seek(0)` to move the cursor back to the beginning of the buffer before returning.
