The bug in the `convert_image` function is located in the following section of the code:

```python
background.paste(image, image)
```

The bug is caused by using the same image as both the source and the mask in the `paste` method, which results in the paste operation being ineffective.

To fix this bug, we need to provide a different image or a copy of the original image as the mask in the `paste` operation. One approach could be creating a new temporary copy of the original image to ensure the paste operation works correctly.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: scrapy/pipelines/images.py

def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
    if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA':
        background = Image.new('RGBA', image.size, (255, 255, 255))
        background.paste(image, (0, 0), image)
        image = background.convert('RGB')
    elif image.mode != 'RGB':
        image = image.convert('RGB')

    if size:
        image = image.copy()
        image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)

    buf = BytesIO()
    image.save(buf, 'JPEG')
    return image, buf
```

In this corrected version, the `paste` operation replaces `background.paste(image, image)` with `background.paste(image, (0, 0), image)` to indicate that the image should be pasted at the top-left corner of the background. This change ensures that the paste operation works correctly without using the same image as both the source and the mask.
