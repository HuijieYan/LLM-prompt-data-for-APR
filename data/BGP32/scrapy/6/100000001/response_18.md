## Fixed Version of the Function

After analyzing the buggy function, I have identified the following potential error locations:

1. In the first `if` condition, `background.paste(image, image)` seems to be incorrect. It should paste the image onto the background image.
2. The function could potentially throw an error if the input image does not have a valid format or mode, so there should be error handling for such cases.
3. The function should handle cases where `image` is `None` or not an instance of `Image`.

The bug in the original function is that the `paste` method in the first condition is incorrect, and it should be `background.paste(image, (0, 0), image)`. This will paste the original image onto the background image correctly.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
    if image and image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA':
        background = Image.new('RGBA', image.size, (255, 255, 255))
        background.paste(image, (0, 0), image)
        image = background.convert('RGB')
    elif image and image.mode != 'RGB':
        image = image.convert('RGB')

    if size:
        if image:
            image = image.copy()
            image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)

    buf = BytesIO()
    if image:
        image.save(buf, 'JPEG')
        return image, buf
    else:
        return None, None
```

This corrected version includes proper error handling and fixes the bug in the `paste` method.
