The buggy function `convert_image` is intended to take an image and convert it to a JPEG format with an optional resizing parameter. However, there are several potential issues in the function that need to be addressed:

1. Incorrect comparison for image format:
    - The comparison `image.format == 'PNG'` might fail as the format may be in lowercase or uppercase (e.g., 'png' instead of 'PNG'). Therefore, the condition should be checked in a case-insensitive manner.

2. Incorrect handling of RGBA images:
    - When converting RGBA images to RGB, the `background.paste(image, image)` line is pasting the same image on the background, essentially not changing the image. This step should be corrected to paste the original image properly onto the background.
    
4. Inconsistent use of 'RGB' and 'RGBA':
    - There is a mix of conditions and conversions using 'RGB' and 'RGBA' throughout the function. It would be clearer and more consistent to use 'RGBA' where required for transparency support.

5. Memory Buffer Usage:
    - Returning `image, buf` means the image is returned after saving it to the BytesIO buffer. This implies that the image might not have been saved properly to the buffer before returning.

Recommendation for fixing the buggy function:
1. Update the format comparison to a case-insensitive check.
2. Fix the pasting of the RGBA image onto the background.
3. Ensure consistency with color modes 'RGB' and 'RGBA'.
4. Save the image to the BytesIO buffer before returning.


## Corrected Version of the Function
```python
def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
    if image.format.lower() == 'png' and image.mode == 'RGBA':
        background = Image.new('RGBA', image.size, (255, 255, 255))
        background.paste(image, (0, 0), image)
        image = background.convert('RGBA')
    elif image.mode != 'RGB':
        image = image.convert('RGB')

    if size:
        image = image.copy()
        image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)

    buf = BytesIO()
    image.save(buf, format='JPEG')
    buf.seek(0)  # Reset the buffer position to start
    return image, buf
```

By addressing the issues highlighted above, the corrected `convert_image` function should now work properly for converting images to JPEG format with optional resizing capabilities and return both the image and the BytesIO buffer containing the image data.
