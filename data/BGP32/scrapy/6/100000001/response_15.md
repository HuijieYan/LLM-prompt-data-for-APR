## Analysis of the buggy function:
The buggy function `convert_image` is designed to process and convert images. It checks the format and mode of the image, applies conversions if necessary, resizes the image if a size is provided, saves the image as a JPEG format, and returns the image along with its data in BytesIO format.

## Potential error locations:
1. In the condition `if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA'`, the comparison is case-sensitive, which might cause an issue if the format or mode is in a different case.
2. In the condition `elif image.mode != 'RGB'`, the comparison might result in an unwanted conversion even if the image is already in RGB mode.

## Cause of the bug:
The bug in this function may arise due to the following reasons:
- The condition for checking the format and mode of the image is case-sensitive, resulting in incorrect checks.
- The conversion of an image to RGB mode is executed even if the image is already in RGB mode.

## Fixing the bug:
To fix the bug in the function, we need to address the potential error locations and handle them appropriately. For case-sensitive comparisons, we should ensure uniformity by converting all formats and modes to lowercase before comparison. Also, we need to only convert images to RGB mode if they are not already in the RGB mode.

## Corrected version of the function:

```python
def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
    image_format = image.format.upper()
    image_mode = image.mode.upper()

    if image_format == 'PNG' and image_mode == 'RGBA':
        background = Image.new('RGBA', image.size, (255, 255, 255))
        background.paste(image, image)
        image = background.convert('RGB')
    elif image_mode != 'RGB' and image_mode != 'RGBA':
        image = image.convert('RGB')

    if size:
        image = image.copy()
        image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)

    buf = BytesIO()
    image.save(buf, 'JPEG')
    return image, buf
```

In the corrected version of the function, the image format and mode are converted to uppercase for comparison to avoid case-sensitivity issues. Additionally, the conversion to RGB mode only occurs if the image is not already in RGB or RGBA mode.
