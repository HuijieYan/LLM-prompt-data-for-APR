1. Analyzing the buggy function:
The function `convert_image` is supposed to take an image as input and perform some transformations on it, such as converting the image to a different mode and resizing it. The output should be the transformed image and a BytesIO object containing the image data. However, there are potential errors in the logic of the function that need to be addressed.

2. Potential error locations within the buggy function:
a. The condition `if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA':` may not handle all possible image formats or modes correctly.
b. The line `background.paste(image, image)` may not paste the image correctly onto the background.
c. The conversion logic for different image modes might not be correctly implemented.

3. Cause of the bug using the buggy function:
The bug in the function may arise from incorrect handling of image formats and modes during transformations. The conversion logic for RGBA images and other modes might not work as intended, leading to incorrect image processing.

4. Strategy for fixing the bug:
a. Improve the condition for checking image formats and modes to handle different scenarios.
b. Ensure that the image pasting operation onto the background is done correctly.
c. Verify that the conversion logic for different image modes is implemented correctly.

5. Corrected version of the function:

```python
def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
    if image.mode == 'RGBA':
        background = Image.new('RGB', image.size, (255, 255, 255))
        background.paste(image, (0, 0), image)
        image = background
    elif image.mode != 'RGB':
        image = image.convert('RGB')

    if size:
        image = image.copy()
        image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)

    buf = BytesIO()
    image.save(buf, 'JPEG')
    return image, buf
```

In the corrected version:
- Removed the format check and only consider the image mode for transformation.
- Corrected the pasting operation by specifying the position as `(0, 0)` for pasting the image onto the background.
- Updated the conversion logic to handle different image modes correctly.

This improved version of the `convert_image` function should address the potential errors and provide correct image transformations.
