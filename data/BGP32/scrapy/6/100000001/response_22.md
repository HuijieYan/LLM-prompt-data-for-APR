## Analysis:
The buggy function `convert_image()` is designed to convert an image to RGB format and resize it if specified. However, there are potential errors in the function that need to be addressed:
1. In the first if condition, the `background.paste(image, image)` is likely intended to paste the image on the background, but it should be `background.paste(image, (0, 0), image)`.
2. The `image.save(buf, 'JPEG')` line may encounter an issue if the image format is not compatible with JPEG, as the function does not handle this case. 

## Bug Cause:
1. The bug is caused by incorrect usage of the `paste()` method in the PIL library, which is not providing the correct arguments for pasting the image onto the background.
2. Additionally, the function does not handle the scenario where the image format is not compatible with JPEG during saving.

## Bug Fix:
To fix the bug, the `paste()` method in the first condition needs to be corrected, and a check should be added before saving the image in JPEG format to ensure compatibility with the image format.

## Corrected Function:
```python
def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
    if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA':
        background = Image.new('RGBA', image.size, (255, 255, 255))
        background.paste(image, (0, 0), image)
        image = background.convert('RGB')
    elif image.mode != 'RGB':
        image = image.convert('RGB')

    if size:
        image = image.copy()
        image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)

    buf = BytesIO()
    
    # Check if the image format is JPEG-compatible before saving
    if image.format in ('JPEG', 'RGB'):
        image.save(buf, 'JPEG')
    else:
        image.save(buf, image.format)
        
    return image, buf
```

By correcting the paste method and adding a check for JPEG compatibility before saving, the function should now work without the previous bugs.
