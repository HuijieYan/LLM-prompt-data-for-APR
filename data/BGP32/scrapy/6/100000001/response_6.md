### Analyzing the Buggy Function:
The buggy function `convert_image` is supposed to convert an image to a specific format (JPEG) and resize it if a size parameter is provided. However, there are some potential issues in the function that need to be addressed.

### Potential Error Locations:
1. The condition `if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA':` may not correctly check the format and mode of the image.
2. The background paste operation `background.paste(image, image)` may not be pasting the image correctly.
3. The conversion operations at the beginning of the function may not handle all cases properly.
4. The saving of the image as JPEG may require additional parameters to ensure quality and optimization.

### Explanation of the Bug:
The bug in the original function stems from potential issues in detecting the format and mode of the image, pasting the background, and converting the image correctly. These issues can lead to incorrect conversions and unexpected behavior when handling different image formats and modes.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
1. Ensure that the format and mode detection is accurate.
2. Check the paste operation to correctly mix the background with the image.
3. Improve the conversion logic for different image formats and modes.
4. Use appropriate parameters when saving the image as JPEG for better quality results.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
    if image.mode != 'RGB':
        image = image.convert('RGB')

    if size:
        image = image.copy()
        image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)

    buf = BytesIO()
    image.save(buf, 'JPEG', quality=90)  # Added quality parameter for better JPEG saving
    return image, buf
```

### Changes Made in the Corrected Version:
1. Removed the incorrect format and mode checking conditions.
2. Removed unnecessary background paste operation.
3. Simplified the conversion logic to ensure images are converted to RGB.
4. Added a quality parameter when saving the image as JPEG for better quality output.
