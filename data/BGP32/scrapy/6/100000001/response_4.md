## Analysis:
The buggy function `convert_image` is responsible for converting an image to JPEG format with optional resizing. The function first checks if the image format is PNG and mode is RGBA, in which case it converts the image to RGB format. Then, it checks if the image mode is not RGB and converts it to RGB if needed. Finally, if a size is provided, it resizes the image using the thumbnail method. The function then saves the image in JPEG format and returns the image object and the BytesIO buffer containing the image data.

## Bug Identification:
1. The `background.paste(image, image)` line in the `if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA':` block is incorrect. It should be `background.paste(image, (0, 0), image)`.
2. The `image.save(buf, 'JPEG')` line doesn't consider the format of the input image. It should save the image in the same format as the input image.
3. The function does not handle the case where the image format is not 'PNG', but the mode is 'RGBA'. In this case, it should convert the image to RGB format.

## Bug Cause:
1. The incorrect usage of `background.paste` method is causing the image to be pasted incorrectly over the created background.
2. Not considering the input image format when saving causes the output image to always be saved in JPEG format.
3. The function lacks handling for the case where the input image is not PNG format but has RGBA mode.

## Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Fix the `background.paste` method usage with correct arguments.
2. Save the image in the same format as the input image.
3. Add a condition to handle the case when the image format is not 'PNG', but the mode is 'RGBA'.

## Corrected Version:
```python
from PIL import Image
from io import BytesIO

def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
    if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA':
        background = Image.new('RGBA', image.size, (255, 255, 255))
        background.paste(image, (0, 0), image)
        image = background.convert('RGB')
    elif image.mode == 'RGBA':
        image = image.convert('RGB')

    if size:
        image = image.copy()
        image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)

    buf = BytesIO()
    image.save(buf, image.format)
    return image, buf
```

In the corrected version:
- `background.paste(image, (0, 0), image)` is used to correctly paste the image on the background.
- The image is saved in the same format as the input image by using `image.format`.
- Added a condition to handle the case when the image format is not 'PNG', but the mode is 'RGBA'.
