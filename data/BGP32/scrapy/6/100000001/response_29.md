## Analysis:
1. The `if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA':` condition is checking for a PNG format image with RGBA mode, but the condition is problematic as it misses the case where the mode might be 'RGB'.
2. In the `background.paste(image, image)` line, the paste function is being used incorrectly, which could result in an error.
3. The image is being saved as JPEG format regardless of its original format, which can cause issues with the output image.

## Bug Cause:
The bug occurs due to incorrect handling of images with RGB mode, incorrect usage of the `paste` function, and saving images as JPEG regardless of their original format.

## Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
1. Update the condition to handle images with RGB mode appropriately.
2. Use the `background.paste()` function correctly.
3. Save the image in its original format instead of forcing it to JPEG.

## Corrected Version:
```python
from PIL import Image
from io import BytesIO

def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
    if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA':
        background = Image.new('RGBA', image.size, (255, 255, 255))
        background.paste(image, (0, 0), image)
        image = background.convert('RGB')
    elif image.mode != 'RGB':
        image = image.convert('RGB')

    if size:
        image = image.copy()
        image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)

    buf = BytesIO()
    image.save(buf, image.format)
    return image, buf
```

In the corrected version, the use of `background.paste()` has been updated to include the coordinates `(0, 0)` and the image itself to prevent any issues. Additionally, the image is saved in its original format instead of hardcoding it to JPEG.
