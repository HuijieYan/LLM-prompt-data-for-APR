### Analysis
The buggy function `convert_image` is responsible for converting images to a specific format. It has conditional logic to handle different scenarios based on the image format and mode. The failing test is due to incorrect conversion of images with RGBA mode and PNG format. The function is not handling transparency correctly for PNG images with RGBA mode.

### Bug Explanation
The bug occurs when the function encounters an image with PNG format and RGBA mode. In this case, the function creates a new image with RGBA mode and pastes the original image onto it. However, the correction should involve pasting the original image onto the background image without losing the transparency. This results in incorrect color values being compared in the failing test because transparency is not correctly handled.

### Bug Fix
To fix the bug, we need to adjust the logic for handling RGBA images in PNG format. We should create a new RGBA image for transparency, paste the original image onto it, and then convert it to RGB mode. This will preserve the transparency of the original image.

### Corrected Function
```python
from PIL import Image
from cStringIO import StringIO as BytesIO

class ImagesPipeline(FilesPipeline):
    def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
        if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA':
            background = Image.new('RGBA', image.size, (255, 255, 255, 255))  # Create RGBA background
            background.paste(image, (0, 0), image)  # Paste original image onto background
            image = background.convert('RGB')  # Convert the combined image to RGB
        elif image.mode != 'RGB':
            image = image.convert('RGB')
        
        if size:
            image = image.copy()
            image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)
        
        buf = BytesIO()
        image.save(buf, 'JPEG')
        return image, buf
```

By making the suggested changes to the `convert_image` function, the bug should be fixed, and the failing test cases should pass as expected.
