### Bug Explanation
The bug occurs because the `convert_image` function in the `ImagesPipeline` class does not correctly handle transparency when converting images. 

When the input image is in PNG format and has RGBA mode, the function creates a new image (`background`) with RGBA mode and pastes the input image onto it. Then, it converts this new image to RGB mode. This conversion removes the alpha channel, which leads to a loss of transparency information and incorrect colors in the output image.

### Bug Fix
To fix the bug, we need to handle transparency correctly when converting images. We can check if the image has an alpha channel (transparency) and preserve it during the conversion. Additionally, we need to make sure that the image mode is converted to RGB when needed, without losing transparency information.

Here is the corrected version of the `convert_image` function:

```python
def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
    if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA':
        # Check if image has transparency
        if 'A' in image.getbands():
            image = image.convert('RGBA')  # Ensure the image is in RGBA mode
            background = Image.new('RGBA', image.size, (255, 255, 255, 255))
            background.paste(image, image)
        else:
            image = image.convert('RGB')  # Convert to RGB mode without losing transparency
    elif image.mode != 'RGB':
        image = image.convert('RGB')

    if size:
        image = image.copy()
        image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)

    buf = BytesIO()
    image.save(buf, 'JPEG')
    return image, buf
```

This corrected version checks for the presence of an alpha channel in the input image and handles transparency properly during the conversion process. This fix ensures that the converted images maintain their transparency when needed.
