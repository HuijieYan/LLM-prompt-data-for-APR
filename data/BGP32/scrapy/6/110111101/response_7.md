### Analysis
The buggy function `convert_image` is intended to handle image conversions and thumbnail creation. The bug arises from the incorrect handling of transparency in PNG images. The function is expected to convert PNG RGBA images to RGB while maintaining the appropriate colors. However, the current implementation results in incorrect output values, leading to failing tests.

### Identified Bug
The bug occurs in the section where the function checks for PNG format and RGBA mode. When converting such images, the code creates a new background image, pastes the original image over it, and then converts the whole background image to RGB. This approach does not properly handle transparency, resulting in incorrect color values in the converted image.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to handle PNG RGBA images differently to preserve transparency and color accuracy during conversion. Instead of creating a white background, pasting the original image, and then converting, we should directly convert the RGBA image to RGB, ensuring that the colors are maintained correctly. This adjustment will align with the expected behavior specified in the failing tests.

### Corrected Version of the Function
```python
class ImagesPipeline(FilesPipeline):
    def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
        if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA':
            image = image.convert('RGB')
        elif image.mode != 'RGB':
            image = image.convert('RGB')
    
        if size:
            image = image.copy()
            image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)
    
        buf = BytesIO()
        image.save(buf, 'JPEG')
        return image, buf
```

By directly converting PNG RGBA images to RGB mode without creating a solid background, the corrected function properly handles transparency and color integrity during image conversion. This adjusted implementation should pass the failing tests and produce the expected output values.
