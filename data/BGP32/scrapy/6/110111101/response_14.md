## Bug Analysis
### Buggy Function
The `convert_image` function in the `ImagesPipeline` class is responsible for converting images to the desired format and size. However, there are issues related to handling RGBA images with a PNG format.

### Error Location
The bug occurs when handling RGBA images with the PNG format. The function attempts to convert the image to RGB format, but the conversion logic is incorrect.

### Bug Cause
1. When the image format is PNG and mode is RGBA, a new background image is created with a white color (RGB) and the original image is pasted onto it. Then, the image is converted to RGB format. This process leads to a loss of transparency, potentially causing issues with the conversion of RGBA images to RGB.
2. When the mode of the image is not RGB, the image is converted to RGB format, but this conversion may not maintain the integrity of the information required for transparency.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug:
1. Preserve transparency when converting RGBA images to RGB by using a method that handles alpha channels appropriately.
2. Ensure that conversion to RGB format does not affect transparency when the initial mode is not RGB.

### Corrected Function
```python
from PIL import Image
from io import BytesIO

class ImagesPipeline(FilesPipeline):
    def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
        if image.mode == 'RGBA':
            image = image.convert('RGBA')
        else:
            image = image.convert('RGB')

        if size:
            image = image.copy()
            image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)

        buf = BytesIO()
        image.save(buf, 'JPEG')
        
        return image, buf
```

The corrected function handles the conversion of images by explicitly converting RGBA images to RGBA (preserving transparency) and ensures that RGB images are still converted to RGB. This fix addresses the transparency issue that was causing the failing test.
