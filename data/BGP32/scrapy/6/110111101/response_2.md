### Analysis
The bug in the `convert_image` function lies in the conditional logic for handling different image formats and modes. The function attempts to handle PNG images with RGBA mode by converting them to RGB, which alters the transparency information of the image. This leads to discrepancies in the test cases that expect specific colors or modes in the output.

### Bug Cause
The bug occurs due to incorrect handling of PNG images with RGBA mode in the `convert_image` function. When a PNG image with RGBA mode is encountered, it should be converted to RGB while preserving the transparency information.

### Fix Strategy
1. Check the image format and mode.
2. If the image format is 'PNG' and mode is 'RGBA', handle the conversion to RGB while maintaining transparency.
3. If the image mode is not 'RGB', convert the image to RGB.
4. Ensure that other operations like thumbnail creation are applied correctly.

### Updated Code
```python
def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
    if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA':
        background = Image.new('RGB', image.size, (255, 255, 255))
        background.paste(image, (0, 0), image)
        image = background
    elif image.mode != 'RGB':
        image = image.convert('RGB')

    if size:
        image = image.copy()
        image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)

    buf = BytesIO()
    image.save(buf, 'JPEG')
    return image, buf
``` 

By modifying the `convert_image` function as demonstrated above, the bug related to transparency issues with PNG images in RGBA mode should be resolved.
