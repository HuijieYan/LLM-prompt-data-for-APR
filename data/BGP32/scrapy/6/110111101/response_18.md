### Bug Explanation
The bug in the `convert_image` function lies in the conditional block where the image format is 'PNG' and the mode is 'RGBA'. In this case, the function erroneously creates a new background image of mode 'RGBA' and then pastes the original image onto this background, converting the result to 'RGB'. This conversion results in losing the alpha channel information, leading to incorrect color values in the image.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to handle RGBA images differently to preserve the alpha channel information during the conversion process. One common approach is to separate the alpha channel from the image and then merge it back after the conversion.

### The Corrected Function
```python
def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
    if image.mode == 'RGBA':
        alpha = image.getchannel('A')
        image = image.convert('RGB')
        image.putalpha(alpha)

    if size:
        image = image.copy()
        image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)

    buf = BytesIO()
    image.save(buf, 'JPEG')
    return image, buf
``` 

By making these changes, the corrected function properly handles RGBA images by preserving the alpha channel information during conversion, addressing the bug identified in the failing test cases.
