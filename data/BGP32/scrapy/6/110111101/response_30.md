### Bug Analysis
The bug in the `convert_image` function lies in the condition where it handles PNG images with RGBA mode. The issue comes from the line `background.paste(image, image)` which pastes the image on top of itself. This will result in preserving transparency as opposed to filling with a white background. 

The failing test is for converting an RGBA PNG image to RGB, and it expects the background to be white when transparency is present. Therefore, the bug causes the background color to retain the transparency values rather than turning into a white background.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to change how the background is filled for PNG images with RGBA mode. Instead of pasting the image on itself, we should paste it on the new white background to remove the transparency.

### Updated Function
Here is the corrected version of the `convert_image` function:

```python
def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
    if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA':
        background = Image.new('RGBA', image.size, (255, 255, 255, 255))
        background.paste(image, (0, 0), image)
        image = background.convert('RGB')
    elif image.mode != 'RGB':
        image = image.convert('RGB')

    if size:
        image = image.copy()
        image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)

    buf = BytesIO()
    image.save(buf, 'JPEG')
    return image, buf
```

This corrected version handles PNG images with RGBA mode correctly by pasting them on a white background before converting to RGB. This change ensures that the background is filled with white color when converting transparent images.
