### Explanation
The bug in the `convert_image` function is in the conditional block that checks if the image format is `'PNG'` and the mode is `'RGBA'`. In this block, a new background image is created with white color, and then the original image is pasted onto the background, expectedly creating a white background for the transparent image. However, during pasting, the mistake is in using the same image variable for both the background and pasting operations. This leads to incorrect results in later processing.

### Error Cause
The bug occurs because the original image is incorrectly pasted onto itself, resulting in an incorrect conversion process for RGBA images to RGB.

### Fix Strategy
To fix this bug, it is crucial to create a separate image variable to hold the background image when the format is `'PNG'` and the mode is `'RGBA'. This way, maintaining the original image unchanged for the subsequent thumbnail processing ensures correct conversion.

### Corrected Version
```python
def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
    if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA':
        background = Image.new('RGBA', image.size, (255, 255, 255))
        background.paste(image, (0, 0), image)
        image = background.convert('RGB')
    elif image.mode != 'RGB':
        image = image.convert('RGB')

    if size:
        image_copy = image.copy()
        image_copy.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)

        buf = BytesIO()
        image_copy.save(buf, 'JPEG')
        return image_copy, buf
    else:
        buf = BytesIO()
        image.save(buf, 'JPEG')
        return image, buf
``` 

By making these changes, the corrected `convert_image` function should now process the image correctly, passing all the failing test cases.
