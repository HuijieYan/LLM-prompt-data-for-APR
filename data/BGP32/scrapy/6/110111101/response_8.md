### Bug Explanation
The bug in the `convert_image` function arises from the incorrect use of the `paste` method. The buggy code snippet attempts to paste the image onto a new background image using the `paste` method. However, the correct usage is to provide a tuple with the coordinates to paste the image, not the image itself.

In the buggy code:
```python
background.paste(image, image)
```
The `paste` method expects an `(x, y)` tuple coordinates to specify where to place the image `image` on the `background`. Instead of an image object, the coordinates are passed twice, causing an incorrect operation and leading to unexpected results.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to correct the call to the `paste` method by providing the correct `(x, y)` tuple to specify the location for pasting the image onto the background.

### Corrected Version of the Function
```python
def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
    if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA':
        background = Image.new('RGBA', image.size, (255, 255, 255))
        background.paste(image, (0, 0))  # Correct the paste call
        image = background.convert('RGB')
    elif image.mode != 'RGB':
        image = image.convert('RGB')

    if size:
        image = image.copy()
        image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)

    buf = BytesIO()
    image.save(buf, 'JPEG')
    return image, buf
```

By correcting the `paste` method call, we ensure that the image is pasted onto the background at the correct location, addressing the bug in the function.
