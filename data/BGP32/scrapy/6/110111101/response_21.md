### Bug Explanation
The bug in the `convert_image` function arises from incorrect handling of images with transparency (alpha channel) in the PNG format. The function attempts to handle PNG images with RGBA mode by converting them to RGB but fails to properly account for the transparency values.

Specifically, when handling PNG images with RGBA mode, the function creates a new image with a white background using the `Image.new` method. It then attempts to paste the original image onto this white background using the `paste` method. However, the correct way to handle the transparency values is to pass the original image as the mask parameter when pasting. Failing to do this results in the loss of transparency information during the paste operation, leading to incorrect color values in the final image.

### Proposed Fix
To fix the bug, we need to modify the section of the code that handles PNG images with RGBA mode. Instead of just pasting the image onto a white background, we should provide the original image as the mask parameter in the `paste` method. This way, the transparency values will be preserved when creating the new image.

```python
def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
    if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA':
        background = Image.new('RGBA', image.size, (255, 255, 255, 255))
        background.paste(image, (0, 0), image)
        image = background.convert('RGB')
    elif image.mode != 'RGB':
        image = image.convert('RGB')

    if size:
        image = image.copy()
        image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)

    buf = BytesIO()
    image.save(buf, 'JPEG')
    return image, buf
```

With this modification, the function should now correctly handle PNG images with transparency, maintaining the alpha channel information during the conversion process. This fix should make the failing test cases pass as the transparency values will be preserved in the final RGB image.
