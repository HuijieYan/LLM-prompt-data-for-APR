### Bug Explanation
The bug in the `convert_image` function arises from the incorrect pasting of the original image onto a background in the RGBA to RGB conversion case. When the image format is PNG and the mode is RGBA, the function creates a new RGBA background image and then pastes the original RGBA image onto it. However, the correct method is to paste the image onto the background with a mask parameter. Since the mask is missing, this results in an incorrect conversion of the image.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to modify the code where the image is pasted onto the background to include a mask parameter. By adding the mask parameter correctly, the RGBA image will be converted to RGB as expected.

### Corrected Version of the Function
```python
def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
    if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA':
        background = Image.new('RGB', image.size, (255, 255, 255))
        background.paste(image, (0, 0), image)
        image = background
    elif image.mode != 'RGB':
        image = image.convert('RGB')

    if size:
        image = image.copy()
        image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)

    buf = BytesIO()
    image.save(buf, 'JPEG')
    return image, buf
``` 

By fixing the image pasting operation and ensuring the correct conversion of RGBA images to RGB, the corrected function should now pass the failing test cases and produce the expected outputs.
