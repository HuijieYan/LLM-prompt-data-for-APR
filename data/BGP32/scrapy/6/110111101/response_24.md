### Bug Analysis:
The bug in the `convert_image` function occurs when handling PNG images with RGBA mode. The function attempts to convert the PNG image to RGB mode, but in doing so, it fills the transparent areas with a white background. This leads to a mismatch in the color values during the comparison, causing the test cases to fail.

The bug arises from the way the RGBA image is pasted onto the white background. The incorrect line is `background.paste(image, image)`, which is pasting the RGBA image onto itself, leading to opacity loss in the resulting RGB image.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to correct the way the RGBA image is converted to RGB mode. Instead of pasting the image onto itself, we need to create a copy of the RGBA image and then paste it onto the white background.

### Corrected Version of the `convert_image` Function:
```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: scrapy/pipelines/images.py

# The declaration of the class containing the buggy function
class ImagesPipeline(FilesPipeline):
    """
    Abstract pipeline that implement the image thumbnail generation logic
    """

    # Corrected version of the buggy function
    def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
        if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA':
            background = Image.new('RGBA', image.size, (255, 255, 255))
            background.paste(image, (0, 0), image)
            image = background.convert('RGB')
        elif image.mode != 'RGB':
            image = image.convert('RGB')
    
        if size:
            image = image.copy()
            image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)
    
        buf = BytesIO()
        image.save(buf, 'JPEG')
        return image, buf
```

By making this adjustment in the `convert_image` function, the RGBA image will be correctly pasted onto the white background before converting it to RGB mode. This fix should resolve the issues with the failing test cases and ensure that the function behaves as expected.
