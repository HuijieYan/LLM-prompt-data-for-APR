### Bug Analysis
The buggy function `convert_image` in the `ImagesPipeline` class is supposed to convert images to RGB mode and perform thumbnail generation if specified. However, there are two main issues:
1. When the image format is 'PNG' and the mode is 'RGBA', the function incorrectly pastes the image onto a white background using `background.paste(image, image)` which results in transparency artifacts being blended in. Instead, it should just create a white background image of the same size as the original image and then paste the original image on top without blending.
2. The function always saves the image in JPEG format, regardless of its original format. This causes issues with transparency and can lead to incorrect color channel representation.

### Bug Fix Strategy
1. Modify the logic for creating a background for PNG images with RGBA mode to prevent blending issues.
2. Update the function to save the image in the input format rather than hardcoding it to JPEG.

### Corrected Implementation
```python
class ImagesPipeline(FilesPipeline):
    """
    Abstract pipeline that implements the image thumbnail generation logic
    """

    def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
        if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA':
            background = Image.new('RGB', image.size, (255, 255, 255))
            background.paste(image, (0, 0, image.size[0], image.size[1]), image)
            image = background
        elif image.mode != 'RGB':
            image = image.convert('RGB')

        if size:
            image = image.copy()
            image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)

        buf = BytesIO()
        image.save(buf, format=image.format)
        return image, buf
```

By implementing the improved logic in the corrected function, specifically in handling PNG images with RGBA mode and correctly saving images based on their original format, the function should now pass the failing test cases.
