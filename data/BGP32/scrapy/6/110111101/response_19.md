### Bug Explanation:
The bug in the `convert_image` function lies in the condition where it converts an RGBA image in PNG format to RGB format. When converting the RGBA image to RGB, it pastes the RGBA image on to a new white background and then converts the resulting image to RGB. However, the issue is that when pasting the RGBA image on the white background, it changes the transparency values, resulting in color changes in the final RGB image. This color change leads to failing tests, indicating that the converted image does not match the expected output.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, the function should first check if the input image is in RGBA mode before making any conversions. If it's in RGBA mode, it should separate the alpha channel before pasting it onto the new background, ensuring that the transparency information is preserved during the conversion process.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
    if image.mode == 'RGBA':
        background = Image.new('RGB', image.size, (255, 255, 255))
        background.paste(image, mask=image.split()[3])  # Use the alpha channel as the mask
        image = background
    elif image.mode != 'RGB':
        image = image.convert('RGB')
    
    if size:
        image = image.copy()
        image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)
    
    buf = BytesIO()
    image.save(buf, 'JPEG')
    return image, buf
```

By incorporating the changes outlined above, the corrected version of the function should now preserve the transparency of RGBA images during conversion, ensuring that the output matches the expected values and passes all test cases.
