### Analysis
The buggy function is intended to convert images to RGB format and optionally resize them. In the provided cases, there are issues with handling images in RGBA and P modes that result in incorrect conversions. Specifically, the function fails to handle images in RGBA format correctly.

### Bug Explanation
- In Case 3, when the input image is in PNG format and RGBA mode, the function attempts to convert it to RGB by creating a new RGBA background and pasting the original image onto it. The bug lies in the line `background.paste(image, image)`, where the paste call uses the image itself as the second argument instead of pasting the image's content.
- In Case 4, when the input image is initially in P mode (palette mode), the function converts it to RGB without considering the color attributes, leading to potential color distortion.

### Bug Fix Strategy
- Modify the logic to correctly handle images in RGBA format by pasting the original image content onto the new background in Case 3.
- Ensure that images in palette mode (P mode) are converted to RGB properly in Case 4, preserving the color attributes.

### Corrected Version of the Function
```python
def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
    if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA':
        background = Image.new('RGBA', image.size, (255, 255, 255))
        background.paste(image, (0, 0), image)
        image = background.convert('RGB')
    elif image.mode != 'RGB':
        image = image.convert('RGB')

    if size:
        image = image.copy()
        image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)

    buf = BytesIO()
    image.save(buf, 'JPEG')
    return image, buf
```

By following this corrected implementation, the buggy function should be able to handle RGBA and P mode images correctly, passing the failing tests.
