### Bug Analysis:
The buggy function `convert_image` has a few issues that need to be addressed:
1. If the input image has format 'PNG' and mode 'RGBA', it attempts to convert it to 'RGB' by creating a new image with a white background and pasting the original image on top. However, the `paste` method expects a box tuple rather than the original image itself.
2. In the case where the image mode is not 'RGB', it correctly converts it to 'RGB', but it does not handle the case where the image is in RGBA mode but with JPEG format.
3. While saving the image as JPEG, it does not set the quality parameter for the output image.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Ensure that the image is pasted correctly to the background if the format is 'PNG' and mode is 'RGBA'.
2. Handle the case where the image is in 'RGBA' mode but with JPEG format by converting it to 'RGB' without pasting it on a background image.
3. Specify the quality parameter while saving the image as JPEG to ensure consistent output.

### Bug-Free Version of the Function:
```python
from PIL import Image
from io import BytesIO

def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
    if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA':
        background = Image.new('RGBA', image.size, (255, 255, 255))
        background.paste(image, (0, 0), image)
        image = background.convert('RGB')
    elif image.mode != 'RGB':
        image = image.convert('RGB')

    if size:
        image = image.copy()
        image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)

    buf = BytesIO()
    image.save(buf, 'JPEG', quality=95)  # Set quality parameter for JPEG
    return image, buf
```

This version of the function addresses the bugs by correctly pasting the image onto the background, handling the case of 'RGBA' with JPEG format, and setting the quality parameter when saving as JPEG.
