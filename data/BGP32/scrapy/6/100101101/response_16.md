## Bug Explanation

The bug in the provided code lies in the conditional check for the image format and mode. Specifically, the condition `if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA':` is intended to handle the case of PNG images with RGBA mode, but the subsequent logic inside this condition is incorrect. It creates a new RGBA background image filled with white color, pastes the original image onto this background, and then converts it to RGB. This approach does not effectively handle the transparency of the original RGBA image. The bug results in incorrect conversion and image processing for PNG images with RGBA mode.

## Bug Fix Strategy

To fix the bug, the handling of PNG images with RGBA mode needs to be corrected. Instead of creating a new background image filled with white color, the alpha channel of the original RGBA image should be preserved during the conversion to RGB. This can be achieved by converting the RGBA image to RGB while preserving the alpha channel information.

## Corrected Function

Here is the corrected version of the `convert_image` function:

```python
def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
    if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA':
        image = image.convert('RGB')
    elif image.mode != 'RGB':
        image = image.convert('RGB')

    if size:
        image = image.copy()
        image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)

    buf = BytesIO()
    image.save(buf, 'JPEG')
    return image, buf
```

With this correction, the function will properly handle the conversion of PNG images with RGBA mode by preserving the alpha channel information and producing the expected output for the failing test cases.
