## Bug Explanation
The bug occurs in the `convert_image` function when handling PNG images with RGBA mode. The function attempts to convert the image to RGB by creating a new RGBA background image filled with white and then pasting the original image onto it. However, the paste operation is incorrect, causing the transparency to be lost in the resulting RGB image.

## Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to adjust how the original image is pasted onto the new background image. Specifically, we need to use the `RGBA` mode when pasting the image to preserve its transparency.

## Corrected Version of the Function
```python
def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
    if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA':
        background = Image.new('RGBA', image.size, (255, 255, 255, 255))
        background.paste(image, (0, 0), image)
        image = background.convert('RGB')
    elif image.mode != 'RGB':
        image = image.convert('RGB')

    if size:
        image = image.copy()
        image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)

    buf = BytesIO()
    image.save(buf, 'JPEG')
    return image, buf
``` 

By updating the paste operation in the PNG RGBA case to `background.paste(image, (0, 0), image)`, we ensure that the transparency is preserved when converting the image to RGB. This corrected version should now pass the failing test cases.
