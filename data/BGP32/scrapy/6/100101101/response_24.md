## Bug Explanation
The bug in the `convert_image` function lies in the condition to check if the image format is `'PNG'` and mode is `'RGBA'`. If both conditions are met, the function attempts to convert the image to RGB by creating a new image with a white background and pasting the original image onto it. However, the `paste` method call is incorrect as it should specify the position as a tuple, not the image itself.

## Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug in the `convert_image` function, we need to change the line `background.paste(image, image)` to `background.paste(image, (0, 0), image)`. This modification ensures that the `paste` method is correctly called with the paste position tuple.

## Corrected Version of the Function
```python
def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
    if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA':
        background = Image.new('RGBA', image.size, (255, 255, 255))
        background.paste(image, (0, 0), image)
        image = background.convert('RGB')
    elif image.mode != 'RGB':
        image = image.convert('RGB')

    if size:
        image = image.copy()
        image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)

    buf = BytesIO()
    image.save(buf, 'JPEG')
    return image, buf
``` 

By making this adjustment, the function should now correctly handle images with PNG format and RGBA mode, resolving the bug and passing the failing test cases.
