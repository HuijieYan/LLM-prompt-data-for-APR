### Bug Explanation
The bug in the `convert_image` function occurs when the input image is in PNG format and RGBA mode. In this case, the code attempts to create a new image with a white background and paste the original image onto it. However, the `paste` method is called incorrectly causing the original image not to be pasted onto the new background correctly. This leads to an incorrect conversion when saving the image as JPEG.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix this bug, we need to correct the way the original image is pasted onto the new background when the input image is in PNG format and RGBA mode. By using the correct method to paste the image onto the background, we can ensure that the image conversion is done correctly.

### Corrected Version of the Function
```python
def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
    if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA':
        background = Image.new('RGBA', image.size, (255, 255, 255, 255))
        background.paste(image, (0, 0), image)
        image = background.convert('RGB')
    elif image.mode != 'RGB':
        image = image.convert('RGB')

    if size:
        image = image.copy()
        image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)

    buf = BytesIO()
    image.save(buf, 'JPEG')
    return image, buf
```

By correcting the pasting method for the RGBA image onto the new background, the function should now correctly handle PNG images with an RGBA mode and convert them to RGB before saving as JPEG. This correction should result in passing the failing test cases provided.
