### Identified Bug
The bug in the `convert_image` function is in the condition where it checks if the input image's format is PNG and mode is RGBA. In this case, it creates a new image `background` with a white background and pastes the original image onto it. However, when pasting the original image onto the white background, the correct method would be `background.paste(image, (0, 0), image)`, but it is currently set to `background.paste(image, image)`, resulting in the bug where the image is not pasted correctly onto the white background.

### Bug Explanation
1. In Case 3, where the input image format is PNG and the mode is RGBA, the function incorrectly assumes that the line `background.paste(image, image)` pastes the image correctly onto the white background. Due to this incorrect method call, the alpha values of the original RGBA image are not respected, resulting in an incorrect conversion.

### Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, the correct way to paste the original image onto the white background is by providing the paste coordinates as `(0, 0)` and providing the original image as the mask image parameter. This way, the correct alpha values are respected when pasting the RGBA image onto the white background.

### Corrected Function
Here is the corrected version of the `convert_image` function:

```python
def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
    if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA':
        background = Image.new('RGBA', image.size, (255, 255, 255))
        background.paste(image, (0, 0), image)
        image = background.convert('RGB')
    elif image.mode != 'RGB':
        image = image.convert('RGB')

    if size:
        image = image.copy()
        image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)

    buf = BytesIO()
    image.save(buf, 'JPEG')
    return image, buf
```

By making this correction in the `convert_image` function, it should now correctly handle pasting the RGBA image onto the white background, respecting the alpha values and producing the expected results for the failing test cases.
