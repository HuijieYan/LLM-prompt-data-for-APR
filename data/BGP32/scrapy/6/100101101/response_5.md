The bug in the provided function `convert_image` lies in the condition checking for PNG format and RGBA mode. When the image is in PNG format and RGBA mode, the function creates a new image with RGBA background, pastes the original image on the background, and converts it to RGB. However, the `paste` method requires a tuple (x, y) as the second argument to specify the position to paste the image, but mistakenly the function is passing the entire image object as the position.

To fix the bug, we should correct the way the paste method is being called to paste the original image correctly onto the background. Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
# The corrected version of the function
def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
    if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA':
        background = Image.new('RGBA', image.size, (255, 255, 255))
        background.paste(image, (0, 0))  # Corrected the paste method call
        image = background.convert('RGB')
    elif image.mode != 'RGB':
        image = image.convert('RGB')

    if size:
        image = image.copy()
        image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)

    buf = BytesIO()
    image.save(buf, 'JPEG')
    return image, buf
```

With this correction, the function should now correctly handle images in PNG format with RGBA mode and pass the failing test cases provided.
