### Identification of the Bug
The bug in the `convert_image` function lies in the conditional statements that handle the conversion of images based on their format and mode. Specifically, the bug occurs when dealing with PNG images in RGBA mode. The function mistakenly converts RGBA PNG images to RGB without properly handling the transparency channel, resulting in incorrect conversions.

### Bug Explanation
- In Case 3, the input image is a PNG image in RGBA mode with partial transparency.
- The buggy function incorrectly converts the RGBA PNG image to RGB by directly discarding the transparency information, leading to a loss of image data.
- This results in the converted image losing its original RGBA composition, affecting the color representation and failing the test assertions.

### Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to modify the conditional block that processes PNG images in RGBA mode. We should ensure the conversion properly handles the transparency channel to maintain the integrity of the image data. By updating the conversion logic for RGBA PNG images, we can preserve the transparency information during the conversion process.

### Corrected Version of the Function
```python
def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
    if image.mode == 'RGBA':
        image = image.convert('RGBA')  # Ensuring image is in RGBA mode
        
        if image.format == 'PNG':
            background = Image.new('RGBA', image.size, (255, 255, 255, 255))
            background.paste(image, (0, 0), image)
            image = background.convert('RGB')

    elif image.mode != 'RGB':
        image = image.convert('RGB')

    if size:
        image = image.copy()
        image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)

    buf = BytesIO()
    image.save(buf, 'JPEG')
    return image, buf
```

By updating the conversion logic as shown above, we ensure that RGBA PNG images are handled correctly, preserving their transparency while converting them to RGB. This corrected version should pass the failing test cases and maintain the expected input/output values.
