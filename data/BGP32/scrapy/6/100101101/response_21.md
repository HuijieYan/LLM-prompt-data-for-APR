## Bug Analysis
The buggy function `convert_image` is intended to convert images to a specific format and size. However, there are a few issues causing it to fail the provided test cases.

1. In the first `if` condition, the check for PNG format and RGBA mode uses incorrect capitalization ('PNG' and 'RGBA') which may result in the condition failing. This can lead to incorrect conversion logic being applied.
2. In the first `if` condition where the conversion logic is applied, the `background.paste(image, image)` line seems incorrect as it pastes the image on itself, potentially causing unexpected results.
3. There is inconsistency in handling the mode conversion in different conditions that might lead to incorrect output.

## Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug in the `convert_image` function, the following changes need to be implemented:
1. Correct the capitalization in the condition check for PNG format and RGBA mode.
2. Update the logic inside the `if` condition to correctly create a new background image and paste the original image onto it.
3. Ensure uniform handling of mode conversion for all input cases.

## The corrected version of the function
```python
def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
    if image.format.upper() == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA':
        background = Image.new('RGBA', image.size, (255, 255, 255))
        background.paste(image, (0, 0), image)
        image = background.convert('RGB')
    elif image.mode != 'RGB':
        image = image.convert('RGB')

    if size:
        image = image.copy()
        image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)

    buf = BytesIO()
    image.save(buf, 'JPEG')
    return image, buf

```

By implementing these fixes, the `convert_image` function should now handle image conversions correctly and pass the provided failing test cases.
