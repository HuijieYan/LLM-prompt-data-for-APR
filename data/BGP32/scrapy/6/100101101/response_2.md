## Bug Explanation
The bug in the `convert_image` function arises from the incorrect handling of images with transparency. 

1. When the input image is in PNG format and has RGBA mode, the function is supposed to convert it to RGB by pasting the image onto a white background and then converting it. However, the `paste` method is called incorrectly as `background.paste(image, image)` which results in an error due to invalid argument type.
2. Additionally, when the image mode is not RGB, the function should convert it to RGB, but the conversion is not done appropriately.

## Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug in the `convert_image` function:
1. Correct the usage of the `paste` method to paste the image onto the background correctly.
2. Ensure that non-RGB images are properly converted to RGB.

## The Corrected Function
```python
def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
    if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA':
        background = Image.new('RGBA', image.size, (255, 255, 255))
        background.paste(image, (0, 0), mask=image.split()[3])  # Paste with alpha mask
        image = background.convert('RGB')
    elif image.mode != 'RGB':
        image = image.convert('RGB')

    if size:
        image = image.copy()
        image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)

    buf = BytesIO()
    image.save(buf, 'JPEG')
    return image, buf
```

With these corrections, the `convert_image` function should now correctly handle images with transparency and convert images to the desired formats, passing the failing test cases.
