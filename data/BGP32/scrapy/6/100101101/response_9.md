### Bug Explanation:

The bug in the `convert_image` function arises from incorrect handling of images with transparency. When the input image is in PNG format and has RGBA mode (transparency), the function incorrectly converts the image to RGB mode without preserving the alpha channel, resulting in loss of transparency in the converted image.

### Bug Fix Strategy:

To fix the bug, we need to adjust the conversion logic to handle RGBA images properly by preserving the alpha channel during the conversion process.

### Corrected Function:

```python
def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
    if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA':
        background = Image.new('RGBA', image.size, (255, 255, 255, 255))  # Include alpha channel in the background color
        background.paste(image, image)
        image = background.convert('RGBA')  # Preserve alpha channel during conversion
    elif image.mode != 'RGB':
        image = image.convert('RGB')

    if size:
        image = image.copy()
        image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)

    buf = BytesIO()
    image.save(buf, 'JPEG')
    return image, buf
```

By making these changes, the corrected function should now properly handle images with transparency, preserving the alpha channel during the conversion process. This adjustment ensures that the converted image retains its transparency when necessary.
