### Analysis
1. The buggy function is `convert_image` inside the `ImagesPipeline` class in the `scrapy/pipelines/images.py` file.
2. The function is responsible for converting images to the desired format and size.
3. The failing test `test_convert_image` in the `test_pipeline_images.py` file expects the converted image to produce specific results, but it fails due to incorrect conversion.
4. The error message indicates that the function is not producing the expected output for the color values in the converted images, causing the test to fail.
   
### Bug Cause
The primary cause of the bug is that the implementation of `convert_image` function does not handle transparent images correctly. Specifically, when the input image is in PNG format and mode RGBA, and it has transparency, the function converts it to RGB but does not account for the transparent values in the conversion, leading to incorrect color values in the converted image.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to modify the code to correctly handle the transparency in PNG images when converting them from RGBA to RGB. This involves creating a new background with a white color and then pasting the original image onto it to ensure the transparency is preserved in the conversion process.

### Corrected Code
Here is the corrected version of the `convert_image` function:

```python
def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
    if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA':
        background = Image.new('RGB', image.size, (255, 255, 255))
        background.paste(image, (0, 0), image)
        image = background.convert('RGB')
    elif image.mode != 'RGB':
        image = image.convert('RGB')

    if size:
        image = image.copy()
        image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)

    buf = BytesIO()
    image.save(buf, 'JPEG')
    return image, buf
```

By adjusting the conversion process for PNG RGBA images, the corrected function should now correctly preserve transparency and produce the expected color values for the converted images, allowing the failing test to pass.
