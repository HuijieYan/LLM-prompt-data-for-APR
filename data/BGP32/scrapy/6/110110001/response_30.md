### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `convert_image` is part of a class `ImagesPipeline`, which is a subclass of `FilesPipeline`.
2. The function is responsible for converting images to JPEG format and handling different cases like PNG with RGBA mode, RGB mode, and thumbnail resizing.
3. The failing test case is testing the conversion of images with different color modes and sizes. The error message indicates a mismatch in the list of colors after conversion.
4. The bug seems to be related to the incorrect conversion of images from RGBA to RGB mode.
   
### Bug Fix Strategy:
- The issue seems to be with how the function is handling images with RGBA mode. The background image creation and pasting logic need to be corrected. 
- Additionally, we need to ensure that the image mode is preserved correctly during the conversion process.
- The function should handle the RGBA to RGB conversion specifically to maintain the colors accurately.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
    if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA':
        background = Image.new('RGBA', image.size, (255, 255, 255))
        background.paste(image, (0, 0))
        image = background.convert('RGB')
    elif image.mode != 'RGB':
        image = image.convert('RGB')

    if size:
        image = image.copy()
        image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)

    buf = BytesIO()
    image.save(buf, 'JPEG')
    return image, buf
```

In the corrected version, the `paste` method for creating the background for RGBA images has been updated to correctly paste the image. Additionally, the `copy` method is used to ensure the original image is retained during the thumbnail creation process.
