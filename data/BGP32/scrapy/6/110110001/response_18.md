### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `convert_image` within the `ImagesPipeline` class is causing the failing test case to fail.
2. The `convert_image` function is supposed to convert images to JPEG format and resize them if needed.
3. The failing test is checking the converted image against an expected color, which fails due to incorrect conversion or resizing.
4. The error is likely happening when converting PNG images with transparency to RGB format.
   
### Bug Cause:
The bug is caused by the incorrect handling of PNG images with transparency. When the condition `image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA'` is met, the function incorrectly converts the image to RGB format, discarding the alpha channel information, leading to incorrect colors in the resulting image.

### Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, handle PNG images with transparency correctly by preserving the alpha channel information during the conversion. Additionally, ensure that the conversions and resizing are done correctly to pass the failing test cases.

### Corrected Version:
```python
from scrapy.pipelines.files import FilesPipeline

class ImagesPipeline(FilesPipeline):
    def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
        if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode in ['RGBA', 'LA']:
            image = image.convert('RGBA')
            background = Image.new('RGBA', image.size, (255, 255, 255, 255))
            image = Image.alpha_composite(background, image)
            image = image.convert('RGB')
        elif image.mode != 'RGB':
            image = image.convert('RGB')

        if size:
            image = image.copy()
            image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)

        buf = BytesIO()
        image.save(buf, 'JPEG')
        return image, buf
```

In the corrected version:
1. Added handling for PNG images with RGBA and LA modes to preserve transparency.
2. Used `Image.alpha_composite` to compose the image with a white background before converting to RGB.
3. Converted the image correctly based on its mode to maintain the correct image colors.
4. Ensured that the image is resized correctly when the `size` argument is provided.

This corrected version should now pass the failing test cases related to image conversions and resizing.
