### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `convert_image` within the `ImagesPipeline` class is responsible for converting an input image into a specified format. The function checks the image format and mode, then applies some conversions accordingly.
2. The function has logic to convert RGBA format PNG images to RGB format, as well as to convert any non-RGB mode images to RGB.
3. The failing test `test_convert_image` checks the conversion of images under different conditions, including RGB images, PNG images with transparency, and PNG images with palette mode. The error message indicates a mismatch in the expected and actual color values after the conversion.
4. The bug seems to be related to the conversion logic for PNG RGBA images, where the function should resize RGBA images with transparency properly.

### Bug Explanation:
The bug in the `convert_image` function is primarily related to the handling of PNG RGBA images. When encountering an RGBA image, it creates a new RGBA background, pastes the original image onto it, then converts the combined image to RGB. This conversion can lead to loss of the alpha channel information which affects the color values in the output.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to preserve the alpha channel information when converting RGBA images to RGB. One way to achieve this is by using the `Image.alpha_composite` method to maintain transparency during the conversion.

### Corrected Version:
```python
from PIL import Image
from cStringIO import StringIO as BytesIO

class ImagesPipeline(FilesPipeline):
    """
    Abstract pipeline that implement the image thumbnail generation logic
        
    """

    def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
        if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA':
            background = Image.new('RGBA', image.size, (255, 255, 255, 255)) # Add alpha channel
            background = Image.alpha_composite(background, image) # Maintain transparency
            image = background.convert('RGB')
        elif image.mode != 'RGB':
            image = image.convert('RGB')
        
        if size:
            image = image.copy()
            image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)
        
        buf = BytesIO()
        image.save(buf, 'JPEG')
        return image, buf
```

By modifying the conversion process for RGBA images to include background composition using `Image.alpha_composite`, we can ensure that the transparency information is retained during the conversion process. This corrected version should now pass the failing test without any color value mismatch errors.
