### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `convert_image` within the `ImagesPipeline` class is responsible for converting images to different formats and sizes.
2. The function checks the image format and converts it to the specified format and size.
3. The failing test `test_convert_image` is testing the functionality of this function with different image formats and sizes. The error message indicates that the function is not converting the images correctly to the expected format and size.
4. The bug in the function might be related to incorrect handling of transparent images with RGBA format and PNG format images.

### Bug Cause:
The bug arises from the incorrect handling of RGBA images with transparency while converting them to RGB images. The code specifically converts RGBA format PNG images to RGB format, but the transparency is not properly dealt with, leading to incorrect color values in the resulting image.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure proper handling of RGBA images with transparency during the conversion process. The code should correctly handle the transparency channel to avoid losing color information while converting images from RGBA to RGB format.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
    if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA':
        if image.getchannel('A').getbbox():
            # Image has transparency
            background = Image.new('RGB', image.size, (255, 255, 255))
            background.paste(image, image)
            image = background
        else:
            # Image doesn't have transparency, convert directly
            image = image.convert('RGB')
    elif image.mode != 'RGB':
        image = image.convert('RGB')

    if size:
        image = image.copy()
        image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)

    buf = BytesIO()
    image.save(buf, 'JPEG')
    return image, buf
```

By updating the conversion process to check for the presence of transparency in RGBA images before converting to RGB, and handling it accordingly, we can fix the bug and ensure the correct conversion of images with transparency.
