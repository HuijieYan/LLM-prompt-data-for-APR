### Bug Analysis:
1. The `convert_image` function in the `ImagesPipeline` class is intended to convert images to RGB format and potentially resize them.
2. The bug seems to be related to the conversion of RGBA images in PNG format. The function is incorrectly converting RGBA images to white background RGB images, which leads to incorrect results.
3. The failing test specifically checks the conversion of RGBA images to RGB format and its resulting colors, which are failing due to the bug in the function.
4. The bug is causing the converted RGBA images to have different colors than expected in the test cases, leading to the test failures.
5. The function should be fixed to correctly handle RGBA images during conversion.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Modify the function to properly handle RGBA images during conversion.
2. Use the alpha channel information of RGBA images to correctly convert them to RGB.
3. Update the conditional statements to check for RGBA images in PNG format and handle them accordingly.
4. Ensure that the function passes the provided test cases by converting RGBA images correctly.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
    if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA':
        image = image.convert('RGB')
    elif image.mode != 'RGB':
        image = image.convert('RGB')

    if size:
        image = image.copy()
        image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)

    buf = BytesIO()
    image.save(buf, 'JPEG')
    return image, buf
```

By making the above changes in the `convert_image` function, the bug related to incorrect conversion of RGBA images in PNG format should be fixed, and the function should pass the failing test cases successfully.
