### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `convert_image` is within the `ImagesPipeline` class, which is a subclass of `FilesPipeline`.
2. The function has logic to convert images to RGB format for JPEG saving and handling RGBA for PNG images.
3. The error message in the failing test indicates a mismatch in the colors of the images.
4. The cause of the bug seems to be the handling of RGBA images and conversion to RGB format.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is caused by the incorrect handling of RGBA images when converting them to RGB format in the `convert_image` function. The function is not correctly adjusting the transparency values during conversion, leading to a difference in colors between the original and converted images.

### Bug Fix:
To fix the bug, we need to handle the transparency correctly when converting images from RGBA to RGB format. We should preserve the color information while discarding the alpha channel appropriately.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
    if image.mode == 'RGBA':
        background = Image.new('RGB', image.size, (255, 255, 255))
        background.paste(image, mask=image.split()[3])  # Take only the alpha channel for pasting
        image = background
    elif image.mode != 'RGB':
        image = image.convert('RGB')

    if size:
        image = image.copy()
        image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)

    buf = BytesIO()
    image.save(buf, 'JPEG')
    return image, buf
```

With the corrected version of the `convert_image` function, the bug related to incorrect color handling when converting RGBA images to RGB format should be fixed. This fix should ensure that the colors are preserved correctly during conversion and pass the failing test.
