### Analysis:
1. The buggy function is `convert_image` in the `ImagesPipeline` class.
2. The function is supposed to convert images to RGB format and generate thumbnails if required.
3. The failing test `test_convert_image` checks the color channels and sizes of images after conversion.
4. The error message indicates a mismatch in the color values of the converted image.
5. The bug seems to be related to the handling of transparency in RGBA images.

### Bug:
The bug occurs when the function tries to handle RGBA images with a transparency channel. When the image format is PNG and the mode is RGBA, the function is attempting to convert the image to RGB by replacing transparency with white color. This leads to incorrect color values in the converted image, causing the test to fail.

### Fix:
To fix the bug, we need to handle RGBA images with transparency correctly. One approach is to fill the transparent parts with a white background only if the mode is RGBA and the format is PNG.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
    if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA':
        if image.mode == 'RGBA' and 'transparency' in image.info:
            background = Image.new('RGB', image.size, (255, 255, 255))
            image.load()
            background.paste(image, mask=image.split()[3])  # Paste using the alpha channel
            image = background
        else:
            image = image.convert('RGB')
    elif image.mode != 'RGB':
        image = image.convert('RGB')
    
    if size:
        image = image.copy()
        image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)

    buf = BytesIO()
    image.save(buf, 'JPEG')
    return image, buf
``` 

This corrected version ensures that if the image is RGBA and has transparency, the background will be filled with white before converting to RGB. This should prevent the incorrect color values in the converted image and make the failing test pass.
