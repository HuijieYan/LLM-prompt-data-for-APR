### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `convert_image` within the `ImagesPipeline` class is responsible for converting an image to a specific format and size if required.
2. The function checks if the input image is in a specific format and mode, then performs specific conversions.
3. The failing test `test_convert_image` checks if the function correctly converts images with different formats and modes, especially handling transparency.
4. The error message indicates that the conversion of images with transparency is not producing the expected result, leading to a test failure.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is caused by the incorrect handling of images with transparency (RGBA) and PNG format. The condition that checks if the image format is PNG and mode is RGBA executes code that pastes the image onto a white background and converts it to RGB. This discards the transparency information, leading to incorrect results in the test.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to modify the conversion logic for images with the PNG format and RGBA mode. We should keep the transparency information when converting such images.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
    if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA':
        converted_img = image.convert('RGBA')
    else:
        converted_img = image.convert('RGB')

    if size:
        converted_img.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)

    buf = BytesIO()
    converted_img.save(buf, 'JPEG')
    return converted_img, buf
```

In the corrected version:
- The image conversion logic for PNG format and RGBA mode images has been updated to preserve transparency.
- The function now keeps the transparency information when converting PNG images with RGBA mode while handling other cases appropriately.

This corrected version should address the bug and pass the failing test.
