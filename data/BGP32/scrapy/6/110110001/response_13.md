### Analysis:
1. **Buggy Function**: The `convert_image` function in the `ImagesPipeline` class is responsible for converting an image to a specific format and size.
   
2. **Buggy Class**: The `ImagesPipeline` class extends `FilesPipeline` and implements image thumbnail generation logic.
   
3. **Failing Test**: The failing test `test_convert_image` aims to check the correctness of the image conversion process in various scenarios, including RGB and JPEG, thumbnails maintaining image ratio, transparency cases with RGBA and PNG, and transparency cases with a palette.
   
4. **Error Message**: The error message indicates that there is a difference in the expected and actual colors of converted images in the failing test.

### Bug Location:
The bug might be in the condition where the image format is PNG and mode is RGBA, where it tries to convert the image format and remove transparency.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is happening when converting RGBA image format to RGB. It doesn't properly handle the transparency of the image during conversion, resulting in a different color output than expected.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
- Ensure that transparency in RGBA images is properly handled during the conversion process.
- Adjust the logic to maintain transparency for RGBA images while converting to RGB.
- Use the `Image.alpha_composite()` method to retain transparency during the conversion.
- Save the final image in the correct format (PNG if it started as a PNG) to avoid format loss during conversion.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
    if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA':
        background = Image.new('RGBA', image.size, (255, 255, 255, 255))
        background.paste(image, (0, 0), image)
        image = Image.alpha_composite(background.convert('RGB'), Image.new("RGB", image.size, (255, 255, 255)))
    elif image.mode != 'RGB':
        image = image.convert('RGB')

    if size:
        image = image.copy()
        image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)

    buf = BytesIO()
    if image.format == 'PNG':
        image.save(buf, 'PNG')
    else:
        image.save(buf, 'JPEG')
    
    return image, buf
```

This corrected version properly handles the transparency of RGBA images during conversion to RGB. It maintains the transparency by using `Image.alpha_composite()` and saves the final image in the correct format to prevent any information loss during the conversion process.
