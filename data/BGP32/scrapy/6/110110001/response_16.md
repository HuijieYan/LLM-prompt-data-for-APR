### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `convert_image` is a method of the `ImagesPipeline` class.
2. The function takes an image and an optional size parameter, converts the image to RGB format if needed, creates a thumbnail of the image if size is provided, saves the image in JPEG format, and returns the processed image and a buffer.
3. The failing test `test_convert_image` checks different scenarios involving image conversion. The error message indicates a mismatch in expected and actual colors after image conversion.
4. The bug is likely in the logic where the colors are not being converted accurately for certain image types.
  
### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. The bug occurs when the image format is PNG and the mode is RGBA. In this case, the image color is being set to white before converting to RGB. The color conversion seems to be incorrect, leading to the test failure.
2. To fix this issue, we need to handle RGBA images differently to ensure accurate color conversion while converting images.
3. We need to make sure that the color conversion is done correctly for all image modes to pass the failing test.

### Corrected Function:
```python
def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
    if image.format.upper() == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA':
        image = image.convert('RGB')
    elif image.mode != 'RGB':
        image = image.convert('RGB')

    if size:
        image = image.copy()
        image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)

    buf = BytesIO()
    image.save(buf, 'JPEG')
    return image, buf
```

In the corrected version:
- We check if the image format is PNG and mode is RGBA, then directly convert the image to RGB without creating a new background.
- For other modes, we ensure the conversion to RGB as needed.
- This updated logic should handle the color conversion correctly for all image types.
