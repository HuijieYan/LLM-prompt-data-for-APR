### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `convert_image` is part of the `ImagesPipeline` class which is a subclass of `FilesPipeline`.
2. The function is supposed to handle the conversion of images based on certain conditions like format and mode.
3. The failing test is trying to check if the conversion process produces the expected results but it fails due to differences in the expected and actual results.
4. The error message indicates that the first differing element in the comparison is `(10000, (0, 127, 255))` vs `(10000, (205, 230, 255))`.
5. The function fails to correctly handle the conversion of PNG images with RGBA mode and incorrectly converts colors.

### Bug Cause:
The buggy function does not correctly handle PNG images with RGBA mode. When the image format is PNG and mode is RGBA, it incorrectly converts the colors to RGB, leading to differences in the expected and actual results during testing.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
1. The bug can be fixed by modifying the conversion process for PNG images with RGBA mode to preserve the alpha channel.
2. We should check if the image format is PNG and mode is RGBA, and handle the conversion accordingly.

### Corrected Function:
```python
from PIL import Image
from cStringIO import StringIO as BytesIO
from PIL import ImageOps

class ImagesPipeline(FilesPipeline):
    """
    Abstract pipeline that implement the image thumbnail generation logic

    """

    def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
        if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA':
            # Preserve the alpha channel
            image = ImageOps.colorize(image, (0, 0, 0, 0), (255, 255, 255, 255))
        elif image.mode != 'RGB':
            image = image.convert('RGB')

        if size:
            image = image.copy()
            image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)

        buf = BytesIO()
        image.save(buf, 'JPEG')
        return image, buf
```

### Summary:
The corrected function modifies the conversion process for PNG images with RGBA mode to preserve the alpha channel, ensuring that the conversion produces the expected results. This fix should allow the failing test to pass successfully.
