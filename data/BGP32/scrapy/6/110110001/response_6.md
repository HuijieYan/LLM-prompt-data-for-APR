### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `convert_image` in the `ImagesPipeline` class is responsible for converting an image to a specific format and size.
2. The function checks if the image format is 'PNG' and the mode is 'RGBA', then it creates a new background and converts the image to 'RGB'. Otherwise, it converts the image to 'RGB'.
3. The failing test is calling the `convert_image` function with RGBA images and expecting the converted image to have specific colors.
4. The bug is related to how transparency in images is handled. The test is failing because the conversion from RGBA to RGB is not dealing with transparency correctly.
5. We need to handle transparency properly by considering the alpha channel in RGBA images.

### Bug Fix:
1. Update the `convert_image` function to handle transparency in RGBA images correctly.
2. When the image format is 'PNG' and mode is 'RGBA', we need to consider transparency by using the `putalpha` method before pasting the image onto the background.
3. Update the code to consider the alpha channel when converting RGBA to RGB.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
    if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA':
        background = Image.new('RGB', image.size, (255, 255, 255))
        background.paste(image, (0, 0), image.split()[-1])  # Paste the image with alpha channel
        image = background
    elif image.mode != 'RGB':
        image = image.convert('RGB')

    if size:
        image = image.copy()
        image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)

    buf = BytesIO()
    image.save(buf, 'JPEG')
    return image, buf
```

By updating the `convert_image` function to properly handle transparency in RGBA images, the corrected version should now pass the failing test.
