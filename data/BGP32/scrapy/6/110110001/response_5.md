### Analysis:
- The buggy function `convert_image` is part of the `ImagesPipeline` class, which is a subclass of `FilesPipeline`.
- The function tries to convert images to RGB format and JPEG encoding, but it seems to have issues with handling PNG images with RGBA mode.
- The failing test `test_convert_image` expects the converted image to have specific colors, but the function is not producing the expected results for PNG images with RGBA mode.
- The error message indicates a discrepancy in the colors of the converted image for PNG images with RGBA mode.

### Error Location:
- The issue lies in how the function handles PNG images with an RGBA mode and tries to convert them to RGB format.

### Bug Cause:
- The bug occurs because the function does not properly handle PNG images with RGBA mode. It incorrectly converts them to RGB without considering the alpha channel, leading to color discrepancies in the output image.

### Fix Strategy:
- Check the image mode before processing it and apply the correct conversion logic based on the image format and mode.
- If the image format is 'PNG' and the mode is 'RGBA', handle the conversion with alpha channel transparency in mind.
- Ensure that the function thumbnail generation maintains the image ratio when resizing.

### Corrected Function:
```python
# The corrected version of the convert_image function
def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
    if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA':
        background = Image.new('RGBA', image.size, (255, 255, 255, 255))  # Include 4th channel for alpha
        background.paste(image, (0, 0), image)  # Paste with transparency
        image = background.convert('RGB')
    elif image.mode != 'RGB':
        image = image.convert('RGB')

    if size:
        image = image.copy()
        image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)

    buf = BytesIO()
    image.save(buf, 'JPEG')
    return image, buf
```

By updating the `convert_image` function to handle PNG images with RGBA mode correctly, the function should now pass the failing test and produce the expected output for all image formats and modes.
