### Analysis:
1. The buggy function is `convert_image` defined within the `ImagesPipeline` class.
2. The function has a conditional statement checking for image format and mode, and then it uses `Image.new` to create a new image with a white background. It then pastes the original image over this background.
3. The failing test case checks for the correctness of the conversion of images with transparency. The error is likely caused by incorrect handling of transparency, and the failing assertion is related to the colors of the converted image.
4. The cause of the bug is incorrect handling of RGBA images with transparency. The buggy function does not properly handle the transparency channel when converting these images.
5. To fix the bug, we need to handle RGBA images correctly by preserving the alpha channel during conversion.

### Fix:
```python
def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
    if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA':
        background = Image.new('RGBA', image.size, (255, 255, 255, 255))  # Update to include alpha channel
        background.paste(image, image)
        image = background.convert('RGBA')  # Keep it RGBA after pasting
        
    elif image.mode != 'RGB':
        # For non-RGB images, preserve mode
        image = image.convert('RGB')
        
    if size:
        image = image.copy()
        image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)
    
    buf = BytesIO()
    image.save(buf, 'JPEG')
    return image, buf
```

This fix ensures that when dealing with images in RGBA mode, the function correctly handles the alpha channel, preserving transparency during the conversion process.
