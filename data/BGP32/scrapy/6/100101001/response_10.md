The bug in the provided function `convert_image` is specifically in the conditional check for the image format and mode. It is incorrectly handling the case when the image format is 'PNG' and mode is 'RGBA'. The function tries to convert the RGBA image to RGB by pasting it on a new RGBA background filled with white color, which is not the correct approach.

The correct strategy for fixing this bug is to first convert the image to RGB if the format is 'PNG' and the mode is 'RGBA'. We can then proceed to handle the resizing of the image if a size is specified. Finally, we save the image in JPEG format and return it with the BytesIO buffer.

Here is the corrected version of the `convert_image` function:

```python
def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
    if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA':
        image = image.convert('RGB')
    elif image.mode != 'RGB':
        image = image.convert('RGB')

    if size:
        image = image.copy()
        image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)

    buf = BytesIO()
    image.save(buf, 'JPEG')
    return image, buf
```

By making this correction, the function should now correctly handle the image conversions and resizing, passing the failing tests provided.
