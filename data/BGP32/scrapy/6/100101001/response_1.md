### Potential Error Locations:
1. The condition where the function checks if the image format is 'PNG' and mode is 'RGBA'.
2. The image conversion logic inside the first if statement.
3. The image conversion logic inside the second if statement.

### Bug Explanation:
The bug occurs when the image format is 'PNG' and mode is 'RGBA'. In this case, the function creates a new RGBA background image with white color and pastes the original image on it. However, during the paste operation, the original image is being pasted on itself, resulting in unexpected behavior. This leads to the conversion of the image to 'RGB' format with incorrect colors.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix this bug, we need to correct the paste operation inside the first if statement to avoid pasting the image on itself. Instead, we should paste the original image onto the newly created background image, ensuring the correct conversion to 'RGB'.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
    if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA':
        background = Image.new('RGBA', image.size, (255, 255, 255))
        background.paste(image, (0, 0), image)
        image = background.convert('RGB')
    elif image.mode != 'RGB':
        image = image.convert('RGB')

    if size:
        image = image.copy()
        image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)

    buf = BytesIO()
    image.save(buf, 'JPEG')
    return image, buf
```

By correcting the paste operation inside the first if statement, the function now pastes the original image onto the background image properly, fixing the bug and ensuring the correct conversion to 'RGB'.
