### Analysis:
The buggy function `convert_image` is intended to convert images to RGB format and resize them if necessary. However, there are multiple issues in the function:
1. The condition for checking if the image is PNG and RGBA is incorrect. It should check if the format is PNG and the mode is RGBA.
2. When pasting the image onto a new background, the background image should be converted to RGBA to support transparency.
3. When resizing the image, it should be done proportionally to maintain the aspect ratio.

### Bug:
The bug is mainly caused by incorrect handling of PNG images with transparency. The function does not properly convert the background to RGBA before pasting the original image onto it, leading to loss of transparency in the converted image.

### Fix:
To fix the bug, we need to update the function to correctly handle PNG images with transparent backgrounds. Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
    if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA':
        background = Image.new('RGBA', image.size, (255, 255, 255, 255))
        background.paste(image, (0, 0), image)
        image = background.convert('RGB')
    elif image.mode != 'RGB':
        image = image.convert('RGB')

    if size:
        image = image.copy()
        image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)

    buf = BytesIO()
    image.save(buf, 'JPEG')
    return image, buf
```

With this revision, the function should now correctly handle PNG images with transparent backgrounds and pass the failing test provided.
