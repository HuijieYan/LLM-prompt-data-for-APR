The buggy function has a logic error in the conditional statement where it checks if the image format is 'PNG' and the mode is 'RGBA'. It then creates a new RGBA background image and pastes the original image on it. However, when pasting the image onto the background, it mistakenly used the image itself instead of (0,0) as the coordinate. This results in the original image being pasted multiple times onto the background, leading to unexpected behavior.

To fix this bug, we need to change `background.paste(image, image)` to `background.paste(image, (0, 0))` so that the original image is correctly pasted onto the background at the top left corner.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
    if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA':
        background = Image.new('RGBA', image.size, (255, 255, 255))
        background.paste(image, (0, 0))  # fix: paste the image at (0,0) on the background
        image = background.convert('RGB')
    elif image.mode != 'RGB':
        image = image.convert('RGB')

    if size:
        image = image.copy()
        image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)

    buf = BytesIO()
    image.save(buf, 'JPEG')
    return image, buf
``` 

With this correction, the function should now correctly handle pasting the image onto the background and pass the failing test cases.
