### Bug Explanation
The bug in the `convert_image` function lies in the conditional statement checking if the image format is PNG and the mode is RGBA. In this case, the function creates a white background image and pastes the original image onto it. However, when using the `paste` method, the correct argument should be the target position within the background image rather than the source image itself. This results in not pasting the original image onto the background properly, leading to unexpected behavior.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix this bug, we need to modify the `paste` method call to correctly paste the original image onto the background image. Specifically, we should pass `(0, 0)` as the position argument to `paste` to ensure that the original image is pasted at the top left corner of the background image.

### Corrected Version of the Function
```python
def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
    if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA':
        background = Image.new('RGBA', image.size, (255, 255, 255))
        background.paste(image, (0, 0))
        image = background.convert('RGB')
    elif image.mode != 'RGB':
        image = image.convert('RGB')

    if size:
        image = image.copy()
        image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)

    buf = BytesIO()
    image.save(buf, 'JPEG')
    return image, buf
``` 

By making this change, the `convert_image` function will correctly paste the original image onto the white background image, resolving the bug and ensuring that the tests pass successfully.
