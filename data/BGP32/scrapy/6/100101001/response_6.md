### Analysis:
The buggy function has two main issues:
1. When the input image format is PNG and mode is RGBA, the function incorrectly converts the image to RGB format by creating a new white background and then pasting the original image on it. This process does not preserve the transparency of the original image.
2. The function does not handle the case when the input image's mode is 'P' (palette mode).

### Bug Cause:
In Case 3, the bug is triggered when the input image is PNG with RGBA mode. The function creates a new white background image, pastes the original image on it, and converts it to RGB, resulting in loss of transparency. This behavior is incorrect as it should preserve the transparency of the input image.

### Bug Fix:
To fix the bug, we need to modify the function to properly handle different image modes, ensuring that transparency is preserved when converting to RGB. Additionally, we need to update the function to handle the case when the input image mode is 'P' correctly.

### Corrected Function:
```python
def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
    if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA':
        image = image.convert('RGBA')  # Convert to RGBA mode to preserve transparency
    elif image.mode != 'RGB':
        image = image.convert('RGB')

    if size:
        image = image.copy()
        image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)

    buf = BytesIO()
    image.save(buf, 'JPEG')
    return image, buf
```

By converting the image to RGBA when the input format is PNG and mode is RGBA, we ensure that transparency is preserved. Additionally, by converting images to RGB only if their mode is not already RGB, we handle different image modes correctly.
