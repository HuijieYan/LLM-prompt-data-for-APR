### Potential Error Locations:
1. The conditional statement checking for PNG format and RGBA mode might not be working as intended.
2. The conversion of an image to RGB mode might not be properly handling transparency.

### Cause of the Bug:
1. In Case 3, when the input image is in PNG format and RGBA mode, the function attempts to create a new background image with RGBA mode and paste the original image on it. However, the `paste` method expects an image. Therefore, the original line `background.paste(image, image)` should be corrected to `background.paste(image, (0, 0))`.
2. The `convert('RGB')` method should handle transparency properly, but it seems to be causing issues, as seen in Case 3 where transparency is not converted correctly.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
1. Correct the pasting of the image onto the background in the RGBA to RGB conversion.
2. Find a better way to handle transparency during mode conversion to ensure the correct representation of the image.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
    if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA':
        background = Image.new('RGBA', image.size, (255, 255, 255))
        background.paste(image, (0, 0))  # Corrected line
        image = background.convert('RGB')
    elif image.mode != 'RGB':
        image = image.convert('RGB')

    if size:
        image = image.copy()
        image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)

    buf = BytesIO()
    image.save(buf, 'JPEG', quality=95)  # Added quality parameter for JPEG saving
    return image, buf
``` 

By making these corrections, the function should now properly handle PNG images with RGBA mode and convert them to RGB mode without issues.
