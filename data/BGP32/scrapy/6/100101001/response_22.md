### Bug Explanation
The bug in the `convert_image` function occurs when the input image is in `PNG` format and `RGBA` mode. In the buggy code, there is a check to convert the image to RGB mode if it is not already in that mode. However, when the input image is in `PNG` format and `RGBA` mode, the code mistakenly creates a new `RGBA` background image, pastes the original image onto it, and then converts the background to `RGB` mode. This transformation is incorrect and leads to unexpected results.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to handle the case when the input image is in `PNG` format and `RGBA` mode differently. Instead of creating a new background image, pasting the original image onto it, and converting it to `RGB` mode, we should directly convert the original image to `RGB` mode when it is in `PNG` format and `RGBA` mode.

### Corrected Version of the Function
```python
def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
    if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA':
        image = image.convert('RGB')
    elif image.mode != 'RGB':
        image = image.convert('RGB')

    if size:
        image = image.copy()
        image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)

    buf = BytesIO()
    image.save(buf, 'JPEG')
    return image, buf
```

By directly converting the image to `RGB` mode when it is in `PNG` format and `RGBA` mode, the corrected function should now output the correct results and pass the failing test cases.
