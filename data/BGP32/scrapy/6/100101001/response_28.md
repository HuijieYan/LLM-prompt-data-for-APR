### Issues/Errors identified in the buggy function:
1. In the `convert_image` function, there is a condition that checks if the input image format is 'PNG' and mode is 'RGBA', but the subsequent logic to handle this condition seems incorrect. The logic tries to create a new image with a white background and then paste the original image onto it before converting it to 'RGB', which may lead to unexpected results.

### Bug Cause:
- The bug occurs due to incorrect handling of images with format 'PNG' and mode 'RGBA'. Instead of converting such images properly, the function creates a new image with a white background and pastes the original image onto it. This can cause issues with transparency and image quality.

### Strategy for fixing the bug:
1. Check the image format and mode separately to handle 'PNG' and 'RGBA' images correctly.
2. Ensure proper conversion of images while maintaining transparency if required.

### Corrected Version of the function:
```python
def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
    if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA':
        image = image.convert('RGB')
    elif image.mode != 'RGB':
        image = image.convert('RGB')

    if size:
        image = image.copy()
        image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)

    buf = BytesIO()
    image.save(buf, 'JPEG')
    return image, buf
```

By simplifying the logic in the function to correctly convert images based on their format and mode, the corrected version should address the issues and allow the failing test cases to pass.
