### Bug analysis
The bug in the `convert_image` function seems to be in the conditional check for PNG images with RGBA mode. When the input image is PNG with RGBA mode, the function creates a new image with RGBA mode filled with white background, pastes the input image onto the new image, and then converts it to RGB mode. However, during the process, the `paste` method might be causing an issue.

### Bug explanation
1. In Case 3, where the input image is PNG with RGBA mode, the function creates a new RGBA image called `background` using `Image.new('RGBA', image.size, (255, 255, 255))`.
2. Then it pastes the original RGBA image onto `background` using `background.paste(image, image)`.
3. The problem lies in the `paste` method where the second argument should be a tuple specifying the position to paste the input image. However, passing `image` as the second argument might be causing the paste operation to fail.
4. Due to this failure, the image is not pasted correctly, leading to incorrect conversion to RGB mode.

### Bug fix strategy
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the `paste` method receives the correct parameters. We should provide the position tuple where the input image should be pasted onto the new image.

### Corrected version of the function
```python
def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
    if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA':
        background = Image.new('RGBA', image.size, (255, 255, 255))
        background.paste(image, (0, 0), image)
        image = background.convert('RGB')
    elif image.mode != 'RGB':
        image = image.convert('RGB')

    if size:
        image = image.copy()
        image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)

    buf = BytesIO()
    image.save(buf, 'JPEG')
    return image, buf
```

By providing the correct position tuple `(0, 0)` in the `paste` method, we ensure that the original image is correctly pasted onto the new background image. This should fix the bug and make the function work as expected.
