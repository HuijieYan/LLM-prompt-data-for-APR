### Analysis
The buggy function `convert_image` is designed to convert images to RGB format and resize them if needed. However, there are issues in handling images with transparency and converting images to the correct format. 

1. In Case 1, the function fails to handle the image format and just returns the input image as is without applying any conversion or resizing.
2. In Case 2, the function does not correctly resize the image based on the specified size.
3. In Case 3, the function incorrectly converts RGBA images to RGB by filling the background with white color, which might not preserve the original transparency information.
4. In Case 4, when converting images with an indexed palette (mode 'P'), the function fails to correctly convert them to RGB.

### Bug Cause
The main causes of the bugs are:
- Incorrect handling of image formats and modes.
- Inadequate resizing logic that does not maintain the aspect ratio.
- Incorrect conversion of RGBA images to RGB, potentially losing transparency information.
- Improper handling of indexed palette images when converting to RGB.

### Fix Strategy
To fix the bugs in the `convert_image` function:
1. Ensure that the function correctly handles different image formats and modes.
2. Implement proper resizing logic that maintains the aspect ratio.
3. Preserve transparency when converting RGBA images to RGB.
4. Handle the conversion of indexed palette images to RGB properly.

### Corrected Version
```python
def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
    # Ensure image mode is RGB for further processing
    if image.mode != 'RGB':
        image = image.convert('RGB')

    # Resize image if size is provided
    if size:
        image = image.copy()
        image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)

    buf = BytesIO()
    
    # Make sure to save the image with its original format instead of JPEG
    image.save(buf, image.format)
    
    return image, buf
``` 

By using the corrected version of the `convert_image` function, the mentioned issues should be addressed, and the failing test cases should pass successfully.
