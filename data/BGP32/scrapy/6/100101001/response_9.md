The bug in the `convert_image` function stems from the incorrect handling of PNG images with RGBA mode. The function tries to convert RGBA PNG images to RGB by pasting the image on a white background, which does not handle transparency correctly. This results in a loss of transparency information in the converted image.

To fix this bug, we need to preserve transparency when converting RGBA PNG images to RGB. We can achieve this by using the `convert_alpha` method from the PIL library to convert RGBA images to RGB while preserving transparency.

Here is the corrected version of the `convert_image` function:

```python
def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
    if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA':
        image = image.convert('RGBA')  # Ensure the image is in RGBA mode
        image = image.convert_alpha()  # Convert RGBA to RGB while preserving transparency
    elif image.mode != 'RGB':
        image = image.convert('RGB')

    if size:
        image = image.copy()
        image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)

    buf = BytesIO()
    image.save(buf, 'JPEG')
    return image, buf
```

By using `convert_alpha` on RGBA images, we ensure that transparency is preserved when converting to RGB. This correction should address the issue with the failing test cases related to transparency in PNG images.
