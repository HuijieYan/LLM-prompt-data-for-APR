### Analysis
The buggy function `convert_image` is designed to convert images to JPEG format and resize them if a size is specified. However, there are a few issues that need to be addressed:
1. The condition to check if the image format is PNG and the mode is RGBA to create a new background image is incorrect. It should be checking if the format is PNG and the mode is RGBA to handle transparency correctly.
2. After pasting the image onto a white background, the image should be converted to RGB format to remove the alpha channel.
3. When resizing the image, the aspect ratio is not maintained properly, leading to incorrect dimensions in some cases.

### Bug Explanation
1. Case 1 and Case 2: The function incorrectly handles the image format and mode, leading to issues in maintaining transparency and converting images correctly.
2. Case 3: The function incorrectly pastes the RGBA image onto a white background without handling transparency correctly.
3. Case 4: The function fails to consider images with mode 'P' before converting them to RGB format, leading to incorrect results.

### Bug Fix
To fix the bug, the following changes need to be made to the `convert_image` function:
1. Check if the image format is PNG and if the mode is RGBA separately and handle transparency issues accordingly.
2. After pasting the image onto a background, convert the image to RGB format to remove the alpha channel.
3. Maintain the aspect ratio when resizing images.

### Corrected Version of the Function
```python
def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
    if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA':
        background = Image.new('RGBA', image.size, (255, 255, 255, 255))
        background.paste(image, (0, 0), image)
        image = background.convert('RGB')
    elif image.mode != 'RGB':
        image = image.convert('RGB')

    if size:
        image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)

    buf = BytesIO()
    image.save(buf, 'JPEG')
    return image, buf
``` 

After applying these fixes, the `convert_image` function should now handle image conversion and resizing correctly, passing the failing test cases provided.
