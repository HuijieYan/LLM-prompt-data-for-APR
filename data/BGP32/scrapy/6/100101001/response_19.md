### Bug Explanation
The bug in the `convert_image` function arises from incorrectly handling images with transparency (alpha channel). The function first checks if the image format is PNG and the mode is RGBA, in which case it tries to convert the image to RGB by creating a new white background image and pasting the original image onto it. However, the `paste` function expects a tuple for the second argument, specifying the coordinates to paste the image. Instead of passing the image itself, it should pass the coordinates `(0,0)`. This results in incorrect conversion of RGBA images to RGB.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to correct the `paste` function call by providing the coordinates `(0,0)` for pasting the image onto the background. Additionally, we should ensure that transparency is handled properly during the conversion process.

### Corrected Version of the Function
```python
def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
    if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA':
        background = Image.new('RGBA', image.size, (255, 255, 255))
        background.paste(image, (0, 0))
        image = background.convert('RGB')
    elif image.mode != 'RGB':
        image = image.convert('RGB')

    if size:
        image = image.copy()
        image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)

    buf = BytesIO()
    image.save(buf, 'JPEG')
    return image, buf
``` 

By making the mentioned correction in the pasting process, the function should now handle RGBA images correctly and pass the failing test cases.
