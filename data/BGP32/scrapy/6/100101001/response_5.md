### Analysis:
1. The function `convert_image` is designed to handle different image formats and modes, converting them to RGB mode and thumbnailing them if a size is provided.
2. The bug seems to be related to the handling of RGBA format images when converting them to RGB format.
3. In Case 3, when the input image is in PNG format and RGBA mode, the conversion to RGB is not correctly handling the transparency channel, resulting in unexpected color values.
4. The bug is likely in the conditional block where PNG images in RGBA mode are converted to RGB. The `paste` method might not be handling the transparency properly.
   
### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that transparency in RGBA images is correctly handled when converting them to RGB. One approach could be to use the `convert_alpha` method provided by the `Image` module to properly convert RGBA images to RGB while preserving the transparency.

### Corrected Function:
```python
def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
    if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA':
        image = image.convert_alpha()  # Convert RGBA image to RGB while preserving transparency
    elif image.mode != 'RGB':
        image = image.convert('RGB')

    if size:
        image = image.copy()
        image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)

    buf = BytesIO()
    image.save(buf, 'JPEG')
    return image, buf
``` 

By using the `convert_alpha` method for RGBA images, we ensure that transparency is correctly preserved during conversion to RGB, fixing the bug and making the function behave as expected.
