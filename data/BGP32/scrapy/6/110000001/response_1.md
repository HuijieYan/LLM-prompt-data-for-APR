# The buggy function `convert_image` has a couple of potential error locations:
1. The condition `if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA':` might not cover all cases where a PNG image with RGBA mode needs conversion.
2. The line `background.paste(image, image)` could be incorrect as the `background.paste()` method expects a tuple representing the position, not an image.

# The bug is likely caused by incorrect handling of PNG images with RGBA mode in the `convert_image` function. The condition checking for PNG format and RGBA mode may not be sufficient to handle all scenarios where conversion is needed. Additionally, the `background.paste(image, image)` line may not have the intended effect.

# To fix the bug, we need to ensure proper conversion for PNG images with RGBA mode. We can use the `image.convert(mode)` method to handle different image modes correctly.

# Here is the corrected version of the `convert_image` function:

```python
def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
    if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA':
        image = image.convert('RGB')
    
    if size:
        image = image.copy()
        image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)

    buf = BytesIO()
    image.save(buf, 'JPEG')
    return image, buf
```
