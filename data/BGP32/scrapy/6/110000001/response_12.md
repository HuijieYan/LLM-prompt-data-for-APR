## Analysis:
The `convert_image` function in the `ImagesPipeline` class is responsible for converting images to the RGB mode and resizing them if needed. The function has a bug where it incorrectly handles images with RGBA format. 

## Error Location:
The bug occurs in the following code snippet:
```python
if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA':
    background = Image.new('RGBA', image.size, (255, 255, 255))
    background.paste(image, image)
    image = background.convert('RGB')
```
The background image is created with RGBA mode but then pasted with the input image as it is without converting it to RGB. This results in an incorrect conversion.

## Bug Explanation:
The bug occurs because the background image is created in RGBA mode, but then the original image is pasted onto it without converting it to RGB first. This leads to incorrect color information in the resulting image.

## Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to first convert the input image to RGB mode before pasting it onto the background image. This ensures that the color information is accurately preserved during the conversion process.

## Corrected Version:
Here is the corrected version of the `convert_image` function:
```python
def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
    if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA':
        background = Image.new('RGBA', image.size, (255, 255, 255))
        image = image.convert('RGB')  # Convert the input image to RGB mode
        background.paste(image, (0, 0))
        image = background.convert('RGB')
    elif image.mode != 'RGB':
        image = image.convert('RGB')

    if size:
        image = image.copy()
        image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)

    buf = BytesIO()
    image.save(buf, 'JPEG')
    return image, buf
``` 

This corrected version ensures that the input image is converted to RGB mode before pasting it onto the background image, resulting in a proper conversion process.
