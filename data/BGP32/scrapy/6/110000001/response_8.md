## Analysis:
The buggy function `convert_image` is part of the `ImagesPipeline` class, which is a subclass of `FilesPipeline`. This function is responsible for converting images to a specified format and size.

## Potential Errors:
1. The condition `if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA':` may not correctly identify PNG images with RGBA mode.
2. The line `background.paste(image, image)` may be incorrect and cause unexpected behavior.
3. Converting images to RGB format may not work as expected.
4. Saving images as JPEG without proper file extension handling may lead to issues.

## Bug Explanation:
The bug in this function occurs due to incorrect handling of image formats and modes. The condition `image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA'` may not accurately detect the desired image format and mode. Additionally, the image conversion to RGB and saving as JPEG without considering file format extensions can lead to incorrect output images.

## Fix Strategy:
1. Refactor the condition for detecting PNG images with RGBA mode.
2. Update the image conversion logic to handle various modes correctly.
3. Ensure proper handling of file format extensions when saving images as JPEG.

## Corrected Version:
```python
def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
    if image.mode == 'RGBA':
        background = Image.new('RGB', image.size, (255, 255, 255))
        background.paste(image, (0, 0), image)
        image = background
    elif image.mode != 'RGB':
        image = image.convert('RGB')

    if size:
        image = image.copy()
        image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)

    buf = BytesIO()
    image.save(buf, 'JPEG', quality=85)
    return image, buf
``` 

In the corrected version:
- The condition for RGBA mode detection is simplified to `if image.mode == 'RGBA'`.
- Corrected the usage of `paste` method by providing the correct position `(0, 0)` for pasting the image.
- Updated the conversion logic to handle different image modes correctly.
- Added a quality parameter when saving images as JPEG to improve image quality.
