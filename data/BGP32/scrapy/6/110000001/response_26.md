## Analysis:
1. The `convert_image` function is a method of the `ImagesPipeline` class.
2. The function takes an image and an optional size parameter for resizing.
3. The function seems to aim at converting images to RGB format and resizing them.
4. There are potential issues with the image format check and thumbnail generation logic.

## Bugs:
1. The condition `image.format == 'PNG'` is case-sensitive and should be `image.format.upper() == 'PNG'.
2. There is an issue with the `background.paste` line where the `image` is passed as the second argument instead of `(0,0)` as a tuple to define the starting position.

## Bug Fix:
Here is the corrected version of the `convert_image` function:

```python
def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
    if image.format.upper() == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA':
        background = Image.new('RGBA', image.size, (255, 255, 255))
        background.paste(image, (0, 0))  # Fix: Providing starting position as (0, 0)
        image = background.convert('RGB')
    elif image.mode != 'RGB':
        image = image.convert('RGB')

    if size:
        image = image.copy()
        image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)

    buf = BytesIO()
    image.save(buf, format='JPEG')  # Fix: Providing format='JPEG' explicitly
    return image, buf
```

This corrected version fixes the issues with the buggy function in terms of case-sensitive comparison and the correct usage of the `paste` method. Now the function should work correctly for converting images and generating thumbnails.
