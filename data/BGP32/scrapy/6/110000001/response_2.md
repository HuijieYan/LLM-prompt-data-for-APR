## Analysis:
The buggy function `convert_image` is responsible for converting an image to a specific format and size. The potential error locations within this function are:
1. The condition `image.format == 'PNG'` should be `image.format == 'PNG'` in the first if statement.
2. The `paste` method should be called as `background.paste(image, (0,0))` by providing the position `(0,0)` to paste the image on the background.

## Bug Explanation:
The bug in the buggy function is caused by the incorrect condition checking for the image format and mode, which leads to the incorrect image conversion logic. Additionally, the incorrect usage of the `paste` method causes the image not to be properly pasted on the background.

## Bug Fix:
To fix the bug, we need to correct the condition in the first if statement and fix the `paste` method call to correctly paste the image on the background.

## Corrected Version:
```python
def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
    if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA':
        background = Image.new('RGBA', image.size, (255, 255, 255))
        background.paste(image, (0, 0))
        image = background.convert('RGB')
    elif image.mode != 'RGB':
        image = image.convert('RGB')

    if size:
        image = image.copy()
        image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)

    buf = BytesIO()
    image.save(buf, 'JPEG')
    return image, buf
```
