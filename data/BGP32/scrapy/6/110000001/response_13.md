## Analysis:
The `convert_image` function is within a class called `ImagesPipeline`, which is a subclass of `FilesPipeline`. This function's purpose is to convert images to a specific format for thumbnail generation.

## Potential error locations:
1. The condition `if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA':` might not cover all possible formats and modes of the image.
2. In the line `background.paste(image, image)`, the image pasting operation may have a mistake.
3. The save format `'JPEG'` is hardcoded which might not be suitable for all scenarios.

## Bug Explanation:
The bug in the provided function lies in the incorrect handling of images that are not in 'PNG' format or 'RGBA' mode. The function wrongly converts all non-'RGB' mode images to 'RGB', which can result in image distortion or loss of information.

## Strategy for fixing the bug:
1. Check and handle all possible image formats and modes correctly.
2. Ensure that the pasting operation in the code is done properly.
3. Consider making the save format dynamic or configurable based on the input image format.

## Corrected Version:
```python
def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
    if image.mode != 'RGB':
        if image.mode == 'RGBA':
            background = Image.new('RGB', image.size, (255, 255, 255))
            background.paste(image, (0, 0), image)
            image = background
        else:
            image = image.convert('RGB')
    
    if size:
        image = image.copy()
        image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)
    
    format = image.format if image.format else 'JPEG'
    
    buf = BytesIO()
    image.save(buf, format)
    return image, buf
```

In the corrected version:
1. All modes other than 'RGBA' are converted to 'RGB' without distortion.
2. The pasting operation has been corrected with the appropriate parameters.
3. The save format is determined dynamically based on the input image format or defaults to 'JPEG'.
