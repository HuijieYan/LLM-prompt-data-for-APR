The buggy function `convert_image` in the `ImagesPipeline` class has a couple of potential error locations:
1. The condition `if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA':` may not be handling all cases correctly.
2. The statement `background.paste(image, image)` may not be pasting the image correctly.
3. The image is saved as a JPEG file no matter what format it originally had.

The cause of the bug is that the function is not handling all image formats and modes properly, and it always saves the image as a JPEG file even if it was originally a PNG.

To fix the bug, we should modify the function as follows:
```python
# Fixed version of the convert_image function
def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
    if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA':
        background = Image.new('RGB', image.size, (255, 255, 255))
        background.paste(image, (0, 0))
        image = background.convert('RGB')
    elif image.mode != 'RGB':
        image = image.convert('RGB')

    if size:
        image = image.copy()
        image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)

    # Save the image based on its original format
    buf = BytesIO()
    image.save(buf, image.format)
    return image, buf
```

In the corrected version, we handle all image formats and modes properly, paste the image correctly onto the background, and save the image based on its original format.
