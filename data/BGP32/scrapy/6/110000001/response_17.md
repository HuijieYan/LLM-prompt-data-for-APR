The bug in the `convert_image` function is that the `save` method is trying to save the image in 'JPEG' format regardless of the original image format, which may cause an error if the original format is not compatible with 'JPEG'.

To fix this bug, we need to consider the original image format when saving the image. We can achieve this by getting the format of the original image and using that format when calling the `save` method.

Here is the corrected version of the `convert_image` function:

```python
def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
    if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA':
        background = Image.new('RGBA', image.size, (255, 255, 255))
        background.paste(image, image)
        image = background.convert('RGB')
    elif image.mode != 'RGB':
        image = image.convert('RGB')

    if size:
        image = image.copy()
        image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)

    buf = BytesIO()
    image.save(buf, image.format)  # Save the image with its original format
    return image, buf
``` 

By using `image.format` as the second argument in the `save` method, we ensure that the image is saved in its original format, resolving the bug.
