## Analysis:
The `convert_image` function is within the `ImagesPipeline` class, which is a subclass of `FilesPipeline`. The function is responsible for converting images to the desired format and size.

## Potential Error Locations:
1. Checking the image format - the comparison should not be case-sensitive.
2. Incorrect usage of `paste` method in the code block handling PNG images with RGBA mode.
3. Incorrect image save format specified as 'JPEG'.

## Bug Explanation:
1. The comparison of image format 'PNG' is case-sensitive, so images with 'png' format will not be properly handled.
2. The `paste` method used to blend the image with the background is incorrect and results in an error.
3. Saving the image as 'JPEG' regardless of the original format can cause loss of image quality and other issues.

## Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
1. Make the comparison case-insensitive for the image format check.
2. Correct the usage of the `paste` method to blend the images.
3. Use the appropriate format for saving the image based on the original format.

## Corrected Version:
```python
def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
        if image.format.upper() == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA':
            background = Image.new('RGB', image.size, (255, 255, 255))
            background.paste(image, (0, 0), image)
            image = background.convert('RGB')
        elif image.mode != 'RGB':
            image = image.convert('RGB')
    
        if size:
            image = image.copy()
            image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)
    
        buf = BytesIO()
        image.save(buf, image.format)
        return image, buf
```

In the corrected version:
1. The comparison of image format is converted to uppercase to make it case-insensitive.
2. The usage of the `paste` method is corrected to blend the images properly.
3. The save format for the image is set based on the original format of the image.
