## Analysis:
- The `convert_image` function is responsible for converting images to a specified size and format.
- It checks if the image format is PNG and mode is RGBA, then converts it to RGB format with white background.
- It also converts images to RGB format if not already in that format.
- It creates a thumbnail of the image with the specified size if provided.
- Finally, it saves the image in JPEG format and returns the image and the BytesIO buffer containing the image data.

## Identified potential error locations:
1. The condition to check the image format and mode might not handle all cases correctly.
2. The conversion of RGBA images to RGB mode might not be done properly.
3. The generation of thumbnail and saving the image in JPEG format might have issues.

## Bug Explanation:
The bug in the `convert_image` function is the incorrect usage of the `paste` method on the `background` image to paste the `image`. The correct usage should be `background.paste(image, (0, 0), image)`, where the position should be specified as `(0, 0)`.

## Strategy for fixing the bug:
1. Modify the `background.paste()` call to include the correct position `(0, 0)` to paste the image.
2. Ensure that the conditions for image format and mode checking are handling all cases correctly.
3. Verify that the thumbnail generation and saving in JPEG format are working as intended.

## Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
    if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA':
        background = Image.new('RGBA', image.size, (255, 255, 255))
        background.paste(image, (0, 0), image)
        image = background.convert('RGB')
    elif image.mode != 'RGB':
        image = image.convert('RGB')

    if size:
        image = image.copy()
        image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)

    buf = BytesIO()
    image.save(buf, 'JPEG')
    return image, buf
```
