The potential error locations within the buggy function `convert_image` are:

1. The condition to check if the image format is 'PNG' and image mode is 'RGBA' may not work as intended.
2. The `image.save(buf, 'JPEG')` call may lead to incorrect saving of the image if the image format is different from 'JPEG'.

The cause of the bug is that the function may not handle different image formats and modes correctly, leading to incorrect processing and saving of images.

To fix the bug, a strategy would be to:
1. Use the `image.format` attribute to check the image format correctly.
2. Handle converting the image to the desired format based on its original format.

Here is the corrected version of the `convert_image` function:

```python
def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
    if image.format != 'JPEG':
        image = image.convert('RGB')
        
    if size:
        image = image.copy()
        image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)

    buf = BytesIO()
    image.save(buf, 'JPEG')
    return image, buf
```

In this corrected version:
1. We first check if the image format is not 'JPEG', then convert the image to 'RGB' mode to handle different image formats.
2. We proceed with resizing the image if a specific size is specified.
3. Finally, we save the image in 'JPEG' format to the buffer.

This should address the potential issues with the buggy function and ensure correct processing and saving of images.
