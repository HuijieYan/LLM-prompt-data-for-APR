## Analysis:
The `convert_image` function in the `ImagesPipeline` class is responsible for converting an image to a specific format and size. The function checks if the image format is PNG and mode is RGBA, then it creates a new image with a white background and converts it to RGB. If the mode is not RGB, it converts the image to RGB. Finally, it resizes the image to the given size and saves it as a JPEG image in a BytesIO buffer.

## Identified potential error locations:
1. The condition for checking the image format is case-sensitive ('PNG' vs 'png').
2. The line `background.paste(image, image)` should be corrected to `background.paste(image, (0, 0, image.size[0], image.size[1]))`.

## Explanation of the bug:
The bug in the function arises due to the case-sensitive comparison of the image format and the incorrect usage of the `paste` method. Additionally, the function does not handle the case where size is not provided, which could potentially cause an error.

## Strategy for fixing the bug:
1. Change the condition for checking the image format to be case-insensitive.
2. Correct the usage of the `paste` method to avoid the bug in merging images incorrectly.
3. Add a check for the existence of a size parameter before resizing the image.

## Bug-fixed version of the function:
```python
    def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
        if image.format.upper() == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA':
            background = Image.new('RGBA', image.size, (255, 255, 255))
            background.paste(image, (0, 0, image.size[0], image.size[1]))
            image = background.convert('RGB')
        elif image.mode != 'RGB':
            image = image.convert('RGB')
    
        if size:
            image = image.copy()
            image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)
    
        buf = BytesIO()
        image.save(buf, 'JPEG')
        return image, buf
``` 

In the corrected version:
- The comparison for image format is made case-insensitive using `upper()` method.
- The `paste` method is used correctly by providing the coordinates for pasting the image.
- A check for the existence of size before resizing is included to prevent potential errors.
