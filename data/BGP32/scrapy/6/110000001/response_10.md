The buggy function provided is `convert_image(self, image, size=None)`. 

### Error Locations:
1. The condition `image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA'` might not handle all possible image formats and modes.
2. The `paste()` method usage might not work as intended.

### Bug Explanation:
The bug in the `convert_image()` function lies in incorrect handling of image formats and modes. The condition `image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA'` is too restrictive and may not cover all possible image formats and modes. Additionally, the usage of `background.paste(image, image)` is incorrect as `paste()` method expects a tuple position for pasting the image.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
1. Use better condition checking to handle multiple image formats and modes.
2. Correct the usage of the `paste()` method to ensure image pasting works correctly.

### Corrected Version:
Here is the corrected version of the `convert_image()` function:

```python
def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
    if image.mode != 'RGB':
        image = image.convert('RGB')
    
    if size:
        image = image.copy()
        image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)
    
    buf = BytesIO()
    image.save(buf, 'JPEG')
    return image, buf
```

In the corrected version, we removed the restrictive condition and unreliable `paste()` method usage. This version handles image conversion to RGB format correctly and generates thumbnails if a size is provided. The image is saved in JPEG format as intended.
