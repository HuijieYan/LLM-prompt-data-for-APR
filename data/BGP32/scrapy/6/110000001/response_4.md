## Analysis:
1. The `convert_image` function is within the `ImagesPipeline` class, which is a subclass of `FilesPipeline`.
2. The potential error locations are when checking the image format and mode, and when saving the image as JPEG.
3. The bug is likely caused by incorrect handling of the image format and mode, specifically when converting PNG images with RGBA mode to JPEG format.
4. To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the image is properly converted to RGB mode before saving it as a JPEG image.

## Correction:
```python
class ImagesPipeline(FilesPipeline):
    def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
        if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA':
            background = Image.new('RGB', image.size, (255, 255, 255))
            background.paste(image, image)
            image = background
        elif image.mode != 'RGB':
            image = image.convert('RGB')
    
        if size:
            image = image.copy()
            image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)
    
        buf = BytesIO()
        image.save(buf, 'JPEG')
        return image, buf
```

In the corrected version, we ensure that if the image is PNG with RGBA mode, we create a new RGB image with a white background and paste the original image on it before converting it to RGB mode. Additionally, we only save the image in JPEG format without converting it back to RGB.
