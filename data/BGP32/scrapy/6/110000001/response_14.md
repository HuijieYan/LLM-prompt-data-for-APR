## Analysis:
The `convert_image` function within the `ImagesPipeline` class is intended to convert an image to a specific format (JPEG) and return the converted image along with its corresponding BytesIO object.

## Potential Errors:
1. The condition `if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA':` might not correctly handle all PNG images with RGBA mode. 
2. The line `background.paste(image, image)` could be problematic as it pastes the original image onto itself.
3. There is a possibility of error in saving the image and specifying the format as 'JPEG' without considering the original image type.

## Cause of the Bug:
The bug in the function may occur due to incorrect handling of PNG images with RGBA mode, improper pasting of the image onto a background, and the assumption that the image should always be saved as a JPEG without considering its original format.

## Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
1. Correctly handle PNG images with RGBA mode by checking the image mode and format to ensure proper conversion.
2. Paste the image onto a new background correctly to avoid any unintended consequences.
3. Safely save the image in the specified format, taking into account the original image type.

## Corrected Version:
```python
def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
    if image.mode == 'RGBA':
        background = Image.new('RGB', image.size, (255, 255, 255))
        background.paste(image, (0, 0), image)
        image = background
    
    if size:
        image = image.copy()
        image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)

    buf = BytesIO()
    image.save(buf, image.format)
    return image, buf
```

In this corrected version:
- PNG images with RGBA mode are handled without checking the image format explicitly.
- The image is correctly pasted onto a new RGB background.
- The image is saved in its original format to maintain consistency.
