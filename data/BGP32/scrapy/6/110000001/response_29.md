## Analysis:
The buggy function `convert_image` is within the `ImagesPipeline` class and is responsible for converting images to a specific format and size. The function checks the format and mode of the image and performs conversions accordingly. However, there are potential errors in the logic of the function that need to be addressed.

## Identified errors:
1. The condition `if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA':` should check for lower case format and mode strings. It should be `if image.format.upper() == 'PNG' and image.mode.upper() == 'RGBA':`.
2. The line `background.paste(image, image)` should be corrected to `background.paste(image)`, as it only requires one image argument.
3. The `save` method in the line `image.save(buf, 'JPEG')` may cause an error if the image is not in 'JPEG' format. It should be dynamically set based on the input image format.

## Bug Cause:
The bug in the provided function is caused by incorrect comparison of image format and mode strings in uppercase, an incorrect usage of the `paste` method, and a hardcoded 'JPEG' format in the `save` method.

## Strategy for fixing the bug:
1. Convert image format and mode to uppercase for comparison.
2. Correct the `paste` method usage.
3. Dynamically set the image format for saving based on the input image's format.

## Corrected version:

```python
def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
    if image.format.upper() == 'PNG' and image.mode.upper() == 'RGBA':
        background = Image.new('RGBA', image.size, (255, 255, 255))
        background.paste(image)
        image = background.convert('RGB')
    elif image.mode != 'RGB':
        image = image.convert('RGB')

    if size:
        image = image.copy()
        image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)

    buf = BytesIO()
    # Dynamically set the image format for saving based on the input image
    image.save(buf, format=image.format)
    return image, buf
```

In the corrected version, I have addressed the identified errors and added dynamic setting of the image format for saving, ensuring compatibility with the original image format.
