## Analysis:
The function `convert_image` within the `ImagesPipeline` class is responsible for converting an image to a specified format and size. The function checks the format and mode of the image and performs conversion accordingly. There are potential error locations in the condition checks for format and mode, and the conversion process itself.

## Potential Errors:
1. The condition `if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA':` might not handle all possible variations of image formats and modes correctly.
2. The statement `background.paste(image, image)` inside the first condition may result in an error as it is trying to paste the image onto itself.
3. The conversion to RGB in the first condition may not be correct in all cases.
4. The line `image.save(buf, 'JPEG')` is hardcoding the format as JPEG, which may not be suitable for all images.

## Bug Cause:
The bug is likely caused by incorrect handling of image formats and modes, as well as the hardcoded JPEG format in the save method.

## Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
1. Update the condition to handle a broader range of image formats and modes.
2. Ensure correct handling of format conversion without errors.
3. Dynamically determine the format to save based on the input image format.

## Corrected Version:
```python
def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
    if image.mode in ['RGBA', 'P']:
        image = image.convert('RGB')
    
    if size:
        image = image.copy()
        image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)
    
    buf = BytesIO()
    image.save(buf, format=image.format if image.mode == 'RGB' else 'JPEG')
    return image, buf
``` 

In the corrected version:
- We first convert the image to RGB if the mode is RGBA or P.
- We use the original image format for saving if it's already in RGB mode, otherwise default to JPEG.
- Removed the redundant condition and paste operation as unnecessary for the conversion.
- Addressed the potential hardcoded format issue by dynamically determining the format to save the image in.
