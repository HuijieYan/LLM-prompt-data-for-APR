## Analysis:
The `convert_image` function in the `ImagesPipeline` class is attempting to convert an image to RGB format and create a thumbnail of it. However, there are a few potential error locations:
1. The condition `image.format == 'PNG'` might not be sufficient to determine the format of the input image properly.
2. The `background.paste(image, image)` statement might not be pasting the image correctly onto the background.
3. The method `image.save(buf, 'JPEG')` is saving the image in JPEG format regardless of the input image format.

## Bug Cause:
The bug in the `convert_image` function stems partly from incorrect handling of image modes and formats. The condition check for 'PNG' format and 'RGBA' mode might not properly identify images with alpha channels. Additionally, the method used to paste the image onto the background might not work as expected. Lastly, saving the image in JPEG format without considering the original format can lead to loss of image information.

## Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
1. Check for the image mode and format using the proper methods provided by the PIL library.
2. Update the logic for creating the background image and pasting the original image onto it.
3. Save the image in the format that matches the original image format to preserve image quality.

## Corrected Version:
```python
from PIL import Image
from cStringIO import StringIO as BytesIO

class ImagesPipeline(FilesPipeline):
    """
    Abstract pipeline that implements the image thumbnail generation logic
    """

    def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
        mode = image.mode
        if mode == 'RGBA':
            background = Image.new('RGB', image.size, (255, 255, 255))
            background.paste(image, (0, 0), image)
            image = background
        elif mode != 'RGB':
            image = image.convert('RGB')
        
        if size:
            image = image.copy()
            image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)
        
        buf = BytesIO()
        image.save(buf, format=image.format)
        return image, buf
```

In the corrected version:
1. We use `image.mode` to properly determine the image mode.
2. We create the background image using the 'RGB' mode and paste the original image correctly onto it.
3. We save the image using the original image format to preserve image quality.
