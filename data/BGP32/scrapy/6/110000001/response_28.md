## Analyzing the buggy function and its relationship with the buggy class
The `convert_image` function is part of the `ImagesPipeline` class, which is a subclass of `FilesPipeline`. The purpose of this function is to convert an image to a specified format and size using the PIL library. The function takes an image object and an optional size parameter as input, performs some image format and mode checks, makes necessary conversions, resizes the image if needed, and saves the image as a JPEG file.

## Potential error locations within the buggy function
1. Error in checking the image format and mode.
2. Error in the image conversion logic.
3. Error in resizing the image.
4. Error in saving the image in the correct format.

## Explanation of the bug
The bug in the `convert_image` function is in the resizing logic. When resizing the image, the function should be checking if the image's mode is RGB before performing any operations. However, the current implementation directly resizes the image without ensuring it is in RGB mode, which can lead to unexpected behavior or errors, especially when the input image has a mode other than RGB.

## Strategy for fixing the bug
To fix the bug, we need to check if the image mode is not RGB before attempting to resize it. If the mode is not RGB, convert the image to RGB mode before resizing it. This will ensure that the image is resized properly without causing any issues related to the image mode.


## Fixed version of the function
```python
def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
    if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA':
        background = Image.new('RGBA', image.size, (255, 255, 255))
        background.paste(image, image)
        image = background.convert('RGB')
    elif image.mode != 'RGB':
        image = image.convert('RGB')

    if size:
        image = image.copy()
        if image.mode != 'RGB':
            image = image.convert('RGB')
        image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)

    buf = BytesIO()
    image.save(buf, 'JPEG')
    return image, buf
```

In the corrected version of the function, we first check if the image mode is not RGB before attempting to resize the image. If the image mode is not RGB, we convert the image to RGB mode before resizing it. This ensures that the resizing operation is performed on an image in RGB mode, preventing any potential issues related to the image mode.
