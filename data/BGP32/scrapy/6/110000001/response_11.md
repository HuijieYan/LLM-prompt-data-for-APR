The buggy function `convert_image` has the following potential error locations:

1. Incorrect conditional statement for checking the image format and mode.
2. Incorrect usage of the `paste` method of the PIL library.
3. Incorrect saving format in the `image.save` method.

The cause of the bug is related to the incorrect conditional statement checking the image format and mode. The condition `image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA'` is not appropriate for checking the image format and mode. This condition may not be satisfied even for PNG images with RGBA mode, leading to incorrect image processing.

To fix the bug, we can update the conditional statement to properly check the image format and mode. 

Here is the corrected version of the `convert_image` function:

```python
def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
    if image.format == 'PNG' and 'A' in image.getbands():
        background = Image.new('RGB', image.size, (255, 255, 255))
        background.paste(image, mask=image.split()[3] if len(image.split()) > 3 else None)
        image = background
        
    if size:
        image = image.copy()
        image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)
    
    buf = BytesIO()
    image.save(buf, 'JPEG', quality=90)
    return image, buf
```

In this corrected version:
1. The condition to check if the image format is PNG and it has an alpha channel has been updated to `image.format == 'PNG' and 'A' in image.getbands()`.
2. The `paste` method is used with the `mask` parameter to correctly handle images with transparency.
3. The saving format in the `image.save` method has been updated to `'JPEG'` with a specified quality of 90.

These changes should address the bugs in the original function and improve the image conversion process.
