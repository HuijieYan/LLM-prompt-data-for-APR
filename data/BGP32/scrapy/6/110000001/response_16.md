## Analyzing the buggy function and its relationship with the buggy class

The `convert_image` function is a method within the `ImagesPipeline` class, which is supposed to convert images to a specified format and size.

## Identifying potential error locations within the buggy function

1. The condition for checking the image format is incorrect. It compares the format with 'PNG' instead of 'PNG'. This will cause the condition to never be true.
2. The method `Image.save()` expects a file path or file object to save the image, but in the buggy function, it is given a `BytesIO` object directly.

## Explaining the cause of the bug using the buggy function and the buggy class docs

The bug in the condition for checking the image format leads to incorrect conversion logic. Additionally, the incorrect usage of the `Image.save()` method with a `BytesIO` object will cause the save operation to fail.

## Suggesting a strategy for fixing the bug

1. Fix the condition for checking the image format to use 'PNG' instead of 'PNG'.
2. Use the `getvalue()` method on the `BytesIO` object to get the image data for saving.

## Corrected Version of the Function

```python
class ImagesPipeline(FilesPipeline):
    """
    Abstract pipeline that implements the image thumbnail generation logic
    """

    def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
        if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA':
            background = Image.new('RGBA', image.size, (255, 255, 255))
            background.paste(image, image)
            image = background.convert('RGB')
        elif image.mode != 'RGB':
            image = image.convert('RGB')
    
        if size:
            image = image.copy()
            image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)
    
        buf = BytesIO()
        image.save(buf, format='JPEG')
        return image, buf.getvalue()
```

In the corrected version:
1. The condition for checking the image format is fixed to compare with 'PNG'.
2. The `BytesIO` object is used with the `getvalue()` method to retrieve the image data for saving.
