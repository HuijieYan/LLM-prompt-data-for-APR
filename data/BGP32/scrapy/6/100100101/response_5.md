### Analysis:
The buggy function is supposed to convert images to RGB format and save them as JPEG files. However, there are a few issues in the function:
- When dealing with PNG images in RGBA mode, the function incorrectly creates a new RGBA background, pastes the original image over it, and converts it to RGB. This process doesn't maintain the transparency effectively.
- When the input image is not in RGB mode, the function converts it directly to RGB, which can lead to data loss if the image has additional channels (e.g., alpha channel).

### Bug Explanation:
In the failing test case, the first issue becomes apparent when the function is called with a PNG image in RGBA mode. The function creates a white background, pastes the original image over it, and converts it to RGB. However, this process does not preserve the transparency of the original image, resulting in incorrect colors.

### Bug Fix:
To fix the bug, we should modify the function to handle the conversion of PNG images with transparency properly. Below is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
    if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA':
        image = image.convert('RGBA')
        background = Image.new('RGB', image.size, (255, 255, 255))
        background.paste(image, image)
        image = background
    elif image.mode != 'RGB':
        image = image.convert('RGB')

    if size:
        image = image.copy()
        image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)

    buf = BytesIO()
    image.save(buf, 'JPEG')
    return image, buf
```

This corrected version ensures that when dealing with PNG images in RGBA mode, we correctly handle transparency by converting the image to RGBA format before processing it with a white background. This way, transparency is preserved during the conversion process.
