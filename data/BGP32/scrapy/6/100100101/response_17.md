### Bug Analysis:
The bug in the `convert_image` function lies in the condition where it checks if the input image's format is `'PNG'` and mode is `'RGBA'` to decide whether to create a new background and convert the image to RGB. However, when pasting the original image onto the new background, the `paste` method seems to be causing the issue. It should be using the `RGBA` image as the source and not the destination image.

### Bug Cause:
The bug causes the `ConvertImageTest` test case to fail because when a PNG image with RGBA mode is encountered, the original image is pasted onto the new background incorrectly, resulting in a loss of transparency and incorrect color representation in the output image.

### Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to correct the condition where the image format is `'PNG'` and the mode is `'RGBA'`. When creating the new background, the original image should be pasted onto the new background as the source image, not the destination image.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
    if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA':
        background = Image.new('RGBA', image.size, (255, 255, 255))
        background.paste(image, mask=image)  # Corrected the paste call
        image = background.convert('RGB')
    elif image.mode != 'RGB':
        image = image.convert('RGB')

    if size:
        image = image.copy()
        image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)

    buf = BytesIO()
    image.save(buf, 'JPEG')
    return image, buf
``` 

By making the modification to the paste call from `background.paste(image, image)` to `background.paste(image, mask=image)`, we correctly paste the original image onto the new background. This change ensures that the transparency of the original image is preserved, leading to the correct color representation in the output image.
