### Analyzing the Buggy Function
The buggy function `convert_image` is designed to handle image conversions and thumbnail resizing. The function checks the image format and mode and then performs specific operations accordingly. There are potential issues in the code related to handling PNG images with RGBA mode, RGB mode conversion, and thumbnail resizing.

### Identifying Potential Error Locations
1. The condition for PNG images with RGBA mode may not be handled correctly.
2. The conversion to RGB mode might be incorrect.
3. Thumbnail resizing could lead to unexpected results.

### Explanation of the Bug
The bug occurs when the function processes PNG images with RGBA mode and tries to convert them to RGB mode. The code does not handle this conversion properly, leading to unexpected colors and possibly losing the alpha channel information. Additionally, the thumbnail resizing might not preserve the image ratio as expected.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug
1. Make sure to handle PNG images with RGBA mode correctly, preserving the alpha channel if needed.
2. Correctly convert images to RGB mode when necessary.
3. Ensure that thumbnail resizing maintains the image ratio.

### Corrected Version of the Function
```python
def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
    if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA':
        background = Image.new('RGBA', image.size, (255, 255, 255))
        background.paste(image, (0, 0), image)
        image = background.convert('RGB')
    elif image.mode != 'RGB':
        image = image.convert('RGB')

    if size:
        image = image.copy()
        image.thumbnail(size, resample=Image.ANTIALIAS)

    buf = BytesIO()
    image.save(buf, 'JPEG')
    return image, buf
```

In the corrected version, the code now correctly handles PNG images with RGBA mode by pasting the image onto a white background before converting it to RGB mode. The thumbnail resizing now uses the `resample` parameter with `Image.ANTIALIAS` to maintain image quality. These adjustments should address the issues identified in the buggy function.
