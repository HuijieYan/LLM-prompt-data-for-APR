The bug in the `convert_image` function is related to incorrectly handling PNG images with RGBA mode. The code attempts to convert PNG images with RGBA mode to RGB format by creating a new RGBA background with white color and pasting the original image onto it. However, the `paste` method should be used with the `image` as the second argument, not with itself. This results in an incorrect conversion of the image.

To fix this bug, the code needs to be modified so that the `paste` method is correctly used with the `image` as the second argument.

Here is the corrected version of the `convert_image` function:

```python
# The corrected version of the buggy function
def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
    if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA':
        background = Image.new('RGBA', image.size, (255, 255, 255))
        background.paste(image, (0, 0), image)
        image = background.convert('RGB')
    elif image.mode != 'RGB':
        image = image.convert('RGB')

    if size:
        image = image.copy()
        image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)

    buf = BytesIO()
    image.save(buf, 'JPEG')
    return image, buf
```

This corrected version should now properly handle PNG images with RGBA mode and correctly convert them to RGB format, passing all the test cases provided.
