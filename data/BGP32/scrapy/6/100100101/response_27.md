After analyzing the buggy function and the failing test, we can identify the potential error locations:
1. In the condition checking for PNG format and RGBA mode. The method `paste()` should be used with `background` as the first argument and `image` as the second argument, but it's currently the opposite.
2. In the condition checking for transparency (RGBA mode). The conversion of the image to RGB should consider the transparency by using a white background image.

The cause of the bug is mainly due to incorrect handling of image modes and formats, leading to incorrect conversions and pasting.

To fix the bug, we need to:
1. Correct the `paste()` call in the PNG format and RGBA mode condition.
2. Handle transparency correctly by creating a white background image with RGBA mode before pasting the original image.
3. Ensure that the conversion to RGB in the transparency condition considers the transparency.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
    if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA':
        background = Image.new('RGBA', image.size, (255, 255, 255, 255))
        background.paste(image, (0, 0), image)
        image = background.convert('RGB')
    elif image.mode != 'RGB':
        image = image.convert('RGB')

    if size:
        image = image.copy()
        image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)

    buf = BytesIO()
    image.save(buf, 'JPEG')
    return image, buf
```

This corrected version addresses the issues in the original function and should pass the failing test cases while satisfying the expected input/output values.
