### Analysis:
The buggy function `convert_image` is meant to process an input image by converting it to RGB mode and resizing if a size is provided. There are a few issues with the function that are causing it to fail the provided test cases:
1. The conditional check for RGBA images in the first `if` statement is incorrect, it checks for PNG format instead of RGBA mode.
2. The background image is pasted incorrectly in RGBA image conversion.
3. The method used to save the image as JPEG is incorrect.

### Bug Explanation:
In the failing test case, when converting an image from RGBA mode to RGB mode, the function incorrectly checks for the PNG format instead of the RGBA mode. This results in incorrect handling of RGBA images and leads to failing assertions in the test cases.

### Bug Fix:
To fix the bug, we need to correct the conditional check for RGBA mode, properly paste the background in RGBA image conversion, and use the correct method to save the image as JPEG.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
    if image.mode == 'RGBA':
        background = Image.new('RGBA', image.size, (255, 255, 255))
        background.paste(image, (0, 0), image)
        image = background.convert('RGB')
    elif image.mode != 'RGB':
        image = image.convert('RGB')

    if size:
        image = image.copy()
        image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)

    buf = BytesIO()
    image.save(buf, format='JPEG')
    return image, buf
``` 

After applying these corrections, the function should now pass the failing test cases and correctly handle the conversion and resizing of images.
