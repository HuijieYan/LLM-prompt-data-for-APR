## Analysis
The buggy function is designed to handle different image formats and modes and convert them to RGB mode. However, there are some issues in the implementation that cause the function to fail the provided test cases. The main issues are:
1. In the first condition, the code mistakenly creates a new RGBA image as a background and tries to paste the original RGBA image on it. This should be corrected to paste the original RGBA image on a white RGB background.
2. The function does not handle the case where the input image is already in RGB mode, leading to unnecessary conversion.
3. The function does not correctly handle the thumbnail creation for images with specified sizes.

## Bug Explanation
In the failing test cases:
1. In Case 1, the function incorrectly creates a new RGBA background, pastes the original image, and then converts it to RGB. However, it should only create a white RGB background and paste the original RGBA image on it.
2. In Case 2, the function should resize the image to (10,10) as specified, but it does not correctly handle the thumbnail creation process.
3. In Case 3, the function incorrectly converts the RGBA image to RGB without handling transparency giving incorrect output.
4. In Case 4, the function should keep the palette mode image as is and just convert it to RGB, but it incorrectly tries to create a RGBA background.

## Strategy for Fixing the Bug
1. Fix the condition that handles RGBA images to correctly paste the image on a white RGB background and then convert it to RGB.
2. Check if the image is already in RGB mode and skip the unnecessary conversion.
3. Update the thumbnail creation process to handle specified sizes correctly.
4. Ensure that transparency in RGBA images is appropriately handled during conversion.

## Corrected Version of the Function
```python
def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
    if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA':
        background = Image.new('RGB', image.size, (255, 255, 255))
        background.paste(image, (0, 0), image)
        image = background.convert('RGB')
    elif image.mode != 'RGB':
        image = image.convert('RGB')

    if size:
        image = image.copy()
        image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)

    buf = BytesIO()
    image.save(buf, 'JPEG')
    return image, buf
