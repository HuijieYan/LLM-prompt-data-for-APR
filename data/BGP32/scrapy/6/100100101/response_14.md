### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `convert_image` takes an image as input and processes it based on its format and mode.
2. The function attempts to handle PNG images with RGBA mode by converting them to RGB mode with a white background. However, there is an issue with this logic.
3. The bug occurs when trying to process PNG images with RGBA mode. The function incorrectly handles the background creation and pasting operation, resulting in an incorrect output image.
4. To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the background creation and pasting operation for PNG images with RGBA mode is corrected.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Update the logic for handling PNG images with RGBA mode to correctly create a white background and paste the original image onto it before converting to RGB mode.
  
### Corrected Function:
```python
def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
    if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA':
        background = Image.new('RGBA', image.size, (255, 255, 255, 255))  # Fix: Include alpha channel in the background color
        background.paste(image, (0, 0), image)  # Fix: Specify the position to paste the image
        image = background.convert('RGB')
    elif image.mode != 'RGB':
        image = image.convert('RGB')

    if size:
        image = image.copy()
        image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)

    buf = BytesIO()
    image.save(buf, 'JPEG')
    return image, buf
```

By correcting the background creation and pasting operation for PNG images with RGBA mode, the `convert_image` function should now produce the expected output for all test cases.
