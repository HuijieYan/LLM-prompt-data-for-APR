### Analysis:
The buggy function `convert_image` has a condition to handle PNG images with RGBA mode by converting them to RGB format. The bug occurs in this condition where the `paste` function is incorrectly used causing the function to not handle transparency correctly. This results in an incorrect conversion of RGBA to RGB images.

### Bug cause:
The bug arises due to the incorrect usage of the `paste` method which does not blend the RGBA image with a white background correctly. As a result, the conversion from RGBA to RGB loses transparency information, leading to incorrect outputs for images with transparency.

### Bug fix strategy:
To fix the bug, the `paste` method should be used correctly to blend the RGBA image with a white background, preserving transparency. Additionally, the JPEG saving should account for images with different formats and modes properly.

### Corrected version of the function:
```python
def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
    if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA':
        background = Image.new('RGBA', image.size, (255, 255, 255, 255))
        background.paste(image, (0, 0), image)
        image = background.convert('RGB')
    elif image.mode != 'RGB':
        image = image.convert('RGB')

    if size:
        image = image.copy()
        image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)

    buf = BytesIO()
    if image.mode == 'RGB':
        image.save(buf, 'JPEG')
    elif image.mode == 'P':
        image.save(buf, 'PNG')
    return image, buf
```

By updating the `paste` function to blend the RGBA image correctly and ensuring that the image saving format matches the image mode, the corrected function should now handle image conversions properly. This fix should address the transparency issues and match the expected output for the failing test cases.
