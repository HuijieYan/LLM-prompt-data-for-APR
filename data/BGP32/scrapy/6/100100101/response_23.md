### Analysis:
The buggy function `convert_image` is designed to take an image and convert it to RGB mode, resizing it if a size parameter is provided. The bug arises from the incorrect handling of PNG images with RGBA mode. The function incorrectly converts PNG images with RGBA mode to RGB mode without properly handling transparency information.

### Bug Cause:
1. The bug arises when the condition `if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA':` is met. In this case, the function creates a new RGBA mode image filled with white (background) and pastes the original image on top of it, losing the alpha channel information. Then it converts the combined image to RGB mode, which results in loss of transparency.

### Bug Fix:
To fix the bug, we need to modify the handling of PNG images with RGBA mode. We should properly handle transparency during the conversion process.

### Corrected Function:
```python
def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
    if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA':
        new_img = Image.new('RGBA', image.size, (255, 255, 255, 255))
        new_img.paste(image, (0, 0), image)
        image = new_img
    elif image.mode != 'RGB':
        image = image.convert('RGB')

    if size:
        image = image.copy()
        image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)

    buf = BytesIO()
    image.save(buf, 'JPEG')
    return image, buf
```

By pasting the RGBA image on top of a new RGBA image filled with white, we can maintain transparency information during the conversion. This corrected version of the function should now pass the failing test cases while handling PNG images with RGBA mode appropriately.
