### Error Location:
The bug is located in the condition that checks if the input image format is 'PNG' and the mode is 'RGBA'. The background image is created as an RGBA image, but then it is pasted with an RGBA image itself, resulting in an incorrect conversion to RGB.

### Bug Explanation:
When the input image format is 'PNG' and the mode is 'RGBA', the function creates a background image as RGBA and then pastes the input image onto it. This operation causes the background to also have RGBA channels. Subsequently, when converting the background to RGB, the RGBA channels are still present, leading to an incorrect conversion.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to paste the input image onto the background without creating additional RGBA layers. This can be achieved by using the `background.paste(image, (0, 0), image)` method, which pastes the input image at position (0, 0) without trying to decompose it.

### Corrected Version:
```python
from PIL import Image
from cStringIO import StringIO as BytesIO

def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
    if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA':
        background = Image.new('RGB', image.size, (255, 255, 255)) 
        background.paste(image, (0, 0), image)
        image = background
    elif image.mode != 'RGB':
        image = image.convert('RGB')

    if size:
        image = image.copy()
        image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)

    buf = BytesIO()
    image.save(buf, 'JPEG')
    return image, buf
``` 

By using the corrected version of the function, the bug should be fixed and the function should now pass all the test cases provided.
