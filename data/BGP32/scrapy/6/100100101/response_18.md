The bug in the `convert_image` function is related to the condition for handling PNG images with RGBA mode. The bug causes transparency to be lost when converting such images to JPEG format.

### Cause of the bug:
When the function encounters a PNG image with RGBA mode, it creates a new RGBA background and then pastes the original image on that background. However, when doing so, it incorrectly uses `background.paste(image, image)`, which leads to the loss of transparency in the resulting image.

### Strategy for fixing the bug:
To fix the bug, we need to correctly paste the original image on the background while retaining transparency. We can achieve this by using the `background.paste(image, None, image)` function instead.

### Corrected version of the function:
```python
def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
    if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA':
        background = Image.new('RGBA', image.size, (255, 255, 255, 255))
        background.paste(image, None, image)
        image = background.convert('RGB')
    elif image.mode != 'RGB':
        image = image.convert('RGB')

    if size:
        image = image.copy()
        image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)

    buf = BytesIO()
    image.save(buf, 'JPEG')
    return image, buf
```

By correcting the `paste` function call to use `None` as the second parameter, we ensure that transparency is preserved when pasting the original image onto the background. This corrected version of the function should now pass the failing test cases provided.
