### Analyzing the buggy function
The buggy function `convert_image` is responsible for converting images to RGB format and saving them as JPEG files. The function also handles resizing images if a `size` parameter is provided. 

### Identifying potential error locations
1. The conversion of an RGBA image to RGB by pasting it on a new RGBA background and then converting it to RGB might cause unexpected color changes.
2. Resizing images without maintaining the aspect ratio might result in distorted images.
3. Saving all images as JPEG without considering the original format can lead to loss of quality or transparency.

### Explaining the cause of the bug
1. When dealing with RGBA images, pasting the image on a white background before converting it to RGB could alter the colors since the background will also be included in the final image.
2. Attempting to resize images without preserving their aspect ratio can result in incorrectly sized and distorted images.
3. Saving all images as JPEG without checking the original format can cause loss of transparency or quality issues.

### Suggesting a strategy for fixing the bug
1. We should directly convert RGBA images to RGB without pasting them on a new background.
2. Before resizing an image, we should ensure the aspect ratio is maintained.
3. We should determine the appropriate image format for saving based on the original format of the image.

### Corrected version of the function
```python
def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
    if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA':
        image = image.convert('RGB')  # Directly convert RGBA to RGB

    if size:
        image = image.copy()
        image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)

    buf = BytesIO()
    if image.format == 'PNG':  # Check original format for saving
        image.save(buf, 'PNG')
    else:
        image.save(buf, 'JPEG')

    return image, buf
``` 

By making these changes, we ensure that RGBA images are directly converted to RGB, maintain the aspect ratio while resizing, and save images in their original format.
