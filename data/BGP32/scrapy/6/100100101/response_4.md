### Analysis:
1. The buggy function takes an image as input and performs certain conversions based on the image format and mode.
2. The bug seems to be related to the condition for handling RGBA images with PNG format.
3. In the failing test case where the input image is RGBA with PNG format, the buggy function is expected to convert it to RGB format. However, the conversion logic inside the first condition block seems incorrect.
4. To fix the bug, we need to correctly handle the conversion of RGBA images with PNG format to RGB format.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is caused by the incorrect handling of RGBA images with PNG format inside the first condition block of the `convert_image` function. The logic used to convert such images to RGB format is flawed, resulting in an incorrect output.

### Bug Fix:
We need to update the logic for converting RGBA images with PNG format to RGB format in a way that preserves transparency and color information correctly. Here is the corrected version of the `convert_image` function:

```python
def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
    if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA':
        # Create a new image with a white background
        background = Image.new('RGBA', image.size, (255, 255, 255, 255))
        # Composite the input RGBA image onto the new background
        background.paste(image, (0, 0), image)
        # Convert the composite image to RGB format
        image = background.convert('RGB')
    elif image.mode != 'RGB':
        image = image.convert('RGB')

    if size:
        image = image.copy()
        image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)

    buf = BytesIO()
    image.save(buf, 'JPEG')
    return image, buf
```

By correctly compositing the RGBA image onto a new RGBA image with a white background before converting it to RGB, we preserve the transparency information while converting the image format.

After applying this fix, the `convert_image` function should now successfully handle RGBA images with PNG format and produce the expected output for all test cases.
