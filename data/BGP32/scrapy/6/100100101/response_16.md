The buggy function `convert_image` has several issues that need to be addressed. 

1. The condition `if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA':` is incorrect, as an image can be in RGBA mode without being a PNG format. 
2. When creating the `background` image, the `paste` method should take the `background` image as the first argument and the `image` to paste as the second argument.

To fix the bug, we need to adjust the conditional statement and the way the `image` is pasted onto the `background` image. Here is the corrected version of the `convert_image` function:

```python
def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
    if image.mode == 'RGBA':
        background = Image.new('RGBA', image.size, (255, 255, 255))
        background.paste(image, (0, 0), image)
        image = background.convert('RGB')
    elif image.mode != 'RGB':
        image = image.convert('RGB')

    if size:
        image = image.copy()
        image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)

    buf = BytesIO()
    image.save(buf, 'JPEG')
    return image, buf
```

With these changes, the function should now handle the different image modes and formats correctly. This corrected version should pass the failing test cases provided.
