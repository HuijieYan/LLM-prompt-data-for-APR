### Analysis:
The buggy function is intended to convert images to RGB format and resize them if a size parameter is provided. The bug occurs when the input image format is PNG and mode is RGBA, causing the function to incorrectly convert it to RGB format. The issue lies in the way the image is pasted onto the background in the PNG and RGBA case, resulting in a loss of transparency and incorrect conversion.

### Bug Explanation:
In the buggy function, when the input image format is PNG and mode is RGBA, a new RGBA background image is created with white color. This background image is then pasted with the original image using `background.paste(image, image)`, which results in a loss of transparency and incorrect conversion to RGB. This leads to the failing test cases where transparency is not preserved in the converted image.

### Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, the alpha channel transparency needs to be preserved when converting PNG images from RGBA to RGB format. This can be achieved by creating a new RGBA background image and pasting the original image without losing transparency. Additionally, the conversion of images to RGB format should handle RGBA images correctly by preserving the alpha channel.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
    if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA':
        background = Image.new('RGBA', image.size, (255, 255, 255, 255))
        background.paste(image, (0, 0), image)
        image = background.convert('RGB')
    elif image.mode != 'RGB':
        image = image.convert('RGB')

    if size:
        image = image.copy()
        image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)

    buf = BytesIO()
    image.save(buf, 'JPEG')
    return image, buf
```

By correcting the pasting of the image onto the background and ensuring that alpha channel transparency is preserved during the conversion, the fixed function should now pass the failing test cases and maintain the expected input/output values.
