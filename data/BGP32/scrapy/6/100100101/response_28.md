### Analysis:
The buggy function `convert_image` is designed to handle different types of images and convert them to RGB format. It also includes functionality to resize the image if a size parameter is provided. However, there are some errors in the code logic that lead to incorrect conversions and failures in the test cases.

### Error Location:
1. The check for `PNG` format images with `RGBA` mode tries to create a new `RGBA` background image and pastes the original image onto it, but the `paste` function call is incorrect. It should be `background.paste(image, (0, 0))` instead of `background.paste(image, image)`.
2. In the same `if` condition for `PNG` format images with `RGBA` mode, the final conversion to `RGB` is incorrect. It should handle the transparency properly.
3. The handling of image mode in the section converting non-`RGB` mode images is not ideal and may result in unexpected behavior.

### Bug Explanation:
In the failing test, the `convert_image` function fails to properly convert images in the `PNG` format with `RGBA` mode to `RGB`. It incorrectly pastes the image onto a background and converts it, leading to incorrect color values and failures in the test cases.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
1. Fix the `paste` function call in the `PNG` format and `RGBA` mode section to paste the image correctly onto the background.
2. Update the conversion process for `PNG` format with `RGBA` mode images to handle transparency properly.
3. Enhance the handling of different image modes to ensure correct conversions.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
    if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA':
        background = Image.new('RGBA', image.size, (255, 255, 255))
        background.paste(image, (0, 0))  # Fix the paste function call
        image = background.convert('RGBA').convert('RGB')  # Handle transparency correctly
    elif image.mode != 'RGB':
        image = image.convert('RGB')

    if size:
        image = image.copy()
        image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)

    buf = BytesIO()
    image.save(buf, 'JPEG')
    return image, buf
```

By making the above corrections in the `convert_image` function, it should now pass the failing test cases and properly handle the conversion of images as expected.
