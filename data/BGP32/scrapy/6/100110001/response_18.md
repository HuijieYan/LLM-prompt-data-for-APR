### Analysis:
- The buggy function `convert_image` is expected to convert an image to RGB mode and save it in JPEG format. It also allows resizing the image if a `size` parameter is provided.
- The failing test `test_convert_image` checks the conversion of multiple types of images with different modes and sizes.
- The error message indicates a failure in asserting the colors of the converted images after a series of operations.

### Potential Error Locations:
1. Incorrect handling of image mode and format during conversion.
2. Issue with resizing and maintaining image ratio.
3. Incorrect saving of image in JPEG format.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is likely caused by incorrect conversion and handling of images during the transformation process, possibly resulting in a mismatch of colors and modes in the output.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
1. Ensure proper conversion to RGB mode for all input images.
2. Handle image resizing while maintaining the aspect ratio.
3. Correctly save the modified image in JPEG format.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
    if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA':
        background = Image.new('RGBA', image.size, (255, 255, 255))
        background.paste(image, (0, 0), image)
        image = background.convert('RGB')
    elif image.mode != 'RGB':
        image = image.convert('RGB')

    if size:
        new_size = image.size
        new_size = (size[0], int((size[0] / image.size[0]) * image.size[1]))
        image = image.resize(new_size, Image.ANTIALIAS)

    buf = BytesIO()
    image.save(buf, 'JPEG')
    return image, buf
```

### Proposed Changes:
1. In the RGBA to RGB conversion, use proper pasting of the image on the background.
2. When resizing the image, calculate the new height proportionally to maintain the aspect ratio.
3. Correctly resize the image and save it in JPEG format.

By applying these changes, the corrected function should now pass the failing test.
