### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `convert_image` is used to convert an image to JPEG format and resize it if needed. 
2. The failing test `test_convert_image` checks various scenarios involving image formats and sizes.
3. The error occurs when the test is comparing the colors of the converted images, specifically in the case of RGBA and PNG formats.
4. The bug seems to be related to the color values not being properly handled during format conversion.

### Bug:
The bug is related to the incorrect handling of image colors during conversion, leading to a mismatch in the color values in the converted images.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
1. Check the conditions for handling RGBA images and ensure that transparency is properly accounted for.
2. Verify the color conversion logic, especially when converting RGBA images to RGB.
3. Make sure that the color matching in the test cases aligns with the expected behavior after conversion.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
    if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA':
        background = Image.new('RGBA', image.size, (255, 255, 255, 255))
        background.paste(image, (0, 0), image)
        image = background.convert('RGB')
    elif image.mode != 'RGB':
        image = image.convert('RGB')

    if size:
        image = image.copy()
        image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)

    buf = BytesIO()
    image.save(buf, 'JPEG')
    return image, buf
```

### Explanation of Changes:
1. Added an additional alpha channel with full transparency to the background when pasting the RGBA image onto it to retain transparency.
2. Adjusted the position argument for pasting the image onto the background to avoid errors.
3. Corrected the RGBA to RGB conversion logic to handle transparency properly.
