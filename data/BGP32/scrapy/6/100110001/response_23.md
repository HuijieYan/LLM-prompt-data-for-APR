## Analysis:
1. The function `convert_image` is supposed to take an image object and convert it to a different format and size if specified.
2. The error message indicates that the test is failing because the colors of the converted image are not matching the expected colors.
3. The bug seems to be related to the conversion and manipulation of images within the function.
   
## Bug:
The bug lies in how the RGBA image with transparency is converted to RGB. The bug is in the `convert_image` function where it converts PNG RGBA image to RGB.

## Fix:
In order to fix this bug, we need to handle the conversion of RGBA images properly to ensure that transparency is preserved during the conversion to RGB. One way to do this is to separate the alpha channel before conversion to RGB.

## Corrected Function:
```python
def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
    if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA':
        r, g, b, a = image.split()
        background = Image.new('RGBA', image.size, (255, 255, 255))
        background.paste(image, (0, 0), mask=a)
        image = background.convert('RGB')
    elif image.mode != 'RGB':
        image = image.convert('RGB')

    if size:
        image = image.copy()
        image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)

    buf = BytesIO()
    image.save(buf, 'JPEG')
    return image, buf
```

After this fix, the function should properly convert RGBA images to RGB while preserving transparency. This should ensure that the failing test for RGBA to RGB conversion passes successfully.
