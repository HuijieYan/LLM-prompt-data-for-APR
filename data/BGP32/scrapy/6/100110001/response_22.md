### Analysis:
- The buggy function `convert_image` is designed to process images, convert them to different formats if necessary, and resize them if specified.
- The failing test `test_convert_image` checks the behavior of the function for different scenarios involving images with different modes and sizes.
- The error message indicates a discrepancy in the color values after conversion for a particular case.
- The bug seems to be related to the handling of transparency, especially when converting RGBA images to RGB.

### Issue:
The bug arises from the incorrect handling of RGBA images when converting them to RGB. The alpha channel is affecting the final color values, causing the discrepancy in the test.

### Solution:
To address the bug:
1. Ensure that the transparency of RGBA images is handled correctly when converting to RGB.
2. Take into account the transparency information to calculate the final RGB color values accurately.

### Updated Function:
```python
def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
    if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA':
        background = Image.new('RGB', image.size, (255, 255, 255))
        background.paste(image, (0, 0), image)
        image = background
    elif image.mode != 'RGB':
        image = image.convert('RGB')

    if size:
        image = image.copy()
        image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)

    buf = BytesIO()
    image.save(buf, 'JPEG')
    return image, buf
```

### Explanation:
- In the updated function:
  - When dealing with PNG RGBA images, a new RGB background image is created to handle transparency.
  - The RGBA image is then pasted onto the RGB background, taking into account the alpha channel properly.
  - The conversion to RGB is now handled correctly, ensuring that the color values are accurate.
- By correcting the handling of transparency during the conversion process, the function should now pass the failing test and produce the expected results.
