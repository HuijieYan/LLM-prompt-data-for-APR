### Analysis:
1. The `convert_image` function is designed to take an image and convert it to RGB format if it's not already in RGB format. It also provides the option to resize the image using the `thumbnail` method. Finally, it saves the converted image as a JPEG and returns both the image and its byte representation.
2. The buggy part of the function seems to be the condition checking for PNG format and RGBA mode. The image conversion process in this condition is incorrect, as it is pasting the image onto a white background but not accounting for the transparency channel properly.
3. The failing test is checking for the colors in the converted image after transparency. The error message indicates a mismatch in expected and actual colors due to the buggy conversion process.
4. To fix the bug, the transparency channel of the image needs to be taken into consideration correctly when converting from PNG RGBA to JPEG RGB format.
5. The correction involves correctly handling the transparency channel during conversion, so the final result represents the original image accurately after conversion.

### Updated Corrected Function:
```python
def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
    if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA':
        background = Image.new('RGBA', image.size, (255, 255, 255, 255))  # Ensure full opacity in the background
        background.paste(image, (0, 0), mask=image)  # Paste with the image as a mask to preserve transparency
        image = background.convert('RGB')
    elif image.mode != 'RGB':
        image = image.convert('RGB')

    if size:
        image = image.copy()
        image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)

    buf = BytesIO()
    image.save(buf, 'JPEG')
    return image, buf
```

By correctly using the mask parameter in the `paste` method and ensuring that the background created for transparency includes full opacity, we can accurately convert PNG images with transparency to JPEG format while preserving the original appearance.
