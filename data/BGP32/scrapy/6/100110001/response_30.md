### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `convert_image` is responsible for converting images to the desired format and size.
2. The failing test `test_convert_image` checks various cases including RGB to JPEG conversion and RGBA to RGB conversion.
3. The error message indicates a failure in comparing the expected colors after conversion.
4. The bug might be related to the conversion process altering the colors of the images.

### Bug:
The bug arises due to incorrect handling of transparency in the images during conversion. The conversion process does not handle transparency correctly, leading to color differences in the output image.

### Fix:
To fix the bug, we need to properly handle the transparency channel in RGBA images during conversion.

### Corrected Code:
```python
def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
    if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA':
        background = Image.new('RGBA', image.size, (255, 255, 255, 255))
        background.paste(image, image)
        image = background.convert('RGB')
    elif image.mode != 'RGB':
        image = image.convert('RGB')

    if size:
        image = image.copy()
        image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)

    buf = BytesIO()
    if image.mode == 'RGBA':
        image = image.convert('RGB')  # Convert RGBA images to RGB before saving as JPEG
    image.save(buf, 'JPEG')

    return image, buf
```

By handling transparency channels properly and converting RGBA images to RGB before saving as JPEG, we ensure that the colors are preserved correctly during conversion. This corrected code should pass the failing test successfully.
