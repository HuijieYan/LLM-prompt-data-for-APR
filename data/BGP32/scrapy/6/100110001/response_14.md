### Analysis:
The buggy function `convert_image` has issues with handling PNG images with RGBA mode. Specifically, it fails to properly convert RGBA PNG images into RGB JPEG images, resulting in a mismatch in colors during the test.

### Potential Error Locations:
1. The condition checking for PNG and RGBA format may not be correctly converting the image.
2. There might be an issue with pasting the image onto a new RGBA background.
3. The final conversion to RGB might be incorrect for certain image modes.

### Cause of the Bug:
The bug is caused by the incorrect handling of PNG images with RGBA mode. When the function encounters such images, it tries to convert them into RGB mode, but the conversion process is flawed, leading to a difference in colors between the original and converted images.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
1. Ensure that the conversion process for PNG images with RGBA mode is correctly implemented.
2. Check the pasting operation on the background image to make sure it retains the original image's colors.
3. Validate the final conversion to RGB mode to accurately represent the image colors.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
    if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA':
        background = Image.new('RGBA', image.size, (255, 255, 255, 255))
        background.paste(image, (0, 0), image)
        image = background.convert('RGB')
    
    elif image.mode != 'RGB':
        image = image.convert('RGB')

    if size:
        image = image.copy()
        image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)

    buf = BytesIO()
    image.save(buf, 'JPEG')
    return image, buf
```

With the above corrections, the `convert_image` function should now properly handle PNG images with RGBA mode and convert them to RGB mode for JPEG images. This should resolve the color mismatch issue seen in the failing test.
