### Analysis:
The buggy function `convert_image` is expected to convert images to RGB format and generate thumbnails if a size is provided. The issue arises when dealing with PNG images in RGBA mode. In the buggy code, there is a check to convert PNG images in RGBA mode to RGB format by creating a new transparent RGBA background, pasting the original image on it, and then converting the entire image to RGB. However, this process is incorrect and leads to an incorrect conversion result, as indicated by the failing test.

### Bug Explanation:
1. The buggy function tries to convert PNG images in RGBA mode to RGB format by pasting the original image on a new RGBA background with white color but fails to handle transparency correctly.
2. As a result, the converted image loses its intended transparency and does not match the expected colors in the failing test. 

### Fix Strategy:
1. Instead of creating a new RGBA image as a background and then converting the whole image to RGB, handle the transparency correctly during the conversion process.
2. To correctly handle transparency, convert the PNG images in RGBA mode to RGB format by blending them with a white background using the `Image.alpha_composite` method provided by the Pillow library.

### Corrected Version:
```python
# Corrected version of the function
def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
    if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA':
        background = Image.new('RGBA', image.size, (255, 255, 255, 255))
        image = Image.alpha_composite(background, image)
        image = image.convert('RGB')
    elif image.mode != 'RGB':
        image = image.convert('RGB')

    if size:
        image = image.copy()
        image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)

    buf = BytesIO()
    image.save(buf, 'JPEG')
    return image, buf
```

After applying these changes and running the failing test, the corrected function should pass the test successfully.
