### Analysis:
- The buggy function `convert_image` in `scrapy/pipelines/images.py` is supposed to handle image conversion and resizing.
- The failing test `test_convert_image` in `tests/test_pipeline_images.py` checks the functionality of the `convert_image` function for different image types and sizes.
- The error message indicates a mismatch in the colors of the converted images, specifically failing the assertion on `converted.getcolors()`.
- The bug seems to be related to the color channel conversion while handling transparency in PNG images.

### Bug Location:
- The bug is likely in the part of the function that deals with PNG images with transparency (mode 'RGBA') and converting them to RGB.

### Cause of the Bug:
- The function currently does not handle the transparency channel correctly when converting PNG images with alpha channel to RGB format. This results in incorrect color values in the converted images, leading to the failing test.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
- Update the code to properly handle the conversion of PNG images with transparency to ensure that the alpha channel is correctly accounted for during the conversion to RGB.
- It is crucial to retain the transparency information when converting from RGBA to RGB.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
    if image.format == 'PNG':
        if image.mode == 'RGBA':
            background = Image.new('RGBA', image.size, (255, 255, 255))
            background.paste(image, image)
            image = background.convert('RGBA').convert('RGB')
        elif image.mode == 'P':
            image = image.convert('RGBA').convert('RGB')
    else:
        if image.mode != 'RGB':
            image = image.convert('RGB')

    if size:
        image = image.copy()
        image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)

    buf = BytesIO()
    image.save(buf, 'JPEG')
    return image, buf
```

By updating the conversion logic to correctly handle PNG images with transparency, the corrected version should address the bug and ensure that the failing test `test_convert_image` passes successfully.
