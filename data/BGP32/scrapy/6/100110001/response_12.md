### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `convert_image` is supposed to convert images to a specified format and size, handling different scenarios like transparency and color modes.
2. The failing test is specifically checking for the conversion of an image with RGBA mode and PNG format, ensuring that the conversion results in RGB mode with correct colors.
3. The error message indicates that the test is failing because the colors in the converted image are not matching the expected values.
4. The bug in the function might be related to the conversion logic for RGBA images to RGB mode.
5. The function does not correctly handle the conversion of RGBA images to RGB mode while pasting it on a new background.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Ensure that when dealing with RGBA images, the alpha channel is properly handled during the conversion to RGB mode.
2. Use appropriate methods from the Pillow library to handle transparency issues.
3. Verify that the colors are accurately maintained during the conversion process.

### Corrected Code:
```python
from PIL import Image
from io import BytesIO

def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
    if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA':
        # Create a new RGBA image with white background
        background = Image.new('RGBA', image.size, (255, 255, 255, 255))
        background.paste(image, (0, 0), image)  # Use the alpha channel
        image = background.convert('RGB')  # Convert to RGB while maintaining colors
    elif image.mode != 'RGB':
        image = image.convert('RGB')

    if size:
        image = image.copy()
        image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)

    buf = BytesIO()
    image.save(buf, 'JPEG')
    return image, buf
```

By updating the function to correctly handle RGBA images during conversion to RGB mode by pasting on an RGBA background and then converting, the bug should be fixed, and the failing test should pass successfully.
