### Analysis:
1. The `convert_image` function is responsible for converting image formats and resizing them if specified. The function converts images to RGB mode and JPEG format before resizing.
   
2. The potential error locations could be in the image conversion logic, particularly around checking the format and mode of the image.

3. In the failing test, the issue arises when comparing the colors of the converted image. It fails to match the expected colors, indicating a problem with the conversion process. The error message highlights the mismatch between the expected and actual colors of the converted image.

4. To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the image conversion process is conducted correctly based on the image format and mode.

### Fix Strategy:
We will adjust the image conversion logic to handle RGBA images correctly by creating a white background and then converting it to RGB. Additionally, we will ensure that the image format is converted to RGB if it is not already in that format.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
    if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA':
        background = Image.new('RGBA', image.size, (255, 255, 255))
        background.paste(image, (0, 0), mask=image)
        image = background.convert('RGB')
    elif image.mode != 'RGB':
        image = image.convert('RGB')

    if size:
        image = image.copy()
        image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)

    buf = BytesIO()
    image.save(buf, 'JPEG')
    return image, buf
```

With the corrected version of the `convert_image` function, the bug should be fixed, and the failing test should pass successfully.
