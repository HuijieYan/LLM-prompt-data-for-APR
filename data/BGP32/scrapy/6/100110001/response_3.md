### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `convert_image` is supposed to handle image conversions including resizing and format changes.
2. The failing test `test_convert_image` checks multiple scenarios of image conversions and asserts the properties of the converted images.
3. The error occurs in the transparency case with RGBA and PNG images. The failing assertion is based on the getcolors() method.
4. The bug is likely related to the incorrect handling of transparency during image conversion.
   
### Bug Fix Strategy:
- We need to address the handling of transparency in RGBA images during the conversion process. Converting RGBA to RGB needs proper handling to preserve transparency information.
- The issue seems to be in the specific condition where the input image is PNG in RGBA mode with transparency. When converting to RGB, the transparency information should be taken into account to avoid color shifts.

### Corrected Function:
```python
def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
    if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA':
        background = Image.new('RGBA', image.size, (255, 255, 255, 255)) # Add alpha channel for background
        background.paste(image, (0, 0), image)
        image = background.convert('RGB')
    elif image.mode != 'RGB':
        image = image.convert('RGB')

    if size:
        image = image.copy()
        image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)

    buf = BytesIO()
    image.save(buf, 'JPEG')
    return image, buf
```

By pasting the RGBA image with transparency onto a white background and then converting to RGB, we ensure that the transparency information is preserved during the conversion. This corrected function should now pass the failing test successfully.
