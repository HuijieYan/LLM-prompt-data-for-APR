### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `convert_image` is supposed to handle image conversions, such as converting RGBA PNG images to RGB and resizing images if a size is specified.
2. The failing test `test_convert_image` checks various scenarios, including converting RGB JPEG images, resizing images, and converting RGBA PNG images. 
3. The failing test fails with an assertion error at the line: `self.assertEquals(converted.getcolors(), [(10000, (205, 230, 255))])`. The error message indicates that the actual converted image colors are different than expected in one of the test cases involving RGBA to RGB conversion.
4. The bug might be related to handling transparent images and incorrect conversion or handling of the image format.
5. To fix the bug, we need to ensure that transparent images are handled correctly during conversion, and the image format conversions are done accurately.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Check the logic for handling transparent images (RGBA) and ensure that it is properly converted to RGB.
2. Verify the conversion steps for different image formats (PNG, JPEG) to maintain image integrity.
3. Update the conversion logic to correctly handle various image modes and formats.
4. Ensure that the image resizing is done consistently and accurately.

### The corrected version of the function:

```python
def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
    if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA':
        background = Image.new('RGB', image.size, (255, 255, 255))
        background.paste(image, image)
        image = background
    elif image.mode != 'RGB':
        image = image.convert('RGB')

    if size:
        image = image.copy()
        image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)

    buf = BytesIO()
    image.save(buf, 'JPEG')
    return image, buf
```

By correcting the function as shown above, we ensure that the handling of RGBA PNG images is done correctly, and images are converted to RGB format without losing transparency information. Additionally, the image resizing and format conversion steps are adjusted to pass the failing test cases effectively.
