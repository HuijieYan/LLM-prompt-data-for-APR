### Analysis:
The buggy function `convert_image()` is encountering an issue when dealing with images with transparency. There are two main issues causing the failure:
1. When the input image is in PNG format with RGBA mode, the function does not correctly handle the transparency. It tries to convert the image to RGB by pasting it on a white background, but this results in the transparent parts becoming white.
2. The measurement of image similarity (`getcolors()`) is not appropriately handling images with transparency, leading to incorrect comparisons.

### Error:
The error occurs when attempting to compare the expected colors (with transparency) after the conversion of an RGBA image from PNG format to RGB. The function is not correctly maintaining the transparency of the original image, leading to incorrect pixel color comparison.

### Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, the function needs to handle transparent images correctly by preserving transparency information during the conversion. Additionally, the measurement of image similarity needs to be improved to consider images with transparency.

### Corrected Function:
```python
def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
    if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA':
        background = Image.new('RGBA', image.size, (255, 255, 255, 255))
        background.paste(image, image)
        image = background.convert('RGBA')
    elif image.mode != 'RGB':
        image = image.convert('RGB')

    if size:
        image = image.copy()
        image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)

    buf = BytesIO()
    image.save(buf, 'JPEG')
    return image, buf
```

In the corrected function:
1. For PNG images with RGBA mode, a transparent white background is created to preserve transparency during the conversion.
2. The conversion to RGB is adjusted to RGBA to maintain the transparency.
3. The getcolors() function does not need to be modified as behavior is adequate for checking similarity in RGB and RGBA modes. 

By updating the function as described above, the issue with transparency and the image color comparison should be resolved.
