### Analysis:
- The buggy function `convert_image` is responsible for converting an image to RGB format and generating a JPEG binary output.
- The failing test is `test_convert_image`, which checks the conversion process under various scenarios like RGB to JPEG, resizing, handling transparency, and image formats.
- The error message indicates that the test is failing due to a mismatch in the expected and actual colors of the converted image.

### Bug:
The bug occurs when handling transparency in the image. In the case where the input image is in RGBA format and PNG format, the function attempts to remove the transparency channel by pasting the image on a white background. However, due to a mistake in the `paste` method, the transparency is not properly handled, resulting in an incorrect converted image.

### Fix Strategy:
1. Ensure that transparency is correctly handled when converting RGBA PNG images to RGB format.
2. Make sure that the pasting operation is done correctly so that the transparency channel is preserved.

### Corrected Function:
```python
def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
    if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA':
        background = Image.new('RGB', image.size, (255, 255, 255))
        background.paste(image, (0, 0), image)
        image = background.convert('RGB')
    elif image.mode != 'RGB':
        image = image.convert('RGB')

    if size:
        image = image.copy()
        image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)

    buf = BytesIO()
    image.save(buf, 'JPEG')
    return image, buf
```

After applying the fix, the `convert_image` function should handle transparency in images correctly by properly pasting the RGBA image on a white background before converting it to RGB. This should address the failing test and ensure that the expected colors match the actual colors of the converted image.
