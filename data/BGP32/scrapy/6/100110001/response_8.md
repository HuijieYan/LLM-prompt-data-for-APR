### Analysis:
The buggy function `convert_image` is supposed to handle image conversions and resizing. The error message from the failing test indicates a mismatch in the converted colors for an image. The failing assertion is related to the `getcolors()` method on the image object.

### Bug Identification:
1. The bug might be related to the handling of transparency in images specified in the RGB and JPEG conversion condition.
2. There could be a potential issue with the conversion of images from RGBA to RGB.

### Bug Explanation:
The failing test is expecting the converted image colors to match certain values, but due to the bug in the conversion logic, the converted colors are different, leading to the assertion failure.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure proper handling of transparency in images when performing conversions. Additionally, we need to ensure that the conversion from RGBA to RGB preserves the color values correctly.

### Corrected Function:
Here is a corrected version of the `convert_image` function:

```python
def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
    if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA':
        background = Image.new('RGBA', image.size, (255, 255, 255, 255))
        background.paste(image, (0, 0), image)
        image = background.convert('RGB')
    elif image.mode != 'RGB':
        image = image.convert('RGB')

    if size:
        image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)

    buf = BytesIO()
    image.save(buf, 'JPEG')
    return image, buf
```

With the corrections applied to handle transparency and RGBA to RGB conversion properly, the function should now pass the failing test.
