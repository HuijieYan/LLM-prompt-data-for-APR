### Analysis:
1. The `convert_image` function is designed to convert images to a specified format and size. It handles different image modes and formats, ensuring that the output image always has the desired characteristics.
2. The function first checks if the input image is of format 'PNG' and mode 'RGBA'. If so, it creates a new background image of mode 'RGBA', pastes the original image onto it, and converts the result to mode 'RGB'.
3. The bug occurs when performing the conversion for transparency cases with RGBA format and PNG images. The failing test checks if the output image has specific color values, which are not correctly handled during the conversion process.
4. The issue seems to be related to the conversion process for PNG images with RGBA mode, leading to incorrect color values in the resulting image.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To address the bug and ensure that the function correctly converts PNG images with RGBA mode to RGB format, we need to adjust the conversion logic to handle transparency correctly and preserve the color values. Specifically, we should ensure that transparency is accounted for during the conversion process.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
    if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA':
        background = Image.new('RGBA', image.size, (255, 255, 255, 255))  # Include full alpha channel for transparency
        background.paste(image, (0, 0), image)
        image = background.convert('RGB')
    elif image.mode != 'RGB':
        image = image.convert('RGB')

    if size:
        image = image.copy()
        image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)

    buf = BytesIO()
    image.save(buf, 'JPEG')
    return image, buf
```

With this correction, the function now handles RGBA format PNG images correctly by ensuring that transparency is accounted for during the conversion process. This adjustment should resolve the bug and make the function compatible with the failing test.
