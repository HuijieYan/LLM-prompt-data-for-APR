### Explanation:
The buggy function `convert_image` has a bug in the condition where it checks if the input image format is PNG and mode is RGBA. It creates a new image with a white background and attempts to paste the input image onto it. However, the `paste` function doesn't work as intended here, resulting in an incorrect image being created.

In the failing test, particularly in Case 3, we see that when the input image is in PNG format and RGBA mode, the conversion leads to an unexpected outcome. The error message indicates that the colors of the images differ, causing the test to fail.

### Bug Cause:
When the input image is in PNG format and RGBA mode, creating a new image with a white background and pasting the input image over it does not maintain transparency correctly, leading to an incorrect result.

### Bug Fix:
To fix the bug, we should modify the code to properly handle images in PNG format with RGBA mode. One approach is to create a new image with an RGBA mode background, composite the input image over this background using `alpha_composite`, and then convert the result to RGB mode.

### Corrected Version:
```python
from PIL import Image
from io import BytesIO

class ImagesPipeline(FilesPipeline):
    def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
        if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA':
            background = Image.new('RGBA', image.size, (255, 255, 255, 255))
            background.alpha_composite(image)
            image = background.convert('RGB')
        elif image.mode != 'RGB':
            image = image.convert('RGB')
    
        if size:
            image = image.copy()
            image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)
    
        buf = BytesIO()
        image.save(buf, 'JPEG')
        return image, buf
```

By incorporating the correct handling of transparency with the above changes, the fixed `convert_image` function should now produce the expected results and pass the failing tests.
