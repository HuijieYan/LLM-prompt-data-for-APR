### Explanation:
The buggy function `convert_image` in the `ImagesPipeline` class has a bug that arises when the input image is in PNG format and RGBA mode. In this case, the function tries to create a new image with an RGB format to remove transparency. However, the bug occurs in the line:
```python
background.paste(image, image)
```
The correct paste command should be:
```python
background.paste(image, (0, 0), image)
```
By providing the correct position (0, 0) to paste the original image onto the new background image. This bug causes the resulting image to contain unexpected colors and patterns, leading to the failing tests.

### Strategy for fixing the bug:
To fix the bug in the `convert_image` function, the correct `paste` method should be used with the position argument specified. This will ensure that the image is correctly pasted onto the new background image without causing distortion or color issues.

### The corrected version of the function:
```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: scrapy/pipelines/images.py

from PIL import Image
from cStringIO import StringIO as BytesIO


class ImagesPipeline(FilesPipeline):
    """
    Abstract pipeline that implements the image thumbnail generation logic
    """

    def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
        if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA':
            background = Image.new('RGBA', image.size, (255, 255, 255))
            background.paste(image, (0, 0), image)
            image = background.convert('RGB')
        elif image.mode != 'RGB':
            image = image.convert('RGB')

        if size:
            image = image.copy()
            image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)

        buf = BytesIO()
        image.save(buf, 'JPEG')
        return image, buf
```

By applying this correction, the tests should now pass without any errors.
