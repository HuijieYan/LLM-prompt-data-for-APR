### Analysis:
1. The buggy function is `convert_image` inside the `ImagesPipeline` class. It is meant to convert images to a specified format and size, handling different cases such as transparency.
2. The bug is likely in the conditional logic determining whether the image's format is 'PNG' and the mode is 'RGBA'.
3. The failing test is checking the output image's color values after conversion. The error message indicates that the expected color values are not matching the actual values.
4. The bug seems to be in the conversion logic when handling RGBA images.
5. The bug is likely caused by incorrect handling of RGBA images by pasting the image onto a new background.
   
### Bug Fix:
To fix the bug, we need to correctly handle RGBA images when converting. Instead of creating a new background and pasting the image onto it, we should directly convert the image to RGB if its mode is not RGB.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
    if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA':
        image = image.convert('RGB')
    elif image.mode != 'RGB':
        image = image.convert('RGB')

    if size:
        image = image.copy()
        image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)

    buf = BytesIO()
    image.save(buf, 'JPEG')
    return image, buf
```
