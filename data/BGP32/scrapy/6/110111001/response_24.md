### Potential Error Locations:
1. In the conditional statement checking for image format and mode. It might not cover all scenarios leading to incorrect conversions.
2. In the handling of transparency cases (PNG and RGBA) where a new background image is created but not converted properly.
3. In the save method where 'JPEG' format is hardcoded, which might not be applicable for all cases.

### Bug Cause:
The bug arises due to a flawed conditional check for image format and mode in the `convert_image` function. It fails to properly handle transparency cases where the original image mode is 'RGBA' and format is 'PNG'. The background image created is not converted to 'RGB' format, leading to incorrect pixel color values, resulting in failing tests due to incorrect assertions of pixel colors.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
1. Update the conditional logic to handle transparency cases correctly when the image mode is 'RGBA' and format is 'PNG'.
2. Ensure that the background image, if created, is converted to 'RGB' format before further processing.
3. Make the output format of the image conversion dynamic based on the original image format.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
    if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA':
        background = Image.new('RGB', image.size, (255, 255, 255))
        background.paste(image, (0, 0), image)
        image = background
    elif image.mode != 'RGB':
        image = image.convert('RGB')

    if size:
        image = image.copy()
        image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)

    buf = BytesIO()
    image.save(buf, image.format)
    return image, buf
```

In the corrected version:
- Transparency cases (PNG and RGBA) are handled by properly converting the background image to 'RGB' format.
- The image format used in the `image.save` method is dynamic based on the original image format.
- This updated version should pass the failing tests by handling all scenarios correctly.
