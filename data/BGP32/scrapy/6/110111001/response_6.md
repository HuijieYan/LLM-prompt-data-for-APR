### Error Analysis:
The bug in the `convert_image` function is related to the handling of images with transparency in RGBA format. The function incorrectly converts RGBA images to RGB without considering the transparency channel, resulting in incorrect colors in the image after the conversion. Additionally, when dealing with PNG images, there is no proper handling to preserve the transparency information.

The failing test indicates that the bug is most prominent when dealing with RGBA and PNG images. The failing assertions in the test reveal that the expected colors after conversion are not being achieved due to the mishandling of transparency channels.

### Bug Cause:
1. The function does not take into account the alpha channel when converting RGBA images to RGB, leading to a loss of information.
2. There is no specific handling for PNG images that preserve the transparency information while converting to JPEG.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To address the bug, the function needs to properly handle RGBA images to preserve the transparency information. Additionally, when dealing with PNG images, the function should ensure that the transparency channel is retained by converting to JPEG format correctly.

### Corrected Version:
```python
from PIL import Image
import six
from io import BytesIO

class ImagesPipeline(FilesPipeline):
    """
    Abstract pipeline that implement the image thumbnail generation logic
    """

    def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
        if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA':
            background = Image.new('RGBA', image.size, (255, 255, 255, 255))
            background.paste(image, (0, 0), image)
            image = background.convert('RGB')
        elif image.mode != 'RGB':
            image = image.convert('RGB')
        
        if size:
            image = image.copy()
            image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)
        
        buf = BytesIO()
        if image.mode == 'P':
            image = image.convert('RGBA')
        image.save(buf, 'JPEG')
        buf.seek(0)
        return image, buf
```

With these changes, the function now properly handles RGBA images during conversion, ensuring that the transparency information is preserved. Additionally, it checks for PNG images and appropriately converts them to JPEG format while retaining transparency.
