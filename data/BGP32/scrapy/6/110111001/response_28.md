### Bug Explanation
The bug in the `convert_image` function lies in the conditional statement where it checks if the image format is PNG and mode is RGBA. When these conditions are met, the function tries to create a new image with a white background and then paste the original image on top of it, converting it to RGB mode. However, the `paste` method is not used correctly, leading to the failure when comparing the colors of the images.

In the failing test case, when converting an RGBA PNG image to RGB mode, the conversion is not done properly, leading to incorrect pixel color values and failing assertions in the test.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to correct the way we handle the conversion of RGBA PNG images to RGB mode. One possible solution is to use the `Image.alpha_composite` method instead of `paste` to properly handle transparency in the image. This will ensure that the conversion from RGBA to RGB mode is done correctly.

Another improvement could be to check if the image mode is either RGBA or P (palette mode) before conversion to ensure all cases are properly handled.

### Corrected Function
Here is the corrected version of the `convert_image` function:

```python
def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
    if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA':
        background = Image.new('RGBA', image.size, (255, 255, 255))
        image = Image.alpha_composite(background, image)
        image = image.convert('RGB')
    elif image.mode != 'RGB':
        image = image.convert('RGB')

    if size:
        image = image.copy()
        image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)

    buf = BytesIO()
    image.save(buf, 'JPEG')
    return image, buf
```

By using `alpha_composite` for handling transparency and ensuring correct mode checks, the function should now properly convert images, passing the failing test.
