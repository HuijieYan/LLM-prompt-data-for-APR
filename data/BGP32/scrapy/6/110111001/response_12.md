### Explanation:
The buggy function `convert_image` is intended to handle different image formats and convert them to RGB format and produce a JPEG image. However, there are some issues causing the test to fail:
1. In the first if statement, when the image format is `'PNG'` and the mode is `'RGBA'`, the background image is created correctly but when pasting the original image onto the background, there is a mistake in the argument passed to the `paste` method. It should be `background.paste(image, (0, 0, image.size[0], image.size[1]))` instead of `background.paste(image, image)`. This is causing the transparency issue with RGBA images.
2. In the second `elif` statement, when the image mode is not 'RGB', the image is converted to 'RGB' format. However, this conversion is not correctly handled for certain image types like 'RGBA'.
3. The final issue is that the image is always saved as JPEG format regardless of the input format, which can lead to format mismatch issues.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
1. Correct the arguments passed to the `paste` function to correctly overlay the original image onto the background.
2. Adjust the image conversion logic to handle 'RGBA' images properly.
3. Save the image in the appropriate format based on the input format.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
from PIL import Image
from cStringIO import StringIO as BytesIO

class ImagesPipeline(FilesPipeline):
    def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
        if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA':
            background = Image.new('RGBA', image.size, (255, 255, 255))
            background.paste(image, (0, 0, image.size[0], image.size[1]))
            image = background.convert('RGB')
        elif image.mode != 'RGB':
            if image.mode == 'P':
                image = image.convert('RGBA').convert('RGB')
            else:
                image = image.convert('RGB')

        if size:
            image = image.copy()
            image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)
    
        buf = BytesIO()
        image.save(buf, image.format)
        return image, buf
```

With these corrections, the function should now correctly handle different image formats and modes, and the failing test should pass.
