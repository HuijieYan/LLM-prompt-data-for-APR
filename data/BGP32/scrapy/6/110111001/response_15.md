### Identified issues in the buggy function:
1. The condition in the `if` statement checking for PNG format and RGBA mode is incorrect. It should compare the lowercase format and mode to avoid discrepancies due to casing.
2. In the same `if` statement, the `paste` function is used incorrectly, resulting in the background image not being placed properly.
3. The conversion to RGB is incorrect for images with transparency. It should account for transparency when converting to RGB.
4. The function saves the image as a JPEG regardless of its original format, leading to incorrect output.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Correct the condition by comparing lowercase format and mode.
2. Fix the `paste` function to correctly overlay the image on the background.
3. Adjust the conversion for PNG format and RGBA mode images to maintain transparency.
4. Save the image based on its original format to preserve image properties.

### Corrected version of the function:
```python
def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
    if image.format.lower() == 'png' and image.mode == 'RGBA':
        background = Image.new('RGBA', image.size, (255, 255, 255, 255))
        background.paste(image, (0, 0), image)
        image = background.convert('RGBA')
    elif image.mode != 'RGB':
        image = image.convert('RGB')

    if size:
        image = image.copy()
        image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)

    buf = BytesIO()
    image.save(buf, image.format)
    return image, buf
```

By making these changes, the corrected function should now pass the failing test cases provided.
