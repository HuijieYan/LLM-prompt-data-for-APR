### Explanation:
The buggy function `convert_image()` has an issue with how it handles images when the format is PNG and mode is RGBA. The function incorrectly converts the RGBA image to RGB without considering the transparency, leading to an incorrect output. This is evident from the failing test where the converted image colors do not match the expected values.

In Case 3, the function is failing to handle PNG RGBA images properly, resulting in a loss of transparency information during the conversion process.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to modify the function to handle PNG RGBA images correctly. We should create a new image with a white background, paste the original RGBA image onto it, and then convert the combined image to RGB. This approach will preserve the transparency during the conversion process.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
    if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA':
        background = Image.new('RGBA', image.size, (255, 255, 255, 255))
        background.paste(image, (0, 0), image)
        image = background.convert('RGB')
    elif image.mode != 'RGB':
        image = image.convert('RGB')

    if size:
        image = image.copy()
        image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)

    buf = BytesIO()
    image.save(buf, 'JPEG')
    return image, buf
``` 

By properly handling PNG RGBA images in the corrected version, the function should now pass the failing tests and provide the expected output.
