### Analysis
1. The `convert_image` function is intended to convert images to RGB mode and adjust their size if required. However, there are issues with the conversions, especially when dealing with RGBA format images.
2. The buggy function encounters problems when converting images in RGBA format to RGB mode.
3. In Case 3, when input image is in PNG format with RGBA mode, the function creates a new background image in RGBA format and tries to paste the original image onto it. This operation fails because the original image mode is RGBA, causing the background to be filled with transparency. Subsequently, the function converts this new background image to RGB, resulting in the loss of the alpha channel and affecting the output values.
4. To fix the bug, we need to handle RGBA format images differently to retain the alpha channel during the conversion process.
5. Here is the corrected version of the `convert_image` function:

```python
def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
    if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA':
        # Create a new RGBA image with white background
        background = Image.new('RGBA', image.size, (255, 255, 255))

        # Composite the original image onto the white background
        background.paste(image, (0, 0), image)

        # Convert the composited image to RGB
        image = background.convert('RGB')
    
    elif image.mode != 'RGB':
        image = image.convert('RGB')

    if size:
        image = image.copy()
        image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)

    buf = BytesIO()
    image.save(buf, 'JPEG')
    
    return image, buf
```

By correctly handling RGBA format images by compositing them on a white background before conversion, the corrected function should now pass the failing tests.
