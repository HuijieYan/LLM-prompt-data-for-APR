### Bug Explanation:
The bug in the `convert_image` function arises from the incorrect handling of images with format 'PNG' and mode 'RGBA'. When the input image has these characteristics, the function tries to convert it to RGB by creating a new background image filled with white color and pasting the original image over it. However, the problem lies in the line `background.paste(image, image)` where the second `image` parameter should be the image itself, but it is passed as an argument, resulting in an incorrect paste operation.

### Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to update the code responsible for pasting the original image onto the white background correctly. By replacing `background.paste(image, image)` with `background.paste(image, (0, 0), image)`, we ensure that the original image is pasted onto the background image at the correct position.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
    if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA':
        background = Image.new('RGBA', image.size, (255, 255, 255))
        background.paste(image, (0, 0), image)
        image = background.convert('RGB')
    elif image.mode != 'RGB':
        image = image.convert('RGB')

    if size:
        image = image.copy()
        image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)

    buf = BytesIO()
    image.save(buf, 'JPEG')
    return image, buf
``` 

This corrected version of the `convert_image` function should now correctly handle PNG images with RGBA mode and convert them to RGB format without the paste operation error, addressing the failing test cases.
