### Analysis
The buggy function is intended to convert images to RGB mode if necessary and generate image thumbnails if a size is provided. The bug seems to be related to the conversion of the image format and mode. Specifically, when an image has a format of 'PNG' and a mode of 'RGBA', the function attempts to convert it to an RGB image, but it does not handle transparency correctly, resulting in incorrect pixel color values.

The failing test cases provide examples of images with different formats and modes that trigger the bug. 

1. In Case 1, an image with format 'JPEG' and mode 'RGB' is provided, requesting no thumbnail generation. The test checks if the mode remains 'RGB' and the color values are maintained.
2. In Case 2, a thumbnail is requested, and the function should return an RGB image with a size of 10x10. The test checks the mode and size of the resulting thumbnail.
3. In Case 3, an image with format 'PNG' and mode 'RGBA' is provided. The test expects the function to convert it to an RGB image correctly, handling transparency.
4. Case 4 highlights a scenario where an image starts in 'P' mode (palette), which should be converted to RGB mode appropriately.

The error occurs when the function fails to handle transparency correctly during the conversion. It leads to incorrect color values in the converted images, causing the tests to fail.

### Bug Cause
The bug is caused by the incorrect handling of transparency when converting images with the format 'PNG' and mode 'RGBA' to RGB. The function does not account for the alpha channel (transparency) properly, resulting in wrong color values.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to modify the code to handle transparency correctly when converting images from 'PNG' and 'RGBA' to 'RGB'. This involves creating a new background image with a white background to paste the original image onto, effectively removing transparency. Then converting the image to RGB mode will yield correct color values.

### Corrected Version of the Function
Here is the corrected version of the `convert_image` function:

```python
def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
    if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA':
        background = Image.new('RGB', image.size, (255, 255, 255))  # Create RGB background
        background.paste(image, mask=image.split()[3])  # Paste the RGBA image, considering the alpha channel
        image = background
    elif image.mode != 'RGB':
        image = image.convert('RGB')

    if size:
        image = image.copy()
        image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)

    buf = BytesIO()
    image.save(buf, 'JPEG')
    return image, buf
```

In the corrected version, we create an RGB background image filled with white color to remove transparency. Then, we paste the original RGBA image onto this background, considering the alpha channel as the mask. This ensures correct color values are preserved during the conversion.
