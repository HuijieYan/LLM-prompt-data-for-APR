### Identified issues:
1. The buggy function incorrectly handles images with format `'PNG'` and mode `'RGBA'`. It tries to convert them to RGB format without preserving the transparency, resulting in a loss of information.
2. When the image mode is not `'RGB'`, the function does not handle it properly.
3. The function attempts to save the image in the JPEG format regardless of its original format.

### Suggestions for fixing the bug:
1. Modify the function to handle images with format `'PNG'` and mode `'RGBA'` by properly converting them to RGB format while preserving transparency.
2. Handle cases where the image mode is not `'RGB'` to convert the image appropriately.
3. Update the function to save the image based on its original format, ensuring it retains the correct format.

### Corrected version of the function:
```python
def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
    if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA':
        new_image = Image.new('RGBA', image.size, (255, 255, 255, 255))
        new_image.paste(image, (0, 0), image)
        image = new_image.convert('RGB')
    elif image.mode != 'RGB':
        image = image.convert('RGB')

    if size:
        image = image.resize(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)

    buf = BytesIO()
    image.save(buf, image.format)
    return image, buf
```

By using this corrected version of the function, the issues related to handling PNG images with RGBA mode and saving images in the correct format should be resolved. Please test the function with the provided failing test to ensure it passes successfully.
