### Analysis
- The buggy function `convert_image` is supposed to handle image conversion and resizing.
- The bug occurs when the input image is in PNG format and RGBA mode. It attempts to convert this image correctly, but makes a mistake in the process.
- In the failing test, the failed assertion is due to incorrect color values after the conversion of the PNG image from RGBA to RGB.
- The cause of the bug is the incorrect handling of transparency in the PNG image during conversion.
- The `getcolors()` method retrieves the colors used in the image based on a palette or actual values. If these values are incorrect after conversion, the assertion fails.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to revise the conversion logic for PNG images with RGBA mode. Transparency information should be properly handled during the conversion to RGB to ensure correct color values.

### Corrected Function
```python
def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
    if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA':
        background = Image.new('RGB', image.size, (255, 255, 255))
        image = Image.alpha_composite(background, image).convert('RGB')
    elif image.mode != 'RGB':
        image = image.convert('RGB')

    if size:
        image = image.copy()
        image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)

    buf = BytesIO()
    image.save(buf, 'JPEG')
    return image, buf
```

By using `Image.alpha_composite`, we correctly handle the transparent regions of the image during conversion and ensure the color values are maintained accurately. This corrected version should now pass the failing test cases.
