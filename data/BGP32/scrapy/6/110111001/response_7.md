### Analysis
1. The `convert_image` function in the `ImagesPipeline` class has a bug related to image conversion. The bug occurs when the input image is in PNG format and has RGBA mode. In this case, the function incorrectly converts the image to RGB format without handling the alpha channel properly. This causes the resulting image color to be incorrect.
2. The bug can be identified in the conditional check where the image format is PNG and the mode is RGBA. The conversion logic inside this condition is incorrect.
3. The failing test cases involve testing image conversions with different formats and modes. The error message indicates a mismatch in the colors of the converted images, which points to a problem in handling transparency.
4. To fix the bug, we need to modify the conversion logic specifically for images with PNG format and RGBA mode to ensure proper handling of transparency.
5. Here is the corrected version of the `convert_image` function:

```python
def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
    if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA':
        background = Image.new('RGBA', image.size, (255, 255, 255, 255))
        background.paste(image, image)
        image = background.convert('RGB')
    elif image.mode != 'RGB':
        image = image.convert('RGB')

    if size:
        image = image.copy()
        image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)

    buf = BytesIO()
    image.save(buf, 'JPEG')
    return image, buf
```

By adding an alpha channel with full opacity (255) in the RGBA background image creation for PNG with RGBA mode images, this corrected function should handle transparency correctly.
