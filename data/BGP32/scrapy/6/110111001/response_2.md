### Bug Analysis:
1. The bug occurs when the input image format is 'PNG' and the mode is 'RGBA'. The buggy function tries to convert the image to RGB format by creating a new RGBA background image and pasting the original image onto it. However, the paste operation is incorrect, leading to the incorrect conversion.
2. In the second case, where a thumbnail is created with a specified size, the new image's size is not correctly adjusted, causing a mismatch with the expected output.
3. The logic to handle different image formats and modes is flawed, leading to incorrect image manipulation and conversion.
4. The bug causes the failing tests to produce an error due to the incorrect conversion of the RGBA image to RGB format.

### Fix Strategy:
1. Correct the logic for converting RGBA images to RGB format by using the `convert` method instead of pasting the image onto a new background.
2. Ensure that the thumbnail image is resized correctly to match the specified size keeping the aspect ratio intact.
3. Update the conversion process based on the image format and mode to handle various scenarios correctly.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
    if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA':
        image = image.convert('RGB')
    elif image.mode != 'RGB':
        image = image.convert('RGB')

    if size:
        image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)

    buf = BytesIO()
    image.save(buf, 'JPEG')
    return image, buf
``` 

By making these corrections, the function should now handle image conversions and thumbnail creation accurately, passing the failing tests successfully.
