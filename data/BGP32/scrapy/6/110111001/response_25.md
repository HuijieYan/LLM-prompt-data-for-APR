### Explanation
The buggy function `convert_image` is intended to handle image conversions and thumbnail generation. The bug occurs when the input image is in PNG format and RGBA mode. In this case, the function attempts to create a new background image in RGBA mode and paste the original image onto it. However, when pasting the image, it uses the original image itself as the second argument instead of pasting the image data. This leads to an incorrect conversion and causes the test to fail when checking the colors of the converted image.

### Bug
The bug arises from the incorrect usage of the `paste` method where the original image itself is passed as the second argument instead of its data. This results in an incorrect conversion of the image and hence the failing test case.

### Fix
To fix the bug, we need to correct the `paste` method usage by passing the image data instead of the image itself. Additionally, we need to update the check for PNG and RGBA images to ensure correct conversion. Here's the corrected version of the `convert_image` function:

```python
def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
    if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA':
        background = Image.new('RGB', image.size, (255, 255, 255))
        background.paste(image, (0, 0), image)
        image = background
    elif image.mode != 'RGB':
        image = image.convert('RGB')

    if size:
        image = image.copy()
        image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)

    buf = BytesIO()
    image.save(buf, 'JPEG')
    return image, buf
```

This corrected version properly pastes the image data onto the background, and ensures the correct conversion of PNG images with RGBA mode.
