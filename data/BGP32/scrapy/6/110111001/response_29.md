### Potential Error Location
The potential error in the buggy function lies in the image conversion logic for PNG images with RGBA mode. It incorrectly converts the RGBA image to an RGB image without considering the transparency information.

### Cause of the Bug
The bug occurs because when dealing with PNG images in RGBA mode, the code converts the image to RGB without taking into account the alpha channel for transparency. This results in the loss of transparency information and incorrect conversion to RGB values, leading to failing test cases.

### Strategy to Fix the Bug
To fix the bug, the code needs to handle PNG images with RGBA mode correctly by preserving the transparency information during conversion to RGB. This involves creating a new RGBA image with a white background and pasting the original RGBA image onto it before converting to RGB.

### Corrected Version of the Function
Here is the corrected version of the `convert_image` function:

```python
def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
    if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA':
        background = Image.new('RGBA', image.size, (255, 255, 255, 255))
        background.paste(image, (0, 0), image)
        image = background.convert('RGB')
    elif image.mode != 'RGB':
        image = image.convert('RGB')

    if size:
        image = image.copy()
        image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)

    buf = BytesIO()
    image.save(buf, 'JPEG')
    return image, buf
```

This corrected version correctly handles the transparency information for PNG images with RGBA mode, preventing the loss of transparency during conversion to RGB.
