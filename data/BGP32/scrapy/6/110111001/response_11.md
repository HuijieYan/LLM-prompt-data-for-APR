### Bug Analysis:
The buggy function `convert_image` fails to handle transparent images properly. It only converts transparent images if they are in the RGBA format and are PNG images. If the input image is already in RGB format or in a different format than PNG, the function does not handle the transparency correctly.

### Bug Explanation:
1. In Case 1, the input image is in RGB format, and the function does not include a condition to handle transparency in this case.
2. In Case 2, the function resizes the image without considering its transparency, resulting in the thumbnail losing the alpha channel.
3. In Case 3, the function incorrectly creates a white background for the RGBA PNG image, which may interfere with the transparency settings.
4. In Case 4, the function fails to properly handle transparency in the palette format.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to enhance the function to properly handle transparency in all cases. Specifically, we need to check for transparency in images of any format and handle them accordingly, converting them to RGB format while preserving the transparency.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
    if image.mode in ['RGBA', 'LA'] or (image.mode == 'P' and 'transparency' in image.info):
        image = image.convert('RGBA') if image.mode != 'RGBA' else image
        background = Image.new('RGBA', image.size, (255, 255, 255, 255))
        background.paste(image, image)
        image = background.convert('RGB')
    else:
        image = image.convert('RGB')
    
    if size:
        image = image.copy()
        image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)

    buf = BytesIO()
    image.save(buf, 'JPEG')
    return image, buf
```

By updating the function as shown above, we handle transparency in all types of images correctly, converting them to RGB format while preserving transparency. This corrected version should pass the failing tests.
