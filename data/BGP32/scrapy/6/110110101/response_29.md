### Analysis
1. The `convert_image` function takes an image and an optional size parameter and performs some operations like converting the image to RGB mode and resizing if a size is provided.
2. The bug seems to be in the condition to handle PNG format images with RGBA mode. The image is converted to RGB mode without considering the alpha channel.
3. The failing test is trying to ensure that the colors are correctly converted and maintained after the image manipulation. The bug causes wrong color conversion in RGBA mode PNG images.
4. To fix the bug, we need to handle the alpha channel properly when converting RGBA mode images to RGB.
5. We need to modify the part of the code that deals with PNG format images with RGBA mode.

### Bug Fix
Here is the corrected version of the `convert_image` function:

```python
def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
    if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA':
        background = Image.new('RGB', image.size, (255, 255, 255))
        background.paste(image, (0, 0), image)
        image = background
    elif image.mode != 'RGB':
        image = image.convert('RGB')

    if size:
        image = image.copy()
        image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)

    buf = BytesIO()
    image.save(buf, 'JPEG')
    return image, buf
```

With this fix, the function should now correctly handle PNG format images with RGBA mode, ensuring that the alpha channel is taken into account during the conversion process.
