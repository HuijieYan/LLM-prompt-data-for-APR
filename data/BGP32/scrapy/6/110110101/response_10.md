### Analysis
1. The buggy function `convert_image` is meant to handle different types and formats of images, converting them to a standardized format and resizing them if needed. It currently has issues with handling PNG images with alpha channel and also fails to keep the image ratio when resizing.
2. The bug is primarily in the conditional block that handles PNG images with RGBA mode. It creates a new RGBA image for the background and pastes the original image onto it incorrectly. This causes the alpha channel to be lost and the colors to be inaccurate.
3. The failing test specifically checks for the colors of the converted images and fails when the expected colors don't match the actual colors. This highlights the issue with handling PNG images with transparency.
4. To fix the bug, we need to correctly handle PNG images with an alpha channel by properly pasting them on a new RGBA background. Additionally, the thumbnail resizing logic needs to be updated to maintain the image ratio.
   
### Bug Fix Strategy
1. Check the image format and mode to correctly handle PNG images with an alpha channel.
2. Create a new RGBA image background for PNG images with correct pasting to preserve transparency.
3. Update the thumbnail resizing logic to maintain the image ratio.
4. Save the image in the correct format (JPEG) after processing.

### Corrected Version of the Function
```python
# Corrected version of the buggy function
def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
    if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA':
        background = Image.new('RGBA', image.size, (255, 255, 255, 255))  # Create proper RGBA background
        background.paste(image, (0, 0), image)  # Paste the original image onto the background
        image = background.convert('RGB')  # Convert the image to RGB mode
    elif image.mode != 'RGB':
        image = image.convert('RGB')
    
    if size:
        image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)
    
    buf = BytesIO()
    image.save(buf, format='JPEG')  # Save the processed image in JPEG format
    return image, buf
```

By correcting the handling of PNG images with an alpha channel, correctly pasting the images onto the background, and updating the thumbnail resizing logic, the corrected function should now pass all the test cases provided.
