### Analysis
- The buggy function `convert_image` is intended to convert an image to RGB mode and then create a thumbnail of it. 
- The function has a bug in the condition where it checks image format and mode to handle PNG images with RGBA mode. 
- The bug is causing incorrect color values in the converted images, leading the test case to fail.

### Bug Explanation
- The bug occurs in the if condition where it checks for PNG format and RGBA mode. If the condition is true, it creates a new RGBA background image and pastes the original image on it. However, the `paste` function is used incorrectly, resulting in incorrect colors.
- The incorrect usage of `paste` leads to the background image overwriting the original image, causing distorted colors in the output.

### Fix Strategy
- To fix the bug, we need to correct the way the original image is pasted on the background image. 
- We should use the `paste` function correctly to blend the original RGBA image with a white background image before converting it to RGB mode.
- By fixing the paste operation, we can ensure that the colors are maintained correctly during the conversion process.

### Corrected Version
```python
def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
    if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA':
        background = Image.new('RGBA', image.size, (255, 255, 255))
        background.paste(image, (0, 0), image)
        image = background.convert('RGB')
    elif image.mode != 'RGB':
        image = image.convert('RGB')

    if size:
        image = image.copy()
        image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)

    buf = BytesIO()
    image.save(buf, 'JPEG')
    return image, buf
``` 

### Conclusion
The bug was in the incorrect usage of the `paste` function, which caused distorted colors in the converted images. By fixing the paste operation, we can ensure that PNG images with RGBA mode are correctly converted to RGB without losing color information.
