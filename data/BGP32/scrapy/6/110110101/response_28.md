### Analysis
1. **Buggy Function**: The `convert_image` function is designed to convert images to the desired format and size for image thumbnail generation. It checks the image format and mode to perform the appropriate conversion operations.
   
2. **Error Location**: The error occurs in the section where the function handles images with PNG format and RGBA mode. It attempts to create a new image with a white background and paste the original image on it but has a mistake in the `paste` function call. Additionally, there might be an issue with the handling of RGBA images in general.

3. **Cause of the Bug**:
   - In the failing test, when an image with PNG format and RGBA mode is passed, the color values are incorrect after the conversion, resulting in the test failure.
   - The mistake in calling `background.paste(image, image)` leads to incorrect pasting of the original image onto the background.
   - The incorrect alpha channel handling for RGBA images could also be contributing to the issue.
   
4. **Strategy for Fixing the Bug**:
   - Correct the `paste` function call by providing the correct parameters to ensure the image is pasted correctly on the background.
   - Improve the handling of RGBA images to properly convert them to RGB format.
   - Ensure that transparency and alpha channel information is correctly maintained during the conversion process.

### Correction of the Buggy Function
```python
class ImagesPipeline(FilesPipeline):
    def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
        if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA':
            background = Image.new('RGBA', image.size, (255, 255, 255, 255))
            background.paste(image, (0, 0), image)
            image = background.convert('RGB')
        elif image.mode != 'RGB':
            image = image.convert('RGB')
    
        if size:
            image = image.copy()
            image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)
    
        buf = BytesIO()
        image.save(buf, 'JPEG')
        return image, buf
```

By correcting the `paste` function call to `background.paste(image, (0, 0), image)`, we ensure that the original image is properly pasted onto the white background. Additionally, handling the alpha channel more effectively should lead to the correct conversion of RGBA images to RGB format. This corrected version should pass all the test cases provided.
