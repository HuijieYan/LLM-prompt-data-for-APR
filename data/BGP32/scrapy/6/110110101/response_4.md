### Analysis
1. The buggy function `convert_image` within the `ImagesPipeline` class is responsible for converting images, handling transparency, and creating thumbnails.
2. The buggy function has issues with converting an RGBA image format to RGB format and creating thumbnails of incorrect sizes.
3. The failing test is trying to convert images with specific formats and sizes, but the function fails to return the expected results.
4. The bug arises due to incorrect handling of image formats and sizes within the function.
   
### Bug Explanation
The bug occurs when trying to convert an RGBA image to RGB format. The function should handle RGBA images properly by creating a white background to blend the transparency, then converting the image to RGB format. However, the bug causes the function to ignore the transparency and convert the image directly to RGB, resulting in incorrect colors. Additionally, when creating thumbnails, the function fails to maintain the correct aspect ratio, leading to incorrect thumbnail sizes.

### Bug Fix Strategy
1. Check the image format and mode to handle RGBA images correctly.
2. Create a white background for RGBA images before converting them to RGB.
3. Ensure that thumbnails maintain the correct aspect ratio during generation.

### Updated Corrected Function
```python
class ImagesPipeline(FilesPipeline):
    def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
        if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA':
            background = Image.new('RGB', image.size, (255, 255, 255))
            background.paste(image, (0, 0, image.size[0], image.size[1]))
            image = background.convert('RGB')
        elif image.mode != 'RGB':
            image = image.convert('RGB')
        
        if size:
            image = image.copy()
            image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)
        
        buf = BytesIO()
        image.save(buf, 'JPEG')
        return image, buf
```

After fixing the bug in the `convert_image` function, it should now handle RGBA images correctly by creating a white background and maintaining correct aspect ratios when creating thumbnails.
