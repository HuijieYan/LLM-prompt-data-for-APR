### Analysis
1. The buggy function `convert_image` is intended to handle image conversions and thumbnail generation.
2. The function has conditional statements to check the image format and mode for conversions.
3. The bug seems to be related to incorrect background handling when dealing with PNG images in RGBA mode.
4. The failing test is due to incorrect color values after conversion, causing a mismatch in expected and actual values.

### Bug Explanation
The buggy function has a conditional block to handle PNG images in RGBA mode by creating a new RGBA background, pasting the image on it, and then converting it to RGB mode. However, there is a mistake in the background paste line: `background.paste(image, image)`. The correct line should be `background.paste(image, (0, 0, *image.size))`, which specifies the position to paste the image on the background. This mistake leads to the incorrect conversion of the image, causing the failing test.

### Bug Fix
We need to correct the image pasting operation on the background by providing the correct position. This will ensure that the conversion logic for PNG images in RGBA mode works as intended.

### The corrected version of the function
```python
def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
    if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA':
        background = Image.new('RGBA', image.size, (255, 255, 255))
        background.paste(image, (0, 0, *image.size))
        image = background.convert('RGB')
    elif image.mode != 'RGB':
        image = image.convert('RGB')

    if size:
        image = image.copy()
        image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)

    buf = BytesIO()
    image.save(buf, 'JPEG')
    return image, buf
``` 

By fixing the way the image is pasted onto the background, we ensure that the thumbnail generation logic for RGBA PNG images is correct, thus satisfying the failing test.
