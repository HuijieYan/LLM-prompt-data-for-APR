### Analysis
The buggy function `convert_image` is designed to handle different image formats and modes and convert them to a unified format. The bug in this function is related to the conversion of images with a format of 'PNG' and a mode of 'RGBA'. The function incorrectly attempts to convert such images to 'RGB' without properly handling the transparency channel.

The failing test `test_convert_image` includes multiple cases to test the function with different image formats and modes. The error message indicates that in one of the cases, the converted image's colors do not match the expected values, leading to test failure.

### Bug Explanation
In the failing case with a PNG image in RGBA mode, the buggy function improperly converts the transparency channel to RGB by simply changing the format to 'RGB'. This leads to a loss of information from the alpha channel, resulting in incorrect color values. The test expects the colors to match the original image with transparency considered.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to properly handle images in 'PNG' format and 'RGBA' mode. We should preserve the transparency channel while converting to RGB. One common approach is to create a white background with the same size as the image, paste the original image onto the background, and then convert the resulting image to 'RGB'. This approach preserves the transparency information.

### Corrected Version of the Function
```python
def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
    if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA':
        background = Image.new('RGBA', image.size, (255, 255, 255, 255))
        background.paste(image, (0, 0), image)
        image = background.convert('RGB')
    elif image.mode != 'RGB':
        image = image.convert('RGB')
    
    if size:
        image = image.copy()
        image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)
    
    buf = BytesIO()
    image.save(buf, 'JPEG')
    return image, buf
```

By incorporating the suggested fix in the corrected version of the function above, the function should now handle images in 'PNG' format and 'RGBA' mode correctly, preserving transparency information while converting to RGB. This corrected version should pass all the test cases and satisfy the expected input/output variable values.
