### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `convert_image` is within the `ImagesPipeline` class and is designed to handle image conversion tasks. It checks the format and mode of the input image and performs conversions accordingly.
   
2. The bugs are likely to be in the conditional statements handling RGBA and PNG formats. The bug seems to be related to the conversion of images with transparency (RGBA format) to RGB format.
   
3. Based on the failing test, the error occurs during the comparison of colors after conversion. The expected colors are not being achieved after conversion from RGBA to RGB.
   
4. To fix the bug, we need to handle the transparency conversion correctly for RGBA images.
   
### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Check for images with RGBA format and transparency.
2. For RGBA images, create a new white background and paste the RGBA image onto it before converting it to RGB.
3. Ensure that the function correctly handles images with transparency to maintain the desired output.

### Corrected Function:
```python
class ImagesPipeline(FilesPipeline):
    # Corrected the buggy function
    def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
        if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA':
            background = Image.new('RGBA', image.size, (255, 255, 255, 255))
            background.paste(image, (0, 0), image)
            image = background.convert('RGB')
        elif image.mode != 'RGB':
            image = image.convert('RGB')
        
        if size:
            image = image.resize(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)
        
        buf = BytesIO()
        image.save(buf, 'JPEG')
        return image, buf
```

By updating the `convert_image` function in this way, we ensure that transparency in RGBA images is handled correctly by pasting the image onto a white background before converting to RGB. The corrected function should now pass the failing test and generate the expected output.
