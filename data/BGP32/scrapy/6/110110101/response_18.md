### Analysis
- The buggy function `convert_image` is part of the `ImagesPipeline` class.
- The function is responsible for converting images to the desired format and resizing them if needed.
- The bug seems to occur when dealing with PNG images with RGBA mode.
- The function is converting RGBA PNG images incorrectly, leading to a discrepancy in the test results.

### Bug Explanation
- The bug occurs when the input image is in PNG format and has RGBA mode. In this case, the function attempts to convert the image to RGB format, but it does not handle the transparency channel properly.
- The issue arises because when creating the new background image in RGBA mode, the code mistakenly pastes the original image onto the background image.
- This creates a situation where the alpha channel is not handled correctly, leading to unexpected color values.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug:
1. Create a new background image in RGBA mode.
2. Paste the original image *without* using the alpha channel.
3. Convert the image to RGB mode after pasting it onto the background.
4. Ensure that transparency is handled correctly during the conversion.

### Corrected Code
```python
class ImagesPipeline(FilesPipeline):
    """
    Abstract pipeline that implement the image thumbnail generation logic
    """

    def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
        if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA':
            background = Image.new('RGBA', image.size, (255, 255, 255, 255))  # Updated to include alpha channel in background
            background.paste(image, (0, 0), image)  # Paste the image without the alpha channel
            image = background.convert('RGB')
        elif image.mode != 'RGB':
            image = image.convert('RGB')

        if size:
            image = image.copy()
            image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)

        buf = BytesIO()
        image.save(buf, 'JPEG')

        return image, buf
```

After applying this fix, the `convert_image` function should handle RGBA PNG images correctly and pass the failing test cases.
