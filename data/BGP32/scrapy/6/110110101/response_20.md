### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `convert_image` is part of the `ImagesPipeline` class, which implements image processing functionalities.
2. The function is responsible for converting images to RGB mode and resizing them if needed.
3. The bug occurs when handling PNG images in RGBA mode. The function incorrectly converts them to RGB without preserving transparency.
4. The failing test `test_convert_image` checks various scenarios for image conversion and resizing, revealing the bug when dealing with RGBA PNG images.

### Bug:
The bug in the `convert_image` function occurs when processing PNG images in RGBA mode. Instead of preserving transparency, the function converts the image to RGB, resulting in the loss of transparency. This leads to failing test cases where the expected output includes transparency information.

### Fix:
To fix the bug, we need to modify the logic for handling PNG images with RGBA mode to preserve transparency. It involves creating a new RGBA image with a white background and then pasting the original image with transparency onto it. This way, we can ensure that transparency is maintained during the conversion process.

### Corrected Version:
```python
from scrapy.pipelines.files import FilesPipeline
from PIL import Image
from cStringIO import StringIO as BytesIO

class ImagesPipeline(FilesPipeline):
    def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
        if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA':
            background = Image.new('RGBA', image.size, (255, 255, 255, 255))  # Create RGBA background
            background.paste(image, (0, 0), image)  # Paste original image with transparency
            image = background.convert('RGB')  # Convert to RGB
        elif image.mode != 'RGB':
            image = image.convert('RGB')
        
        if size:
            image = image.copy()
            image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)
        
        buf = BytesIO()
        image.save(buf, 'JPEG')
        return image, buf
```

After replacing the buggy function with the corrected version, the function should now properly preserve transparency for PNG images in RGBA mode, satisfying the expected input/output values for all test cases.
