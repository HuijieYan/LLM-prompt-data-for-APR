### Analysis
1. The `convert_image` function receives an image and an optional `size` parameter to resize the image. It checks if the image format is PNG and the mode is RGBA. If so, it creates a new image with a white background, pastes the original image on it, converts it to RGB, and then applies the thumbnail transformation.
2. The bug seems to be related to the way the white background image is being pasted. The incorrect usage of `background.paste(image, image)` might be causing the issue.
3. The failing test specifically tests the case where an RGBA image with PNG format is converted, and the failing assertion is related to the color values not being as expected.
4. To fix the bug, we need to ensure that pasting the RGBA image onto a white background works correctly.
5. We should create a new white background image and paste the original image onto this new background, then convert it to RGB and continue with the thumbnail transformation. 

### Correction
```python
from scrapy.pipelines.images import ImagesPipeline
from PIL import Image
from cStringIO import StringIO as BytesIO

class CorrectedImagesPipeline(ImagesPipeline):
    
    def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
        if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA':
            background = Image.new('RGBA', image.size, (255, 255, 255, 255))  # Include alpha channel in background color
            background.paste(image, (0, 0), image)  # Paste the image onto the background at location (0,0)
            image = background.convert('RGB')
        elif image.mode != 'RGB':
            image = image.convert('RGB')
    
        if size:
            image = image.copy()
            image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)
    
        buf = BytesIO()
        image.save(buf, 'JPEG')
        return image, buf
```

By correcting the `paste` method in the buggy function to paste the image with its alpha channel correctly onto the white background, the corrected function should now pass all the test cases provided.
