### Analysis
1. The `convert_image` function in the `ImagesPipeline` class is responsible for handling different cases of image conversion and resizing.
2. The function seems to have a bug in the condition where it checks if the image format is PNG and the mode is RGBA. There is an incorrect usage of `paste` method which leads to the loss of transparency in the image.
3. The failing test specifically tests the transparency case where an RGBA PNG image is converted. The failing assertion is checking the colors after conversion, which indicates that transparency might not be preserved correctly.
4. To fix the bug, we need to correctly handle the transparency when converting PNG images with RGBA mode.
5. We will update the code to handle transparency correctly while converting the image by keeping the alpha channel intact.

### Bug Fix
```python
from PIL import Image
from cStringIO import StringIO as BytesIO

class ImagesPipeline(FilesPipeline):
    """
    Abstract pipeline that implement the image thumbnail generation logic
    """
    
    def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
        if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA':
            background = Image.new('RGBA', image.size, (255, 255, 255, 255))
            background.paste(image, (0,0), image)
            image = background.convert('RGB')
        elif image.mode != 'RGB':
            image = image.convert('RGB')
        
        if size:
            image = image.copy()
            image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)
        
        buf = BytesIO()
        image.save(buf, 'JPEG')
        return image, buf
```

By updating the `paste` method parameters and ensuring that transparency is preserved while converting RGBA PNG images to RGB format, the bug should be fixed. Now, the corrected function should properly handle transparency during image conversion.
