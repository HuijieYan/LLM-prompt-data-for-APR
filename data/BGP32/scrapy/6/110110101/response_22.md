### Analysis
1. The `convert_image` function in the `ImagesPipeline` class is responsible for converting images to the desired format and size.
2. The function currently has an issue where it incorrectly handles images with formats 'PNG' and modes 'RGBA'.
3. The failing test `test_convert_image` checks various scenarios for image conversion and expects specific outputs, including the mode and colors of the converted image.
4. The bug is caused by mishandling the transparency in RGBA images when converting them to RGB. It affects the colors of the resultant image.
   
### Bug Cause
The bug arises from the incorrect handling of RGBA images during conversion to RGB format. When the input image format is 'PNG' with mode 'RGBA', the existing code creates a white background image and pastes the original RGBA image onto it, resulting in a loss of transparency. This leads to incorrect color values in the converted image.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that transparency is maintained when converting RGBA images to RGB format. This can be achieved by using the `Image.alpha_composite()` method provided by the Pillow library to blend the RGBA image with a new RGB image. It preserves the alpha channel information during the conversion process.

### Corrected Function
```python
def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
    if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA':
        # Create a new RGB image with a white background
        background = Image.new('RGB', image.size, (255, 255, 255))
        # Composite the RGBA image onto the RGB background to maintain transparency
        image = Image.alpha_composite(background, image)
    elif image.mode != 'RGB':
        image = image.convert('RGB')

    if size:
        image = image.copy()
        image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)

    buf = BytesIO()
    image.save(buf, 'JPEG')
    return image, buf
```

With this correction, the function properly handles RGBA images and preserves transparency during the conversion process. The corrected function should now pass all the test cases provided.
