### Analysis
1. The buggy function `convert_image` within the `ImagesPipeline` class is responsible for converting images into the desired format, checking for transparency, and resizing images if specified.
2. The bug seems to occur in the conditional blocks where the image format and mode are checked, leading to incorrect image processing.
3. The failing test case is checking whether after conversion, the colors of the image match the expected values. It fails due to incorrect color conversion, resulting in different color values.
4. To fix the bug, we should ensure that the image conversion logic correctly handles transparency and image formats, maintaining the color values.
5. The corrected version of the function is provided below.

### Bug Fix
```python
# The corrected version of the buggy function
class ImagesPipeline(FilesPipeline):
    def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
        if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA':
            background = Image.new('RGB', image.size, (255, 255, 255))
            background.paste(image, (0, 0), image)
            image = background
        elif image.mode != 'RGB':
            image = image.convert('RGB')
    
        if size:
            image = image.copy()
            image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)
    
        buf = BytesIO()
        image.save(buf, 'JPEG')
        return image, buf
```

By correcting the function to handle transparency and RGB image formats correctly, the function should now pass the failing test case and provide the expected output values.
