### Analysis
1. The buggy function `convert_image` is meant to convert images to RGB format and generate thumbnails. It has conditional checks based on the image format and mode to perform appropriate conversions.
2. The bug seems to be located in the conditional block that handles PNG images with RGBA mode. The code is creating a new background image, pasting the original image onto it incorrectly, and then converting it to RGB.
3. The failing test expects specific colors after conversion which are incorrect due to the bug in handling transparent images.
4. To fix the bug, we need to correctly handle transparency in PNG images by separating the alpha channel before processing and pasting the images correctly.
5. I will provide a corrected version of the `convert_image` function below.

### Corrected Version of the `convert_image` Function
```python
# The corrected version of the buggy function
def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
    if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA':
        # Separate the alpha channel from the image
        image.load()  # Ensure image is loaded
        alpha = image.split()[3]
        background = Image.new('RGB', image.size, (255, 255, 255))
        background.paste(image, (0, 0), alpha)
        image = background
    elif image.mode != 'RGB':
        image = image.convert('RGB')

    if size:
        image = image.copy()
        image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)

    buf = BytesIO()
    image.save(buf, 'JPEG')
    return image, buf
```

By separating the alpha channel from the RGBA image before pasting it onto the background, we can maintain the desired colors and transparency in the final RGB image. This corrected version should now pass the failing test cases and produce the expected output.
