### Analysis
1. The buggy function `convert_image` in the `ImagesPipeline` class is responsible for converting images to the desired format and size.
2. The function has a bug in the first `if` condition where it checks if the image format is 'PNG' and mode is 'RGBA'. The logic to create a background image and paste the original image onto it is flawed.
3. The failing test `test_convert_image` checks the conversion for different scenarios including RGB and JPEG, resizing images, and handling transparency cases. The failing assertion is related to incorrect colors after image conversion.
4. The bug occurs due to incorrect handling of RGBA images, resulting in a color shift.
5. The fix involves properly pasting the RGBA image onto the background without affecting the colors.

### Fix
```python
class ImagesPipeline(FilesPipeline):

    def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
        if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA':
            background = Image.new('RGBA', image.size, (255, 255, 255, 255))
            background.paste(image, (0, 0), image)
            image = background.convert('RGB')
        elif image.mode != 'RGB':
            image = image.convert('RGB')
    
        if size:
            image = image.copy()
            image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)
    
        buf = BytesIO()
        image.save(buf, 'JPEG')
        return image, buf
```

By fixing the logic to correctly paste the RGBA image onto the background in the buggy function, it should now pass the failing test cases and produce the expected output colors.
