### Analysis
1. The `convert_image` function is part of the `ImagesPipeline` class, which is a subclass of `FilesPipeline`. The purpose of this function is to convert an image into RGB mode and resize it if a `size` parameter is provided.
2. There are potential errors in the conditional statements that check for image format and mode.
3. The failing test is trying to convert images of different formats and modes into RGB mode and check the colors of the resulting images. The failure occurs because the function is not converting images correctly.
4. To fix the bug, we need to address the issues in the conditional statements and ensure that the image format and mode are properly handled for all cases.

### Bug Fix
```python
from PIL import Image
from cStringIO import StringIO as BytesIO

class ImagesPipeline(FilesPipeline):
    """
    Abstract pipeline that implement the image thumbnail generation logic
    """

    def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
        if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA':
            background = Image.new('RGBA', image.size, (255, 255, 255))
            background.paste(image, (0, 0, image.size[0], image.size[1]))
            image = background.convert('RGB')
        elif image.mode != 'RGB':
            image = image.convert('RGB')
        
        if size:
            image = image.resize(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)
        
        buf = BytesIO()
        image.save(buf, 'JPEG')
        return image, buf
```

By fixing the conditional statements and handling image modes and formats correctly, the corrected function should now pass the failing test cases and return images in the expected format and mode.
