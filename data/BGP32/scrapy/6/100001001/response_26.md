### Analysis
1. The buggy function is designed to convert images to RGB format and resize them if a size parameter is provided.
2. The bug seems to be related to image conversion and resizing.
3. The bug causes incorrect image conversion or size adjustment, leading to unexpected outputs.
4. The strategy to fix the bug involves ensuring proper conversion based on image format and mode, as well as correctly resizing the image if needed.

### Bug Fix
Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
    if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA':
        background = Image.new('RGBA', image.size, (255, 255, 255))
        background.paste(image, (0, 0))
        image = background.convert('RGB')
    elif image.mode != 'RGB':
        image = image.convert('RGB')

    if size:
        image = image.copy()
        image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)

    buf = BytesIO()
    image.save(buf, 'JPEG')
    return image, buf
```

### Correction Explanation
- Modified `background.paste(image, image)` to `background.paste(image, (0, 0))` in the PNG RGBA conversion block to paste the image correctly.
- Ensured correct conversion and resizing based on input image format and mode.
- The function will now convert images to RGB format and resize them properly before saving as JPEG.
