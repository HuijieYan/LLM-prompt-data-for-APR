### Explanation of the Bug
The buggy function has multiple issues that lead to incorrect behavior:
1. The condition `if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA':` is not appropriate because the format should not dictate the mode, causing issues when the image is in PNG format but not in RGBA mode.
2. The line `background.paste(image, image)` should be corrected to `background.paste(image, (0, 0))` to paste the image correctly onto the background image.
3. The conversion logic for images that are not in RGB mode is not handled correctly, as it should convert them to RGB as mentioned in the code comment.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we should:
1. Remove the condition checking the image format before handling the mode conversion.
2. Update the paste operation to correctly paste the image onto the background.
3. Adjust the conversion logic for images that are not in RGB mode to ensure they are converted properly.

### Corrected Version of the Function
```python
def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
    if image.mode != 'RGB':
        image = image.convert('RGB')

    if size:
        image = image.copy()
        image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)

    buf = BytesIO()
    image.save(buf, 'JPEG')
    return image, buf
```
