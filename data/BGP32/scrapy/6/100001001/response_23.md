The bug in the provided function lies in the condition where it checks if the image format is 'PNG' and mode is 'RGBA'. The problem arises when it creates a new RGBA image instead of RGB, resulting in a buggy conversion. Additionally, the paste operation is incorrect, which is also contributing to the bug.

To fix the bug, we need to create a new RGB image instead of RGBA when the format is PNG and mode is 'RGBA'. Moreover, we should correctly paste the original image onto the new background image. Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
    if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA':
        background = Image.new('RGB', image.size, (255, 255, 255))
        background.paste(image, (0, 0), image)
        image = background
    elif image.mode != 'RGB':
        image = image.convert('RGB')

    if size:
        image = image.copy()
        image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)

    buf = BytesIO()
    image.save(buf, 'JPEG')
    return image, buf
```

With this correction, the function should now correctly handle PNG images with RGBA mode and convert them to RGB mode without any issues.
