### Bug Explanation:
The buggy function is intended to convert images to RGB mode and save them as JPEG files. However, there are a couple of issues present:
1. The condition to check if the image format is PNG and mode is RGBA is incorrect, as it should check if the image format is 'PNG' and mode is 'RGBA'. This issue can cause the function not to enter the block that converts PNG images to RGB mode.
2. In the block that converts PNG images to RGB mode, the paste method is being used incorrectly, which can result in unexpected behavior.

### Bug Fix:
To correct the issues mentioned above, we need to modify the buggy function as follows:

```python
def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
    if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA':
        background = Image.new('RGBA', image.size, (255, 255, 255))
        background.paste(image, (0, 0), image)
        image = background.convert('RGB')
    elif image.mode != 'RGB':
        image = image.convert('RGB')

    if size:
        image = image.copy()
        image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)

    buf = BytesIO()
    image.save(buf, 'JPEG')
    return image, buf
```

This corrected version fixes the issues with the condition check and the paste method usage, ensuring that the function correctly handles converting PNG images to RGB mode and saves images as JPEG files.
