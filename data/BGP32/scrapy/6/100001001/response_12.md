### Bug Explanation:
The bug in the `convert_image` function occurs because the condition checking for the format and mode of the input image is incorrect. The function assumes that if the format is 'PNG' and mode is 'RGBA', then the image should be converted to 'RGB'. However, this logic is flawed because the format of the image may not be directly related to its mode. This leads to incorrect conversions and output images.

### Bug Fix:
To fix the bug, we need to separate the conditions for checking the image format and mode. We can use the `image.format` attribute to check the format and the `image.mode` attribute to check the mode of the input image accurately. Additionally, we should handle the case where the format is 'PNG' and mode is 'RGBA' separately.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: scrapy/pipelines/images.py

def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
    if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA':
        background = Image.new('RGBA', image.size, (255, 255, 255))
        background.paste(image, (0, 0))
        image = background.convert('RGB')
    elif image.mode != 'RGB':
        image = image.convert('RGB')

    if size:
        image = image.copy()
        image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)

    buf = BytesIO()
    image.save(buf, 'JPEG')
    return image, buf
```

By separating the conditions for format and mode checks and correctly handling the conversion logic, the corrected function should now properly convert images without relying on incorrect assumptions.
