The bug in the `convert_image` function lies in the condition to check if the image format is PNG and mode is RGBA. The issue occurs when trying to handle PNG images with RGBA mode, where the function mistakenly creates a white background with RGBA mode instead of RGB, resulting in an error when trying to convert it to JPEG format.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the background is created with the correct mode (RGB) before pasting the image and converting it to RGB. Additionally, we need to properly handle the conversion of PNG images with RGBA mode to RGB before saving it as a JPEG image.

Here is the corrected version of the `convert_image` function:

```python
def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
    if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA':
        background = Image.new('RGB', image.size, (255, 255, 255))
        background.paste(image, image)
        image = background
    elif image.mode != 'RGB':
        image = image.convert('RGB')

    if size:
        image = image.copy()
        image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)

    buf = BytesIO()
    image.save(buf, 'JPEG')
    return image, buf
```

With this fix, the function now correctly handles PNG images with RGBA mode by creating a white background with RGB mode, pasting the image, and converting it to RGB before saving it as a JPEG image.
