### Explanation:
The bug in the provided function lies in the condition for converting PNG images with RGBA mode to RGB mode. The current implementation pastes the original image onto a new RGBA background image and then converts it to RGB. This process is incorrect as the paste method does not operate as expected, leading to incorrect outputs.

### Strategy for fixing the bug:
To fix the bug, we need to correct the way the conversion from PNG RGBA mode to RGB mode is done. Instead of pasting the image onto a new background, we would show the correct approach in the fixed function below.

### Corrected Version:

```python
def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
    if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA':
        image = image.convert('RGB')
    elif image.mode != 'RGB':
        image = image.convert('RGB')

    if size:
        image = image.copy()
        image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)

    buf = BytesIO()
    image.save(buf, 'JPEG')
    return image, buf
```

By directly converting PNG images with RGBA mode to RGB mode and correcting the handling of other image modes, this corrected version should now work correctly for the given cases.
