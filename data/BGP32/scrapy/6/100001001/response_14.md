### Bug Explanation
The bug in the provided function lies in the conditional check for the image format and mode. Specifically, the function checks if the image format is 'PNG' and the mode is 'RGBA' to create a new image with a white background and then convert it to RGB. However, the bug occurs when the format is 'JPEG' and mode is 'RGB', the function unnecessarily converts the image to RGB again, leading to potential quality loss.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to revise the conditional checks and adjustments made to the image based on the format and mode. The key is to ensure that unnecessary conversions are avoided and the image is processed correctly based on the given format and mode.

### Corrected Version of the Function
```python
def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
    if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA':
        background = Image.new('RGBA', image.size, (255, 255, 255))
        background.paste(image, (0, 0), image)
        image = background.convert('RGB')
    elif image.format == 'JPEG' and image.mode == 'RGB':
        # No need to convert 'RGB' images when format is 'JPEG'
        pass
    else:
        image = image.convert('RGB')

    if size:
        image = image.copy()
        image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)

    buf = BytesIO()
    image.save(buf, 'JPEG')
    return image, buf
```

In the corrected version:
1. If the image format is 'JPEG' and the mode is 'RGB', we skip the unnecessary conversion and simply proceed without any changes.
2. For other cases, when the mode is not 'RGB' or in the case of 'PNG' format with 'RGBA' mode, we apply the necessary transformations as before.
