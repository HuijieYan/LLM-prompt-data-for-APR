### Explanation of the Bug
The bug in the `convert_image` function arises due to the incorrect handling of the image format and mode. Specifically, the function is converting images to RGB format even when they are already in RGB format. This unnecessary conversion causes issues with the image processing.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug
To fix the bug, we need to update the function to check the format and mode of the input image correctly. If the image is already in the desired format and mode, we should avoid unnecessary conversions. Additionally, we should ensure that the image is processed correctly based on the given size parameter.

### Corrected Version of the Function
```python
def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
    if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA':
        background = Image.new('RGBA', image.size, (255, 255, 255))
        background.paste(image, (0, 0), image)
        image = background.convert('RGB')
    elif image.format == 'JPEG' and image.mode != 'RGB':
        image = image.convert('RGB')

    if size:
        image = image.copy()
        image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)

    buf = BytesIO()
    image.save(buf, 'JPEG')
    return image, buf
```

### Changes Made in the Correction
1. Updated the condition in the `if` block for converting images to RGB format to check both the format and mode of the image.
2. Added a condition to check if the image format is 'JPEG' before converting images to RGB mode to avoid unnecessary conversions.
3. Corrected the `paste` method by specifying the position to avoid the paste operation's failure.
4. Ensured that the image is processed correctly based on the provided size parameter.
