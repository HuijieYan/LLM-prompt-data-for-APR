The issue in the provided function `convert_image` is that the condition to check for a PNG image with RGBA mode is incorrectly written, leading to unexpected behavior. Additionally, the method used to paste the image onto a background in the first condition block is also incorrect.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
    if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA':
        background = Image.new('RGBA', image.size, (255, 255, 255))
        background.paste(image, (0, 0), image)
        image = background.convert('RGB')
    elif image.mode != 'RGB':
        image = image.convert('RGB')

    if size:
        image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)

    buf = BytesIO()
    image.save(buf, 'JPEG')
    return image, buf
```

The key changes include:
- Correcting the placement of the pasted image onto the background using `(0, 0)` coordinates.
- Ensuring to convert the PNG image with RGBA mode to RGB mode properly.
- Handling the case where the image has different modes other than RGB.

These modifications should address the identified issues and make the function work correctly for the provided test cases.
