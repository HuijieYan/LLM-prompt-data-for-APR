### Explanation:
The bug in the provided function lies in the conversion logic based on the image format and mode. The function is designed to convert images to RGB format, but the condition checking for PNG format with RGBA mode is incorrectly handling the process. Additionally, there is a mistake in the paste operation with the Image.new background, and also the incorrect use of the paste() method in Pillow.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Change the condition checking for PNG format with RGBA mode to correctly handle the conversion process.
2. Update the paste operation with the correct method to paste the original image on the background.
3. Use the correct method for thumbnailing the image if a size is provided.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
    if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA':
        background = Image.new('RGB', image.size, (255, 255, 255))
        background.paste(image, (0, 0), image)
        image = background
    elif image.mode != 'RGB':
        image = image.convert('RGB')

    if size:
        image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)

    buf = BytesIO()
    image.save(buf, 'JPEG')
    buf.seek(0)
    return image, buf
```

This corrected version of the function handles the image format and mode correctly and ensures the conversion process is done properly for different scenarios specified in the test cases.
