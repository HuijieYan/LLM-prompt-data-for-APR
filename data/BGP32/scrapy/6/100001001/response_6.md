## Explanation of the bug
The bug in the provided function lies in the conditional block where the image is transformed from RGBA to RGB format. In the case where the image format is PNG and the mode is RGBA, the function attempts to create a new RGB image by pasting the original RGBA image onto a new RGBA background. However, the `paste` method in PIL does not work as expected in this context, resulting in the creation of an incorrect RGB image.

## Strategy for fixing the bug
To fix the bug, the function should avoid using the `paste` method to transform RGBA images to RGB images. Instead, a proper conversion method should be used to maintain the integrity of the image data during the format modification.

## Corrected version of the function

```python
def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
    if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA':
        image = image.convert('RGB')
    elif image.mode != 'RGB':
        image = image.convert('RGB')

    if size:
        image = image.copy()
        image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)

    buf = BytesIO()
    image.save(buf, 'JPEG')
    return image, buf
``` 

In this corrected version, the function directly converts the image to RGB format using the `convert` method if the image is in PNG format and RGBA mode. This approach ensures the proper conversion of the image data without relying on the problematic `paste` method.
