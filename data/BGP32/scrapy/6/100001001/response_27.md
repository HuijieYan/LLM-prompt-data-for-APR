### Bug Analysis
The buggy function `convert_image` is intended to convert the input image to either RGB or RGBA mode, resize it if a size is provided, and save the image as a JPEG. The bug seems to be related to the conditional check for converting PNG images with RGBA mode to RGB mode.

1. In Case 1 and Case 2, the function fails to correctly check and handle images that are not PNG format or have an RGBA mode. It always attempts to convert the input image to RGB mode, leading to unnecessary processing.

2. In Case 3, when the input image is PNG format with RGBA mode, the code successfully converts it to RGB mode but fails to resize the image if a size is provided.

3. In Case 4, the function fails to handle images that are not PNG format or RGB mode, converting them directly to RGB without considering other modes.

### Bug Fix Strategy
1. Update the conditional check related to PNG format and RGBA mode to correctly handle the conversion process.
2. Ensure that the image is resized if a size is provided after the mode conversion.
3. Address cases where the input image is not PNG format or RGB mode and handle the conversion appropriately.

### Corrected Version of the Function
```python
def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
    if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA':
        background = Image.new('RGB', image.size, (255, 255, 255))
        background.paste(image, (0, 0))
        image = background
    elif image.mode != 'RGB':
        image = image.convert('RGB')

    if size:
        image = image.copy()
        image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)

    buf = BytesIO()
    image.save(buf, 'JPEG')
    return image, buf
``` 

By making these corrections, the function should now effectively handle different image formats and modes, resizing them as needed, and saving the final image as JPEG.
