The bug in the provided function is due to incorrect handling of the image format and mode conditions. Specifically, the function is mistakenly converting the image to 'RGB' mode in all cases where the image mode is not 'RGB', which is incorrect.

To fix the bug, we need to adjust the conditional checks and conversions based on the image format and mode. Additionally, we should ensure that the `image` variable is correctly updated at each stage.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
# The corrected version of the buggy function
def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
    if image.format.upper() == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA':
        background = Image.new('RGBA', image.size, (255, 255, 255))
        background.paste(image, image)
        image = background.convert('RGB')
    elif image.format.upper() != 'JPEG' or image.mode != 'RGB':
        image = image.convert('RGB')

    if size:
        image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)

    buf = BytesIO()
    image.save(buf, 'JPEG')
    return image, buf
```

In this corrected version, we handle the image format check by converting it to uppercase to avoid case sensitivity issues. We also adjust the mode check and conversion logic to ensure that the image is correctly processed based on the format and mode conditions.

These changes should address the bug and ensure that the function behaves correctly based on the provided input parameters and runtime values.
