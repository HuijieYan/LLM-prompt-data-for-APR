The bug in the provided function `request_httprepr` is likely to occur if the `request.body` is `None`, resulting in a `TypeError` when trying to concatenate it to bytes.

1. **Error Location**: The potential error location in the buggy function is the last line where `request.body` is concatenated to the byte string `s`.
   
2. **Cause of Bug**: The bug occurs because the `request.body` is directly concatenated to the byte string `s` without checking if `request.body` is `None`. If `request.body` is `None`, concatenating it directly will result in a `TypeError`.

3. **Strategy for Fixing the Bug**: To fix the bug, we need to check if `request.body` is `None` before concatenating it to the byte string `s`. If `request.body` is `None`, we should skip concatenating it to avoid the `TypeError`.

Here is the corrected version of the function `request_httprepr`:

```python
def request_httprepr(request):
    """Return the raw HTTP representation (as bytes) of the given request.
    This is provided only for reference since it's not the actual stream of
    bytes that will be send when performing the request (that's controlled
    by Twisted).
    """
    parsed = urlparse_cached(request)
    path = urlunparse(('', '', parsed.path or '/', parsed.params, parsed.query, ''))
    s = to_bytes(request.method) + b" " + to_bytes(path) + b" HTTP/1.1\r\n"
    s += b"Host: " + to_bytes(parsed.hostname) + b"\r\n"
    if request.headers:
        s += request.headers.to_string() + b"\r\n"
    s += b"\r\n"
    if request.body is not None:
        s += request.body
    return s
```

This corrected version includes a check `if request.body is not None:` before concatenating `request.body` to ensure that the bug causing a `TypeError` when `request.body` is `None` is fixed.
