## Analysis:
The buggy function is `request_httprepr(request)` which is supposed to return the raw HTTP representation of the given request as bytes. The function uses various methods from the imported modules to construct the HTTP representation.

## Potential Error Locations:
1. The usage of `urlparse_cached(request)` may cause issues if `request` is not a valid URL.
2. The construction of the `path` variable may not handle all cases correctly.
3. There could be issues with concatenating byte strings in the `s` variable.
4. Accessing `parsed.hostname` without checking for its existence may lead to errors.

## Cause of the Bug:
The bug could potentially occur due to incorrect handling of URL parsing, construction of the path, concatenation of byte strings, and accessing attributes of `parsed` without proper checks.

## Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
1. Check if the `request` parameter is a valid URL before parsing it.
2. Handle cases where `parsed.hostname` is not available.
3. Use proper encoding and concatenation methods for byte strings.

## Corrected Version:
```python
def request_httprepr(request):
    """Return the raw HTTP representation (as bytes) of the given request.
    This is provided only for reference since it's not the actual stream of
    bytes that will be send when performing the request (that's controlled
    by Twisted).
    """
    parsed = urlparse_cached(request.url)  # Parse the URL from the request
    if not parsed.hostname:  # Check if hostname exists
        raise ValueError("Invalid URL provided")
    
    path = urlunparse(('', '', parsed.path or '/', parsed.params, parsed.query, ''))

    method_bytes = to_bytes(request.method)
    path_bytes = to_bytes(path)
    host_bytes = b"Host: " + to_bytes(parsed.hostname) + b"\r\n"

    headers_bytes = b""
    if request.headers:
        headers_bytes = request.headers.to_string() + b"\r\n"

    body_bytes = request.body if request.body else b""

    return method_bytes + b" " + path_bytes + b" HTTP/1.1\r\n" + host_bytes + headers_bytes + b"\r\n" + body_bytes
``` 

This corrected version checks for the presence of a valid hostname before processing the request. It handles the encoding and concatenation of byte strings in a more robust manner.
