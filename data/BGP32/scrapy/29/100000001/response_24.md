### Analysis:
1. The `urlparse_cached` function is being used to parse the URL from the request object.
2. The `urlunparse` function is being used to reconstruct the URL path without the scheme and netloc.
3. The `to_bytes` function is being used to encode strings to bytes.
4. There is a concatenation of byte strings without encoding in the line `s += request.headers.to_string() + b"\r\n"` which might lead to encoding issues.
5. The `request.body` is directly appended to the byte string without encoding, which may result in encoding errors.

### Bug Cause:
The bug in the function arises due to concatenating byte strings and potential encoding issues in the lines mentioned above. Directly appending the `request.body` without proper encoding may cause errors if the body content is not in a compatible format.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, ensure that the concatenation of byte strings is done correctly by encoding each string before concatenation. For the `request.headers.to_string()` and `request.body`, make sure to encode them to bytes before appending to the resulting byte string.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def request_httprepr(request):
    """Return the raw HTTP representation (as bytes) of the given request.
    This is provided only for reference since it's not the actual stream of
    bytes that will be sent when performing the request (that's controlled
    by Twisted).
    """
    parsed = urlparse_cached(request)
    path = urlunparse(('', '', parsed.path or '/', parsed.params, parsed.query, ''))
    
    s = to_bytes(request.method) + b" " + to_bytes(path) + b" HTTP/1.1\r\n"
    s += b"Host: " + to_bytes(parsed.hostname) + b"\r\n"
    
    if request.headers:
        s += to_bytes(request.headers.to_string()) + b"\r\n"
    
    s += b"\r\n"
    s += to_bytes(request.body)
    
    return s
```

In the corrected version, all string concatenations are handled by encoding the strings to bytes using the `to_bytes` function to prevent potential encoding issues.
