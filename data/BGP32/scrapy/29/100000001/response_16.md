The bug in the provided function is likely related to how the HTTP request representation is being built. The issue seems to be with the `to_bytes()` function and how it's handling the conversion of the `path` and `hostname` values.

The cause of the bug could be that the `path` and `hostname` values are not being properly encoded or converted to bytes before being concatenated with other byte strings in the process of constructing the HTTP request representation.

To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the `path` and `hostname` values are correctly converted to bytes using the `to_bytes()` function before concatenating them with other byte strings.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def request_httprepr(request):
    """Return the raw HTTP representation (as bytes) of the given request.
    This is provided only for reference since it's not the actual stream of
    bytes that will be sent when performing the request (that's controlled
    by Twisted).
    """
    parsed = urlparse_cached(request)
    path = urlunparse(('', '', parsed.path or '/', parsed.params, parsed.query, ''))
    hostname = parsed.hostname.encode('utf-8') if parsed.hostname else b''
    
    s = to_bytes(request.method) + b" " + to_bytes(path) + b" HTTP/1.1\r\n"
    s += b"Host: " + hostname + b"\r\n"
    
    if request.headers:
        s += request.headers.to_string() + b"\r\n"
    
    s += b"\r\n"
    s += request.body
    
    return s
``` 

In this corrected version, we explicitly encode the `parsed.hostname` value to utf-8 bytes and handle the `path` and `hostname` conversion properly before building the raw HTTP representation. This should fix the bug in the original function.
