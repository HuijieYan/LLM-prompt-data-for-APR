### Analysis:
The buggy function `request_httprepr` is designed to return the raw HTTP representation of a given request as bytes. The function first parses the request using `urlparse_cached`, then constructs the path, method, hostname, headers, and body of the HTTP request. Finally, it concatenates all the parts and returns the HTTP representation as bytes.

### Identified Potential Errors:
1. The `parsed` object is being used directly without checking if it is `None`.
2. The `parsed.hostname` is being accessed without checking if the parsed object has a hostname attribute.
3. The headers are converted to bytes, but it's not clear if the headers are already in bytes or need to be encoded.

### Cause of the Bug:
The bug arises when the parsed object is `None` (for example, in the case of a malformed URL), or when the parsed object does not have a `hostname` attribute, leading to potential errors while constructing the raw HTTP representation.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
1. Check if the `parsed` object is `None` before accessing its attributes.
2. Check if the `parsed` object has a `hostname` attribute before accessing it.
3. Ensure that the headers are properly encoded to bytes before concatenating them with the HTTP representation.

### Corrected Version:
Here is the corrected version of the `request_httprepr` function:

```python
def request_httprepr(request):
    parsed = urlparse_cached(request)
    
    if parsed is None:  # Checking if parsed object is None
        return b''
    
    path = urlunparse(('', '', parsed.path or '/', parsed.params, parsed.query, ''))
    hostname = getattr(parsed, 'hostname', '')  # Accessing hostname attribute safely
    method_bytes = to_bytes(request.method)
    path_bytes = to_bytes(path)
    hostname_bytes = to_bytes(hostname)
    
    http_parts = [
        method_bytes + b" " + path_bytes + b" HTTP/1.1\r\n",
        b"Host: " + hostname_bytes + b"\r\n"
    ]

    if request.headers:
        headers = request.headers.to_string()
        if isinstance(headers, str):  # Ensuring headers are bytes
            headers = headers.encode('utf-8')
        http_parts.append(headers + b"\r\n")
    
    http_parts.extend([b"\r\n", request.body])
    
    http_representation = b''.join(http_parts)

    return http_representation
```

In this corrected version, we have added validations to handle cases where the `parsed` object is `None` and where the `parsed` object does not have a `hostname` attribute. We have also ensured that the headers are properly encoded to bytes before concatenating them with the HTTP representation.
