The buggy function has a few potential error locations that need to be addressed:
1. The function is using `urlparse_cached` to parse the request's URL, but `parsed.path` might be `None` leading to a potential error when trying to access it to retrieve the path.
2. The function is constructing the `path` variable using `urlunparse`, but it is not handling all the components correctly.
3. The function is trying to concatenate bytes and strings directly which may cause encoding issues.

To fix these issues, we can modify the function as follows:

```python
def request_httprepr(request):
    parsed = urlparse_cached(request)
    
    path = parsed.path if parsed.path else '/'
    path = path + '?' + parsed.query if parsed.query else ''
    
    method = to_bytes(request.method)
    host = to_bytes(parsed.hostname)
    
    headers = b""
    if request.headers:
        headers = request.headers.to_string()
    
    body = request.body if request.body else b""
    
    http_request = f"{method} {path} HTTP/1.1\r\nHost: {host}\r\n{headers}\r\n\r\n".encode('utf-8') + body
    return http_request
```

This corrected version handles the optional parts of the URL correctly, encodes all strings into bytes when necessary, and properly constructs the raw HTTP representation of the given request.
