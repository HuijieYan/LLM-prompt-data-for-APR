After analyzing the buggy function `request_httprepr`, there are several potential error locations that could cause bugs:
1. The `urlparse_cached` function might not return the expected parsed URL object.
2. The `to_bytes` and `to_native_str` functions might not handle the input data correctly.
3. The concatenation of byte strings in building the raw HTTP representation could result in incorrect or missing data.
4. There may be issues with handling the request headers or body data.

The bug in the function is caused by potential encoding issues with converting the request method, path, hostname, headers, and body into bytes. This could lead to errors or unexpected behavior when concatenating these data pieces to construct the raw HTTP representation.

To fix this bug, ensure proper encoding and handling of data conversions to bytes. Verify that the input data is correctly processed before concatenation. Update the function to handle conversion errors or missing data gracefully to avoid exceptions.

Here is a corrected version of the `request_httprepr` function:

```python
def request_httprepr(request):
    """Return the raw HTTP representation (as bytes) of the given request.
    This is provided only for reference since it's not the actual stream of
    bytes that will be send when performing the request (that's controlled
    by Twisted).
    """
    parsed = urlparse_cached(request)
    path = urlunparse(('', '', parsed.path or '/', parsed.params, parsed.query, ''))
    method_bytes = to_bytes(request.method)
    path_bytes = to_bytes(path)
    hostname_bytes = to_bytes(parsed.hostname)

    headers_bytes = b""
    if request.headers:
        headers_bytes = request.headers.to_string()

    body_bytes = b""
    if request.body:
        body_bytes = request.body

    http_repr = method_bytes + b" " + path_bytes + b" HTTP/1.1\r\n"
    http_repr += b"Host: " + hostname_bytes + b"\r\n"
    http_repr += headers_bytes + b"\r\n\r\n"
    http_repr += body_bytes

    return http_repr
```

In this corrected version, each data component (method, path, hostname, headers, and body) is converted to bytes separately and handled carefully before concatenation to construct the raw HTTP representation. This approach ensures that each part of the HTTP representation is correctly encoded and avoids potential encoding issues that could lead to bugs.
