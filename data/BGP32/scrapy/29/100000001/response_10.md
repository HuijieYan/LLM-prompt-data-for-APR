The potential error in the buggy function lies in concatenating byte strings and Unicode strings without proper encoding, leading to a TypeError. The issue arises in the lines where `to_bytes` function is used to convert strings to bytes, but the concatenation is not handled correctly.

To fix this bug, we need to ensure that all concatenations involve bytes objects. One way to do this is to encode all Unicode strings to bytes before concatenation.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def request_httprepr(request):
    """Return the raw HTTP representation (as bytes) of the given request.
    This is provided only for reference since it's not the actual stream of
    bytes that will be send when performing the request (that's controlled
    by Twisted).
    """
    parsed = urlparse_cached(request)
    path = urlunparse(('', '', parsed.path or '/', parsed.params, parsed.query, ''))
    s = to_bytes(request.method) + b" " + to_bytes(path) + b" HTTP/1.1\r\n"
    s += b"Host: " + to_bytes(parsed.hostname) + b"\r\n"
    if request.headers:
        s += to_bytes(request.headers.to_string()) + b"\r\n"
    s += b"\r\n"
    s += request.body
    return s
``` 

This corrected version ensures that all string concatenations involve bytes objects, avoiding the TypeError that could occur due to mixing bytes and Unicode strings.
