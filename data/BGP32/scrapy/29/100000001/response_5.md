### Analysis:
The buggy function `request_httprepr()` is designed to return the raw HTTP representation of the given request as bytes. However, there are potential error locations within the function that need to be addressed.
1. `parsed.hostname` may raise an exception if `hostname` is not present in `parsed`.
2. `request.headers` may raise an exception if `headers` is None.

### Cause of the Bug:
The potential causes of the bug in the function are:
1. If `parsed.hostname` is not present, trying to access it will throw an AttributeError.
2. If `request.headers` is `None`, trying to call `to_string()` on it will result in an AttributeError.

### Fix Strategy:
1. Check if `parsed.hostname` exists before trying to access it to avoid AttributeError.
2. Check if `request.headers` is not `None` before trying to access it or call any method on it to avoid AttributeError.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def request_httprepr(request):
    """Return the raw HTTP representation (as bytes) of the given request.
    This is provided only for reference since it's not the actual stream of
    bytes that will be send when performing the request (that's controlled
    by Twisted).
    """
    parsed = urlparse_cached(request)
    path = urlunparse(('', '', parsed.path or '/', parsed.params, parsed.query, ''))
    s = to_bytes(request.method) + b" " + to_bytes(path) + b" HTTP/1.1\r\n"
    
    # Check if parsed.hostname exists before accessing it
    if parsed.hostname:
        s += b"Host: " + to_bytes(parsed.hostname) + b"\r\n"
    
    if request.headers:
        s += request.headers.to_string() + b"\r\n"
    
    s += b"\r\n"
    s += request.body
    return s
```

In this corrected version, we added a check to ensure that `parsed.hostname` exists before using it. Additionally, we included a check to ensure that `request.headers` is not `None` before accessing it. These checks prevent AttributeError from occurring and address the potential bugs in the original function.
