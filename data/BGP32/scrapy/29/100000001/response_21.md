### Analysis:

The buggy function `request_httprepr` is meant to return the raw HTTP representation (as bytes) of a given request. The function parses the URL of the request, constructs the path, adds the method, hostname, headers, and body to form the HTTP representation.

### Potential error locations:
1. `urlunparse` function being called with invalid arguments.
2. Concatenating bytes and strings in an unsupported way.
3. Concatenating `request.headers.to_string()` directly without converting to bytes.
4. Handling of `request.body`.

### Bug Explanation:
The bug in this function is due to the misuse of `urlunparse` function where the parsed URL components are passed in the incorrect order for reconstructing the URL. This can result in incorrect path construction for the HTTP request.

Additionally, the concatenation of strings and bytes directly without conversion can lead to errors and unexpected behavior in Python 3.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Correct the order of arguments passed to `urlunparse` function to ensure proper URL path construction.
2. Convert strings to bytes where necessary for concatenation.
3. Convert `request.headers.to_string()` to bytes before concatenating.
4. Ensure proper handling of `request.body`.

### Corrected Version:

```python
def request_httprepr(request):
    """Return the raw HTTP representation (as bytes) of the given request.
    This is provided only for reference since it's not the actual stream of
    bytes that will be send when performing the request (that's controlled
    by Twisted).
    """
    parsed = urlparse_cached(request)
    path = urlunparse(('', '', parsed.path or '', '', '', ''))
    s = to_bytes(request.method) + b" " + to_bytes(path) + b" HTTP/1.1\r\n"
    s += b"Host: " + to_bytes(parsed.hostname) + b"\r\n"
    if request.headers:
        s += to_bytes(request.headers.to_string()) + b"\r\n"
    s += b"\r\n"
    if request.body:
        s += to_bytes(request.body)
    return s
```

In the corrected version:
- The arguments to `urlunparse` function are adjusted to have the correct order.
- Strings are converted to bytes using `to_bytes` before concatenation.
- `request.headers.to_string()` is converted to bytes before concatenation.
- Proper handling of `request.body` is included.
