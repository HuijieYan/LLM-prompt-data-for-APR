### Analysis:
The buggy function `request_httprepr(request)` is designed to generate the raw HTTP representation for a given request. The function uses various functions like `urlparse_cached`, `urlunparse`, `to_bytes`, etc., to construct the HTTP request string. 

### Potential Error Locations:
1. `urlparse_cached` may not return the expected result, leading to issues in constructing the URL.
2. Concatenating the parts of the HTTP request may lead to unexpected results, especially if any part is `None`.
3. The usage of `request.headers.to_string()` may cause issues if `request.headers` is not properly formatted as expected.
4. Appending `request.body` directly to the HTTP request string may cause encoding issues or incorrect data in the body.

### Cause of Bug:
The bug in the function may arise from improper handling or concatenation of URL components, headers, or body, leading to incorrect HTTP representation.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, it is essential to ensure proper handling of each component in the HTTP request. Validate each part and handle edge cases to prevent unexpected behavior.

### Corrected Version:
Here's the corrected version of the `request_httprepr(request)` function:

```python
def request_httprepr(request):
    """Return the raw HTTP representation (as bytes) of the given request.
    This is provided only for reference since it's not the actual stream of
    bytes that will be sent when performing the request (that's controlled
    by Twisted).
    """
    parsed = urlparse_cached(request)
    
    path = urlunparse(('', '', parsed.path or '/', parsed.params, parsed.query, ''))
    
    method_bytes = to_bytes(request.method)
    path_bytes = to_bytes(path)
    host_bytes = b"Host: " + to_bytes(parsed.hostname) + b"\r\n"
    
    headers_bytes = b""
    if request.headers:
        headers_bytes = request.headers.to_string()
    
    body_bytes = b""
    if request.body:
        body_bytes = request.body
    
    http_repr = method_bytes + b" " + path_bytes + b" HTTP/1.1\r\n"
    http_repr += b"Host: " + host_bytes + b"\r\n"
    http_repr += headers_bytes + b"\r\n"
    http_repr += b"\r\n"
    http_repr += body_bytes
    
    return http_repr
```

In the corrected version:
- Each component of the HTTP request (method, path, headers, body) is converted to bytes separately.
- Empty checks are added for `path`, `headers`, and `body` to avoid concatenating `None`.
- The HTTP request string is constructed by concatenating the separate parts.
