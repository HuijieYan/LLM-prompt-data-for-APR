The potential error in the buggy function is in the line `s += request.headers.to_string() + b"\r\n"`. It seems that `to_string()` method of the `headers` object is not converting the headers to bytes correctly, which is causing an encoding issue when concatenating with other byte strings.

To fix this bug, we can modify the `to_string()` method to return the headers as bytes directly. Below is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def request_httprepr(request):
    """Return the raw HTTP representation (as bytes) of the given request.
    This is provided only for reference since it's not the actual stream of
    bytes that will be sent when performing the request (that's controlled
    by Twisted).
    """
    parsed = urlparse_cached(request)
    path = urlunparse(('', '', parsed.path or '/', parsed.params, parsed.query, ''))
    s = to_bytes(request.method) + b" " + to_bytes(path) + b" HTTP/1.1\r\n"
    s += b"Host: " + to_bytes(parsed.hostname) + b"\r\n"
    if request.headers:
        s += to_bytes(request.headers) + b"\r\n"  # Corrected this line
    s += b"\r\n"
    s += request.body
    return s
```

In the corrected version, we have changed `request.headers.to_string()` to `to_bytes(request.headers)` to directly convert the headers to bytes. This should resolve the encoding issue and produce the correct raw HTTP representation of the request.
