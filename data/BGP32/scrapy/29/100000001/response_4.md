The bug in the provided function `request_httprepr` is likely to be when concatenating the different parts of the HTTP request into `s`.

The potential error locations within the buggy function are:
1. `s += request.headers.to_string() + b"\r\n"` could cause an error if `request.headers` is None.
2. `s += request.body` could also cause an error if `request.body` is None.

The cause of the bug is that the function does not handle the cases where `request.headers` and `request.body` are None. When attempting to concatenate these values to `s`, it would result in a `TypeError`.

To fix this bug, we can add condition checks to ensure that `request.headers` and `request.body` are not None before concatenating them to `s`.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def request_httprepr(request):
    parsed = urlparse_cached(request)
    path = urlunparse(('', '', parsed.path or '/', parsed.params, parsed.query, ''))
    s = to_bytes(request.method) + b" " + to_bytes(path) + b" HTTP/1.1\r\n"
    s += b"Host: " + to_bytes(parsed.hostname) + b"\r\n"
    
    if request.headers:
        s += request.headers.to_string() + b"\r\n"
    
    s += b"\r\n"
    
    if request.body:
        s += request.body
    
    return s
```

In the corrected version, we added condition checks to ensure that `request.headers` and `request.body` are not None before attempting to concatenate them. This prevents `TypeError` from occurring if these values are None.
