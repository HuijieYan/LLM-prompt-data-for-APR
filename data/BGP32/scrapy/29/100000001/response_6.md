After analyzing the buggy function, it seems that the potential error locations could be:

1. The use of `to_bytes` and `to_native_str` functions for encoding and decoding the request components might cause encoding issues.
2. The `urlparse_cached` function might not return the expected parsed URL components.

The cause of the bug in the provided function is that the `urlparse_cached` function might not return the expected parsed URL components due to incorrect parsing or caching issues. This can lead to errors when constructing the raw HTTP representation of the request.

To fix the bug, it is recommended to directly parse the URL components using the `urllib.parse` module and construct the raw HTTP representation in a more reliable way.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
# The corrected version of the function
from urllib.parse import urlparse

def request_httprepr(request):
    """Return the raw HTTP representation (as bytes) of the given request.
    This is provided only for reference since it's not the actual stream of
    bytes that will be sent when performing the request (that's controlled
    by Twisted).
    """
    parsed = urlparse(request.url)
    path = parsed.path or '/'
    if parsed.params:
        path += ';' + parsed.params
    if parsed.query:
        path += '?' + parsed.query
    s = to_bytes(request.method) + b" " + to_bytes(path) + b" HTTP/1.1\r\n"
    s += b"Host: " + to_bytes(parsed.hostname) + b"\r\n"
    if request.headers:
        s += request.headers.to_string() + b"\r\n"
    s += b"\r\n"
    s += request.body
    return s
```

In this corrected version, the raw HTTP representation is constructed using the parsed components from the URL directly using `urlparse` from the `urllib.parse` module. This ensures accurate parsing of the URL components and avoids potential caching issues.
