## Analysis:
The `request_httprepr` function is intended to return the raw HTTP representation (as bytes) of the given request. However, there are potential error locations within the function:
1. `urlparse_cached(request)` may not return the expected `parsed` URL result.
2. The creation of `path` by using `urlunparse` might be incorrect.
3. There is a possibility of an error when concatenating the `s` byte string.

## Bug Cause:
The `urlparse_cached(request)` function might not parse the URL correctly, leading to issues in constructing the `path`. Additionally, incorrect concatenation of byte strings in `s` could cause errors in creating the raw HTTP representation.

## Fix Strategy:
1. Verify the `urlparse_cached(request)` function to ensure the parsed URL is correct.
2. Check the construction of the `path` using `urlunparse` to create the correct URL path.
3. Use proper byte string concatenation methods to avoid errors in constructing the raw HTTP representation.

## Corrected Version:
```python
def request_httprepr(request):
    parsed = urlparse_cached(request)
    path = urlunparse(('', '', parsed.path or '/', parsed.params, parsed.query, ''))
    host = to_bytes(parsed.hostname)
    method = to_bytes(request.method)
    
    # Prepare the HTTP request string
    lines = []
    lines.append(method + b" " + path + b" HTTP/1.1")
    lines.append(b"Host: " + host)
    if request.headers:
        lines.append(request.headers.to_string())
    lines.append(b"")
    lines.append(request.body)
    
    return b"\r\n".join(lines)
```

In this corrected version:
- The hostname is converted to bytes separately.
- The method is also converted to bytes separately.
- The byte strings are appended to a list `lines`.
- The final raw HTTP representation is created by joining the lines with b"\r\n".

This revised function eliminates the potential errors present in the original code by handling the byte string concatenation correctly and ensuring a proper raw HTTP representation is generated.
