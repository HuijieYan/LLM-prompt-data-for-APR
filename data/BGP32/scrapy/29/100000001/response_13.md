The bug in the provided function `request_httprepr` is in the following line:
```python
path = urlunparse(('', '', parsed.path or '/', parsed.params, parsed.query, ''))
```

The issue is that the `urlunparse` function expects a tuple of size 6 as an argument, but the code above is passing a tuple of size 7. This leads to a `TypeError`.

To fix this bug, we need to adjust the tuple size to 6. Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def request_httprepr(request):
    """Return the raw HTTP representation (as bytes) of the given request.
    This is provided only for reference since it's not the actual stream of
    bytes that will be sent when performing the request (that's controlled
    by Twisted).
    """
    parsed = urlparse_cached(request)
    path_tuple = ('', '', parsed.path or '/', parsed.params, parsed.query, '')
    path = urlunparse(path_tuple)
    s = to_bytes(request.method) + b" " + to_bytes(path) + b" HTTP/1.1\r\n"
    s += b"Host: " + to_bytes(parsed.hostname) + b"\r\n"
    if request.headers:
        s += request.headers.to_string() + b"\r\n"
    s += b"\r\n"
    s += request.body
    return s
```

In the corrected version, the tuple `path_tuple` is created with the correct size of 6 elements and passed to `urlunparse` function. This should fix the bug and the function should work correctly now.
