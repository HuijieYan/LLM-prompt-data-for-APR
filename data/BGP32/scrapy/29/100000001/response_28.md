### Analysis:
The buggy function `request_httprepr` is designed to generate the raw HTTP representation (as bytes) of a given request. The function seems to have potential errors in the following areas:
1. The `urlparse_cached` function is used incorrectly, potentially leading to issues with parsing the URL.
2. The construction of the `path` variable using `urlunparse` may not correctly generate the desired path.
3. Combining and encoding different parts (method, path, headers, body) of the HTTP request into bytes may encounter encoding errors.

### Bug Cause:
The function may be experiencing issues due to incorrect URL parsing using `urlparse_cached`, potential misinterpretation of the path using `urlunparse`, and encoding problems when combining different request parts into bytes.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
1. Use `urlparse` from `six.moves.urllib.parse` for more accurate URL parsing.
2. Review the construction of the `path` variable, considering the correct representation of the URL path.
3. Ensure proper encoding of each part of the HTTP request when combining them into bytes.

### Corrected Version:
```python
from six.moves.urllib.parse import urlparse
from six.moves.urllib.parse import urlunparse
from scrapy.utils.python import to_bytes, to_native_str

def request_httprepr(request):
    """Return the raw HTTP representation (as bytes) of the given request.
    This is provided only for reference since it's not the actual stream of
    bytes that will be send when performing the request (that's controlled
    by Twisted).
    """
    parsed = urlparse(request.url)
    path = urlunparse(('', '', parsed.path or '/', parsed.params, parsed.query, ''))
    s = to_bytes(request.method) + b" " + to_bytes(path) + b" HTTP/1.1\r\n"
    s += b"Host: " + to_bytes(parsed.hostname) + b"\r\n"
    if request.headers:
        s += request.headers.to_string() + b"\r\n"
    s += b"\r\n"
    s += to_bytes(request.body)
    return s
```

In the corrected version above:
- Replaced `urlparse_cached` with `urlparse` for accurate URL parsing.
- Ensured proper construction of the `path` variable for the correct representation of the URL path.
- Made sure to encode each part of the HTTP request correctly before combining them into bytes.
