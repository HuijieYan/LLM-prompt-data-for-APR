## Analysis:
The buggy function `request_httprepr` aims to return the raw HTTP representation of a given request, as bytes. However, there is a bug in the function that causes an error. 

## Potential Error Locations:
1. The usage of `urlparse_cached` function may not return the expected result.
2. The construction of the request line may have issues with parsing the path.
3. Concatenating byte strings might cause encoding issues.
4. The handling of headers and body of the request could lead to unexpected behavior.

## Bug Cause:
The bug in the function may be due to incorrect parsing of the request URL, misalignment in constructing the HTTP request line, potential encoding issues with byte concatenation, or incorrect handling of headers and body.

## Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
1. Ensure that the `urlparse_cached` function correctly parses the request URL.
2. Pay attention to constructing the request line (method, path, protocol version).
3. Use proper encoding conversion for byte strings concatenation.
4. Review the handling of headers and request body to ensure proper format.

## Corrected Version:
```python
def request_httprepr(request):
    """Return the raw HTTP representation (as bytes) of the given request.
    This is provided only for reference since it's not the actual stream of
    bytes that will be send when performing the request (that's controlled
    by Twisted).
    """
    parsed = urlparse_cached(request.url)
    path = urlunparse(('', '') + (parsed.path or '/', parsed.params, parsed.query, '', ''))
    
    method_bytes = to_bytes(request.method)
    path_bytes = to_bytes(path)
    protocol_bytes = b"HTTP/1.1\r\n"
    
    header_bytes = b"Host: " + to_bytes(parsed.hostname) + b"\r\n"
    if request.headers:
        header_bytes += request.headers.to_string() + b"\r\n"
    
    body_bytes = b""
    if request.body:
        body_bytes = request.body
    
    return b"".join([method_bytes, b" ", path_bytes, b, protocol_bytes, header_bytes, b"\r\n", body_bytes])
``` 

In the corrected version:
1. The URL parsing is adjusted to use `urlparse_cached(request.url)` instead of just `urlparse_cached(request)`.
2. The construction of the request line has been corrected with proper byte encoding.
3. Headers and request body handling are improved to concatenate correctly.

This corrected version should address the bug and provide the expected raw HTTP representation of the given request.
