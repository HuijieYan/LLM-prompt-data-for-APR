The bug in the provided function `request_httprepr` is caused by the incorrect concatenation of `None` type with bytes in the line `path = urlunparse(('', '', parsed.path or '/', parsed.params, parsed.query, ''))`. If `parsed.path` is `None`, the concatenation with `b""` (empty bytes) will result in a TypeError. 

To fix this bug, we can handle the case where `parsed.path` is `None` and replace it with `'/'` before the concatenation.

Here is the corrected version of the function `request_httprepr`:
```python
def request_httprepr(request):
    """Return the raw HTTP representation (as bytes) of the given request.
    This is provided only for reference since it's not the actual stream of
    bytes that will be send when performing the request (that's controlled
    by Twisted).
    """
    parsed = urlparse_cached(request)
    path = parsed.path or '/'
    path = urlunparse(('', '', path, parsed.params, parsed.query, ''))
    s = to_bytes(request.method) + b" " + to_bytes(path) + b" HTTP/1.1\r\n"
    s += b"Host: " + to_bytes(parsed.hostname) + b"\r\n"
    if request.headers:
        s += request.headers.to_string() + b"\r\n"
    s += b"\r\n"
    s += request.body
    return s
``` 

In this corrected version, we handle the case where `parsed.path` is `None` by setting it to `'/'` before passing it to `urlunparse`. This ensures that the concatenation with empty bytes does not lead to a TypeError.
