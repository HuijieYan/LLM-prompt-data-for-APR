### Analysis:
The buggy function `request_httprepr` is intended to return a raw HTTP representation of the given request. It constructs the HTTP request string by combining the method, path, hostname, headers, and body of the request object. However, there is a bug in the function that causes an error when `request.headers` is not `None`. The concatenation of bytes and string using `+` operator in Python 3 raises a `TypeError`. 

### Potential Error Locations:
1. Concatenation of bytes and string in the `if request.headers` block.
2. Unnecessary concatenation using `+=` multiple times.

### Cause of the Bug:
The bug is caused by mixing bytes and string concatenation in Python 3, which is not allowed. In the buggy function, when `request.headers` is not `None`, the concatenation operation inside the `if` block results in a `TypeError` due to mixing bytes and strings.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that all operations involving bytes and strings are properly encoded. We can encode the string literals to bytes before concatenating them with byte objects.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def request_httprepr(request):
    """Return the raw HTTP representation (as bytes) of the given request."""
    parsed = urlparse_cached(request)
    path = urlunparse(('', '', parsed.path or '/', parsed.params, parsed.query, ''))
    s = to_bytes(request.method) + b" " + to_bytes(path) + b" HTTP/1.1\r\n"
    s += b"Host: " + to_bytes(parsed.hostname) + b"\r\n"
    if request.headers:
        s += to_bytes(request.headers.to_string()) + b"\r\n"
    s += b"\r\n"
    s += request.body
    return s
```

In the corrected version of the function, all string literals are properly encoded to bytes using `to_bytes` function before concatenation. This ensures that the types are consistent and eliminates the `TypeError` caused by mixing bytes and strings.
