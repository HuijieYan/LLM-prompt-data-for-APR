## Analysis:
The bug in the provided function `request_httprepr` stems from the line that concatenates the request body (`request.body`) to the raw HTTP representation. This line assumes that `request.body` is already in bytes format, leading to encoding issues. 

## Potential Error Location:
The bug is located in the line:
```python
s += request.body
```

## Cause of the Bug:
The bug occurs because `request.body` may not be in bytes format, causing issues when trying to concatenate it directly to the raw HTTP representation `s` which is in bytes format.

## Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that `request.body` is encoded correctly to bytes format before concatenating it to the raw HTTP representation.

## Corrected Version:
```python
def request_httprepr(request):
    parsed = urlparse_cached(request)
    path = urlunparse(('', '', parsed.path or '/', parsed.params, parsed.query, ''))
    s = to_bytes(request.method) + b" " + to_bytes(path) + b" HTTP/1.1\r\n"
    s += b"Host: " + to_bytes(parsed.hostname) + b"\r\n"
    if request.headers:
        s += request.headers.to_string() + b"\r\n"
    s += b"\r\n"
    if isinstance(request.body, bytes):
        s += request.body
    else:
        s += to_bytes(request.body)
    return s
```

In the corrected version, we have added a condition to check if `request.body` is already in bytes format. If it is not, we encode it using `to_bytes` before concatenating it to the raw HTTP representation. This ensures proper encoding and fixes the bug in the function.
