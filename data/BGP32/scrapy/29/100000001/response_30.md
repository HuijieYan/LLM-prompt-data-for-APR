There is a potential bug in the `request_httprepr` function where the `Host` header might not be correctly constructed due to an issue with the parsing of the URL. The bug arises from using `parsed.hostname` instead of `parsed.netloc` to obtain the host information. The `parsed.hostname` does not include the port information if present, which can lead to incorrect HTTP headers.

To fix this bug, we should replace `parsed.hostname` with `parsed.netloc` when constructing the `Host` header.

```python
def request_httprepr(request):
    """Return the raw HTTP representation (as bytes) of the given request.
    This is provided only for reference since it's not the actual stream of
    bytes that will be send when performing the request (that's controlled
    by Twisted).
    """
    parsed = urlparse_cached(request)
    path = urlunparse(('', '', parsed.path or '/', parsed.params, parsed.query, ''))
    s = to_bytes(request.method) + b" " + to_bytes(path) + b" HTTP/1.1\r\n"
    s += b"Host: " + to_bytes(parsed.netloc) + b"\r\n" # Fixed line
    if request.headers:
        s += request.headers.to_string() + b"\r\n"
    s += b"\r\n"
    s += request.body
    return s
``` 

By making this change, the bug in the function will be fixed, and the `Host` header will be correctly constructed using the `netloc` attribute of the parsed URL.
