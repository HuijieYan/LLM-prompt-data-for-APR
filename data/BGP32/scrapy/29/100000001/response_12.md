The buggy function `request_httprepr` is intended to return a raw HTTP representation (as bytes) of the given request. However, there are potential error locations within the function that need to be addressed:

1. The `urlparse_cached` function is being called with `request` as an argument, but it expects a URL string instead. This could lead to unexpected behavior or errors.
2. The `to_bytes` and `to_native_str` functions may not handle certain types of input correctly, leading to issues with encoding the input data as bytes.

To fix the bug in the `request_httprepr` function, we need to ensure that the correct input is provided to `urlparse_cached` and handle the encoding of input data correctly. Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def request_httprepr(request):
    """Return the raw HTTP representation (as bytes) of the given request.
    This is provided only for reference since it's not the actual stream of
    bytes that will be send when performing the request (that's controlled
    by Twisted).
    """
    parsed = urlparse_cached(request.url)  # Use request.url instead of request directly
    path = urlunparse(('', '', parsed.path or '/', parsed.params, parsed.query, ''))

    method_bytes = to_bytes(request.method) if request.method else b''
    path_bytes = to_bytes(path) if path else b''
    hostname_bytes = to_bytes(parsed.hostname) if parsed.hostname else b''

    headers_bytes = to_bytes(request.headers.to_string()) if request.headers else b''

    full_request_bytes = b"{} {} HTTP/1.1\r\n".format(method_bytes, path_bytes)
    full_request_bytes += b"Host: {}\r\n".format(hostname_bytes)
    full_request_bytes += headers_bytes + b"\r\n"
    full_request_bytes += b"\r\n" + request.body

    return full_request_bytes
```

In the corrected version:
- We use `request.url` instead of directly passing `request` to `urlparse_cached` to ensure the correct input data.
- We handle encoding of strings with explicit checks and conversions to bytes.
- Properly construct the full request bytes by concatenating different components.

By making these changes, the function should now work correctly and return the raw HTTP representation of the given request as bytes.
