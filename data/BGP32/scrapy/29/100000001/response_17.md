The bug in the function `request_httprepr` is caused by the incorrect usage of the `urlunparse` function. The `urlunparse` function takes a tuple of size 6 (scheme, netloc, path, params, query, fragment) and returns a URL string. In the buggy code, the arguments provided to `urlunparse` are incorrect, which results in an incorrect URL being generated.

To fix the bug:
- Correct the arguments passed to `urlunparse` by providing a tuple with the correct values for the scheme, netloc, path, params, query, and fragment.
- Ensure the correct formatting of the HTTP request line and headers.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def request_httprepr(request):
    """Return the raw HTTP representation (as bytes) of the given request.
    This is provided only for reference since it's not the actual stream of
    bytes that will be sent when performing the request (that's controlled
    by Twisted).
    """
    parsed = urlparse_cached(request)
    path = urlunparse(('', '', parsed.path, '', '', ''))
    s = to_bytes(request.method) + b" " + to_bytes(path) + b" HTTP/1.1\r\n"
    s += b"Host: " + to_bytes(parsed.hostname) + b"\r\n"
    if request.headers:
        s += request.headers.to_string() + b"\r\n"
    s += b"\r\n"
    s += request.body
    return s
``` 

In this corrected version, the `urlunparse` function is provided with the correct parameters in the tuple, ensuring the generation of a valid URL string. Additionally, the formatting of the HTTP request line and headers is adjusted to produce the correct raw HTTP representation.
