### Explanation:
The error message `TypeError: to_bytes must receive a unicode, str or bytes object, got NoneType` indicates that the `parsed.hostname` in the provided code is `None`, leading to an error when trying to concatenate it with `b"Host: "`.

### Bug:
The bug in the code occurs when the `parsed` result does not have a `hostname`, which can happen in cases like when the request URL scheme is not using the hostname.

### Fix:
We need to handle the situation where `parsed.hostname` is `None` by providing a default value for the `Host` header. If `parsed.hostname` is `None`, we can set it to an empty string.

### The corrected function:
```python
def request_httprepr(request):
    """Return the raw HTTP representation (as bytes) of the given request.
    This is provided only for reference since it's not the actual stream of
    bytes that will be sent when performing the request (that's controlled
    by Twisted).
    """
    parsed = urlparse_cached(request)
    path = urlunparse(('', '', parsed.path or '/', parsed.params, parsed.query, ''))
    
    host_header = b''
    if parsed.hostname:
        host_header = b"Host: " + to_bytes(parsed.hostname) + b"\r\n"
    
    s = to_bytes(request.method) + b" " + to_bytes(path) + b" HTTP/1.1\r\n"
    s += host_header
    if request.headers:
        s += request.headers.to_string() + b"\r\n"
    s += b"\r\n"
    s += request.body
    return s
``` 

By adding the check for `parsed.hostname` before constructing the `Host` header, we ensure that the corrected function can handle cases where the hostname is not available in the parsed result. This fix should address the bug and enable the function to handle non-HTTP URLs correctly.
