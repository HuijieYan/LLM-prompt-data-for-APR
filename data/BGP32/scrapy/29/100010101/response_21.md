### Bug Explanation
The error message `to_bytes must receive a unicode, str or bytes object, got NoneType` indicates that the `parsed.hostname` value is `None`, causing an error when trying to convert it to bytes using `to_bytes`.

This issue arises when the URL does not have a hostname specified, as is the case with non-HTTP URLs like `file:///tmp/foo.txt`.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix this bug, we need to handle the case where `parsed.hostname` is `None`. We can check if `parsed.hostname` exists and is not `None` before attempting to concatenate it to the `s` variable.

### The corrected version of the function

```python
def request_httprepr(request):
    """Return the raw HTTP representation (as bytes) of the given request.
    This is provided only for reference since it's not the actual stream of
    bytes that will be send when performing the request (that's controlled
    by Twisted).
    """
    parsed = urlparse_cached(request)
    path = urlunparse(('', '', parsed.path or '/', parsed.params, parsed.query, ''))
    s = to_bytes(request.method) + b" " + to_bytes(path) + b" HTTP/1.1\r\n"
    if parsed.hostname:  # Check if hostname exists
        s += b"Host: " + to_bytes(parsed.hostname) + b"\r\n"
    if request.headers:
        s += request.headers.to_string() + b"\r\n"
    s += b"\r\n"
    s += request.body
    return s
```

This corrected version of the function includes a check to ensure that `parsed.hostname` exists before appending it to the `s` variable. This change will prevent the error when `parsed.hostname` is `None`.
