The bug in the provided function `request_httprepr` is that it is trying to access `parsed.hostname` without considering the case where the `parsed` object might not have a `hostname` attribute, resulting in the TypeError indicated in the failing test.

To fix this bug, we need to handle the case where `parsed.hostname` might be `None`. We can address this by checking if `parsed.hostname` is not None before concatenating it in the `s` variable. If it is None, we can use an empty string instead.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
# The corrected version of the function
def request_httprepr(request):
    """Return the raw HTTP representation (as bytes) of the given request.
    This is provided only for reference since it's not the actual stream of
    bytes that will be send when performing the request (that's controlled
    by Twisted).
    """
    parsed = urlparse_cached(request)
    path = urlunparse(('', '', parsed.path or '/', parsed.params, parsed.query, ''))
    s = to_bytes(request.method) + b" " + to_bytes(path) + b" HTTP/1.1\r\n"
    if parsed.hostname is not None:
        s += b"Host: " + to_bytes(parsed.hostname) + b"\r\n"
    if request.headers:
        s += request.headers.to_string() + b"\r\n"
    s += b"\r\n"
    s += request.body
    return s
```

With this modification, the corrected function will handle the case where `parsed.hostname` might be `None`, preventing the TypeError. This corrected version should pass the failing test cases provided.
