The bug in the provided function `request_httprepr` is that it's trying to access `parsed.hostname` without considering the case when `parsed.hostname` might be `None`, which leads to the `TypeError` raised inside the `to_bytes` function.

### Cause of the Bug:
The bug occurs because the `urlparse_cached` function might return a `ParseResult` where `hostname` is `None`, but the function does not handle this case. When trying to concatenate `parsed.hostname` in the line `s += b"Host: " + to_bytes(parsed.hostname) + b"\r\n"`, it leads to a `TypeError` when trying to convert `None` to bytes.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to handle the case where `parsed.hostname` is `None` before trying to convert it to bytes. We can modify the code to check if `parsed.hostname` is `None` and replace it with an empty string before converting it to bytes.

### Corrected Version of the `request_httprepr` Function:
```python
def request_httprepr(request):
    """Return the raw HTTP representation (as bytes) of the given request.
    This is provided only for reference since it's not the actual stream of
    bytes that will be send when performing the request (that's controlled
    by Twisted).
    """
    parsed = urlparse_cached(request)
    path = urlunparse(('', '', parsed.path or '/', parsed.params, parsed.query, ''))
    s = to_bytes(request.method) + b" " + to_bytes(path) + b" HTTP/1.1\r\n"
    
    # Handle the case when parsed.hostname is None
    hostname = parsed.hostname if parsed.hostname else ''
    
    s += b"Host: " + to_bytes(hostname) + b"\r\n"
    if request.headers:
        s += request.headers.to_string() + b"\r\n"
    s += b"\r\n"
    s += request.body
    return s
```

By adding a check for `parsed.hostname` being `None` and replacing it with an empty string, we ensure that the function can handle cases where the hostname is not present. This updated version should now pass the failing test cases and satisfy the expected input/output values.
