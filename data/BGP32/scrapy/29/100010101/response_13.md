### Analyzing the buggy function and error message:

The `request_httprepr` function is designed to generate the raw HTTP representation of a given request. The error occurs when trying to access the `parsed.hostname` attribute for a non-HTTP request (in this case, a file request). The error message indicates that the `to_bytes` function is receiving a `NoneType` object for conversion. This happens because `parsed.hostname` is `None` in the case of a non-HTTP request, leading to the error.

### Fixing the bug:

To fix this bug, we need to handle the case where `parsed.hostname` is `None` due to a non-HTTP request. We can modify the function to accommodate this by checking if `parsed.hostname` is not `None` before trying to concatenate it with other strings.

### The corrected version of the function:

```python
def request_httprepr(request):
    """Return the raw HTTP representation (as bytes) of the given request.
    This is provided only for reference since it's not the actual stream of
    bytes that will be send when performing the request (that's controlled
    by Twisted).
    """
    parsed = urlparse_cached(request)
    path = urlunparse(('', '', parsed.path or '/', parsed.params, parsed.query, ''))
    s = to_bytes(request.method) + b" " + to_bytes(path) + b" HTTP/1.1\r\n"

    if parsed.hostname is not None:
        s += b"Host: " + to_bytes(parsed.hostname) + b"\r\n"

    if request.headers:
        s += request.headers.to_string() + b"\r\n"
    s += b"\r\n"
    s += request.body
    return s
```

With this modification, we check if `parsed.hostname` is not `None` before appending it to the string to avoid the `NoneType` error. This fix should now handle non-HTTP requests gracefully and generate the correct raw HTTP representation.
