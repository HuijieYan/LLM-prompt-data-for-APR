## Analysis
The error message indicates a `TypeError` occurring in the `to_bytes` function due to receiving a `NoneType` instead of the expected `str`, `unicode`, or `bytes` object. This error happens when trying to concatenate `b"Host: "` with `to_bytes(parsed.hostname)`.

The bug stems from the fact that when parsing an URL with a file scheme (`file://`), the `hostname` attribute is `None`, which causes the `TypeError` when trying to convert it into bytes.

## Bug Fix Strategy
To fix this bug, we need to handle the case where the `hostname` attribute is `None` separately in the `request_httprepr` function. If the `hostname` is `None`, we should provide an alternative value to prevent the `TypeError`.

## The corrected version of the function
```python
def request_httprepr(request):
    """Return the raw HTTP representation (as bytes) of the given request.
    This is provided only for reference since it's not the actual stream of
    bytes that will be send when performing the request (that's controlled
    by Twisted).
    """
    parsed = urlparse_cached(request)
    path = urlunparse(('', '', parsed.path or '/', parsed.params, parsed.query, ''))
    s = to_bytes(request.method) + b" " + to_bytes(path) + b" HTTP/1.1\r\n"
    s += b"Host: " + to_bytes(parsed.hostname) if parsed.hostname else b"localhost" + b"\r\n"  # handle None hostname
    if request.headers:
        s += request.headers.to_string() + b"\r\n"
    s += b"\r\n"
    s += request.body
    return s
```

By adding a conditional statement to handle the case where `parsed.hostname` is `None`, we ensure that the `TypeError` is prevented. Now the function should correctly handle URL parsing errors with file schemes and provide the expected HTTP representation output for non-HTTP requests.
