The bug in the `request_httprepr` function is causing a `TypeError` due to the `parsed.hostname` being `None`. This happens when the `parsed` object does not have a `hostname` attribute, which is the case for non-HTTP requests like `file:///tmp/foo.txt`.

To fix this issue, we need to handle the case where `parsed.hostname` may be `None`. We can check if `parsed.hostname` is not `None` before concatenating it with other bytes.

Here is the corrected version of the `request_httprepr` function:

```python
def request_httprepr(request):
    """Return the raw HTTP representation (as bytes) of the given request.
    This is provided only for reference since it's not the actual stream of
    bytes that will be sent when performing the request (that's controlled
    by Twisted).
    """
    parsed = urlparse_cached(request)
    path = urlunparse(('', '', parsed.path or '/', parsed.params, parsed.query, ''))
    s = to_bytes(request.method) + b" " + to_bytes(path) + b" HTTP/1.1\r\n"
    
    if parsed.hostname is not None:
        s += b"Host: " + to_bytes(parsed.hostname) + b"\r\n"
    
    if request.headers:
        s += request.headers.to_string() + b"\r\n"
    
    s += b"\r\n"
    s += request.body
    return s
```

Now, the corrected function should handle cases where `parsed` does not have a `hostname` attribute, preventing the `TypeError` from occurring. The function should pass the failing test cases and return the expected values as described.
