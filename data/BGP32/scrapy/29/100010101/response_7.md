### Analysis
The error message indicates a `TypeError` in the `to_bytes` function with a `NoneType` value. This error occurs when `parsed.hostname` is `None`, causing `to_bytes` to receive a `NoneType` value when it expects a string. The issue arises because the `parsed` object does not always have a `hostname` attribute, especially for non-HTTP requests like the `file:///tmp/foo.txt` request in the failing test.

### Bug Fix Strategy
We need to handle the case where `parsed.hostname` is `None` by providing a fallback value. This can be achieved by using the `netloc` attribute of the parsed URL if `hostname` is not present.

### The corrected version of the function
```python
def request_httprepr(request):
    """Return the raw HTTP representation (as bytes) of the given request.
    This is provided only for reference since it's not the actual stream of
    bytes that will be send when performing the request (that's controlled
    by Twisted).
    """
    parsed = urlparse_cached(request)
    path = urlunparse(('', '', parsed.path or '/', parsed.params, parsed.query, ''))
    hostname = parsed.hostname if parsed.hostname else parsed.netloc
    s = to_bytes(request.method) + b" " + to_bytes(path) + b" HTTP/1.1\r\n"
    s += b"Host: " + to_bytes(hostname) + b"\r\n"
    if request.headers:
        s += request.headers.to_string() + b"\r\n"
    s += b"\r\n"
    s += request.body
    return s
```

By using the `hostname` attribute if present, and falling back to using the `netloc` attribute, we can handle cases where `parsed.hostname` is `None`. This correction should resolve the `TypeError` and ensure the function works as expected for non-HTTP requests.
