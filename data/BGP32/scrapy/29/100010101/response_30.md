### Analysis
The error occurs when trying to concatenate the hostname in the HTTP representation of the request. The bug is caused by the `None` value in the `parsed.hostname` variable, which is not handled correctly.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to handle the case when `parsed.hostname` is `None` and provide a default value or behavior.

### The corrected version of the function
```python
def request_httprepr(request):
    """Return the raw HTTP representation (as bytes) of the given request.
    This is provided only for reference since it's not the actual stream of
    bytes that will be send when performing the request (that's controlled
    by Twisted).
    """
    parsed = urlparse_cached(request)
    path = urlunparse(('', '', parsed.path or '/', parsed.params, parsed.query, ''))
    host = b"Host: " + to_bytes(parsed.hostname) + b"\r\n" if parsed.hostname else b""
    s = to_bytes(request.method) + b" " + to_bytes(path) + b" HTTP/1.1\r\n"
    s += host
    if request.headers:
        s += request.headers.to_string() + b"\r\n"
    s += b"\r\n"
    s += request.body
    return s
```

Now, the corrected function explicitly handles the case when `parsed.hostname` is `None` by providing an empty value for the Host header. This should fix the bug and pass the failing test cases.
