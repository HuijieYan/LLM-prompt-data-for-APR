The bug in the `request_httprepr` function is caused by `parsed.hostname` being None when the scheme of the URL is not 'http' or 'https'. This leads to a TypeError when trying to convert it to bytes using the `to_bytes` function.

To fix this issue, we need to handle the case where `parsed.hostname` is None differently. We can check if `parsed.hostname` is None and provide a default value in such cases.

Here is the corrected version of the `request_httprepr` function:

```python
def request_httprepr(request):
    """Return the raw HTTP representation (as bytes) of the given request.
    This is provided only for reference since it's not the actual stream of
    bytes that will be sent when performing the request (that's controlled
    by Twisted).
    """
    parsed = urlparse_cached(request)
    path = urlunparse(('', '', parsed.path or '/', parsed.params, parsed.query, ''))
    s = to_bytes(request.method) + b" " + to_bytes(path) + b" HTTP/1.1\r\n"
    if parsed.hostname is not None:  # Check if parsed.hostname is not None
        s += b"Host: " + to_bytes(parsed.hostname) + b"\r\n"
    if request.headers:
        s += request.headers.to_string() + b"\r\n"
    s += b"\r\n"
    s += request.body
    return s
```

With this correction, the function now handles cases where `parsed.hostname` is None. This should resolve the TypeError mentioned in the failing test, and the function should now pass the test cases provided.

The corrected function ensures that the `parsed.hostname` value is checked before converting it to bytes, preventing any potential errors.
