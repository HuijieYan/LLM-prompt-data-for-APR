### Analysis:
The error message indicates that the `parsed.hostname` is `None`, causing the `to_bytes` function to raise a `TypeError`. This occurs when the URL is of a different scheme (like `file://` instead of `http://` or `https://`). The function assumes that `hostname` will always be parsed correctly for any URL, leading to the bug.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to handle the case where `parsed.hostname` is `None` gracefully, particularly for non-HTTP URLs. We can modify the code to check the scheme of the URL and handle it accordingly.

### Corrected Function:
```python
def request_httprepr(request):
    """Return the raw HTTP representation (as bytes) of the given request.
    This is provided only for reference since it's not the actual stream of
    bytes that will be send when performing the request (that's controlled
    by Twisted).
    """
    parsed = urlparse_cached(request)
    path = urlunparse(('', '', parsed.path or '/', parsed.params, parsed.query, ''))
    s = to_bytes(request.method) + b" " + to_bytes(path) + b" HTTP/1.1\r\n"
    
    if parsed.scheme in ['http', 'https']:
        s += b"Host: " + to_bytes(parsed.hostname) + b"\r\n"
    
    if request.headers:
        s += request.headers.to_string() + b"\r\n"
    
    s += b"\r\n"
    s += request.body
    return s
```

By checking if the scheme is `http` or `https`, we ensure that we only append the `Host` header when it's relevant. This fix will prevent the `TypeError` when dealing with non-HTTP URLs.
