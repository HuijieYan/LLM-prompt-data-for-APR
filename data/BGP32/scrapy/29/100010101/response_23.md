### Analysis
The error occurs because the `parsed.hostname` is `None` when the scheme in the URL is not 'http' or 'https', resulting in a `TypeError` when trying to convert it to bytes in the line `s += b"Host: " + to_bytes(parsed.hostname) + b"\r\n"`.

### Bug Cause
1. When the URL scheme is not 'http' or 'https', the hostname in the parsed result is set to `None`.
2. Trying to convert `None` to bytes using `to_bytes()` results in a `TypeError`.

### Fix Strategy
To fix this bug, we need to handle the case where the hostname is `None` by providing a default value or handling it differently.

### The corrected version of the function
```python
def request_httprepr(request):
    """Return the raw HTTP representation (as bytes) of the given request.
    This is provided only for reference since it's not the actual stream of
    bytes that will be send when performing the request (that's controlled
    by Twisted).
    """
    parsed = urlparse_cached(request)
    path = urlunparse(('', '', parsed.path or '/', parsed.params, parsed.query, ''))
    s = to_bytes(request.method) + b" " + to_bytes(path) + b" HTTP/1.1\r\n"
    
    # Handling the case when hostname is None
    hostname = parsed.hostname if parsed.hostname else b''
    s += b"Host: " + to_bytes(hostname) + b"\r\n"
    
    if request.headers:
        s += request.headers.to_string() + b"\r\n"
    s += b"\r\n"
    s += request.body
    return s
```

By adding a conditional check to assign an empty bytes object to `hostname` if `parsed.hostname` is `None`, we ensure that the TypeError is avoided when converting it to bytes. This will fix the bug and make the function handle non-HTTP URLs correctly.
