### Analyzing the buggy function and error message
The buggy function `request_httprepr` is intended to return the raw HTTP representation (as bytes) of a given request. The error message indicates a `TypeError` within the `to_bytes` function, specifically when trying to concatenate the hostname. The error occurs because `parsed.hostname` is `None` in cases where the request's URL does not include a hostname.

### Identifying potential error locations
1. The usage of `parsed.hostname` without handling cases where it might be `None`.
2. Improper handling of URL components that do not include a hostname.

### Explaining the cause of the bug
The bug occurs because the code assumes that the `hostname` attribute of the parsed URL is always present. When the URL does not contain a hostname, `parsed.hostname` is `None`, leading to a `NoneType` error when attempting to concatenate it in the `to_bytes` function.

### Suggesting a strategy for fixing the bug
To fix the bug, we need to handle the case where `parsed.hostname` is `None` and provide a default behavior for URLs without a hostname. We can modify the code to check if `parsed.hostname` is `None` and handle this scenario appropriately.

### Corrected version of the function
Here is the corrected version of the `request_httprepr` function:

```python
def request_httprepr(request):
    parsed = urlparse_cached(request)
    path = urlunparse(('', '', parsed.path or '/', parsed.params, parsed.query, ''))
    
    host_header = b"Host: " + to_bytes(parsed.hostname) + b"\r\n" if parsed.hostname else b"Host: \r\n"
    
    s = to_bytes(request.method) + b" " + to_bytes(path) + b" HTTP/1.1\r\n"
    s += host_header
    if request.headers:
        s += request.headers.to_string() + b"\r\n"
    s += b"\r\n"
    s += request.body
    return s
```

This corrected version includes a conditional check for `parsed.hostname` to handle cases where it is `None`. It provides a default behavior for constructing the `Host` header in the HTTP representation. This modification ensures that the function can handle URLs without a hostname properly.
