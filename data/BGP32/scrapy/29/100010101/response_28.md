The bug in the provided function `request_httprepr` is that the `parsed.hostname` variable is sometimes `None`, which causes the `to_bytes` function to raise a `TypeError` when trying to convert it to bytes.

To fix this bug, we can check if `parsed.hostname` is `None` before trying to concatenate it to the byte string. If it is `None`, we can set it to an empty string `''` instead.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def request_httprepr(request):
    """Return the raw HTTP representation (as bytes) of the given request.
    This is provided only for reference since it's not the actual stream of
    bytes that will be send when performing the request (that's controlled
    by Twisted).
    """
    parsed = urlparse_cached(request)
    path = urlunparse(('', '', parsed.path or '/', parsed.params, parsed.query, ''))
    
    # Check if parsed.hostname is None
    if parsed.hostname is None:
        hostname = b''
    else:
        hostname = to_bytes(parsed.hostname)
    
    s = to_bytes(request.method) + b" " + to_bytes(path) + b" HTTP/1.1\r\n"
    s += b"Host: " + hostname + b"\r\n"
    if request.headers:
        s += request.headers.to_string() + b"\r\n"
    s += b"\r\n"
    s += request.body
    return s
```

With this correction, the function should now be able to handle cases where `parsed.hostname` is `None`.

This corrected version should pass the failing test and satisfy the expected input/output values provided.
