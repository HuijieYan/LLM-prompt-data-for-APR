### Analysis
The error message indicates that the `parsed.hostname` is returning `None`, which causes an issue when trying to concatenate it with other bytes objects in the `request_httprepr` function. This is occurring because the `hostname` attribute of the parsed URL is not set for non-http URLs like `file://`.

### Fix
To fix this issue, we can modify the code to handle cases where `parsed.hostname` might be `None`. In such cases, we can omit the "Host" header in the raw HTTP representation.

### Corrected Version
```python
from six.moves.urllib.parse import urlunparse
from scrapy.utils.python import to_bytes
from scrapy.utils.httpobj import urlparse_cached

def request_httprepr(request):
    """Return the raw HTTP representation (as bytes) of the given request.
    This is provided only for reference since it's not the actual stream of
    bytes that will be sent when performing the request (that's controlled
    by Twisted).
    """
    parsed = urlparse_cached(request)
    path = urlunparse(('', '', parsed.path or '/', parsed.params, parsed.query, ''))
    s = to_bytes(request.method) + b" " + to_bytes(path) + b" HTTP/1.1\r\n"
    if parsed.hostname:
        s += b"Host: " + to_bytes(parsed.hostname) + b"\r\n"
    if request.headers:
        s += request.headers.to_string() + b"\r\n"
    s += b"\r\n"
    s += request.body
    return s
```

Now the corrected function will handle cases where `parsed.hostname` might be `None`, ensuring a successful representation even for non-http URLs like in the failing test case.
