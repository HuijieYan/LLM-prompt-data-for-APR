The bug in the `request_httprepr` function is due to the `parsed.hostname` being `None` when the scheme is not `http` or `https`, resulting in a `TypeError` in the `to_bytes` function when trying to convert `None` to bytes. To fix this issue, we can check if `parsed.hostname` is not `None` before appending it to the byte string.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def request_httprepr(request):
    """Return the raw HTTP representation (as bytes) of the given request.
    This is provided only for reference since it's not the actual stream of
    bytes that will be send when performing the request (that's controlled
    by Twisted).
    """
    parsed = urlparse_cached(request)
    path = urlunparse(('', '', parsed.path or '/', parsed.params, parsed.query, ''))
    s = to_bytes(request.method) + b" " + to_bytes(path) + b" HTTP/1.1\r\n"
    
    if parsed.hostname is not None:
        s += b"Host: " + to_bytes(parsed.hostname) + b"\r\n"
    
    if request.headers:
        s += request.headers.to_string() + b"\r\n"
    s += b"\r\n"
    s += request.body
    return s
```

This corrected version adds a check to ensure that `parsed.hostname` is not `None` before appending it to the byte string. This will prevent the `TypeError` from occurring when trying to convert `None` to bytes.

The corrected function should now pass the failing test cases provided and return the expected values and types mentioned for each case.
