Based on the provided buggy function and the error message, the issue arises when trying to concatenate the "Host" header with the parsed hostname. The error message indicates that the `to_bytes` function is receiving a `NoneType` object for the `parsed.hostname`. This suggests that the `hostname` attribute of the `parsed` object is None, which causes the `to_bytes` function to raise a TypeError.

To fix this issue, we need to handle the case where `parsed.hostname` is None. We should check if `parsed.hostname` exists before concatenating it with the "Host" header.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def request_httprepr(request):
    """Return the raw HTTP representation (as bytes) of the given request.
    This is provided only for reference since it's not the actual stream of
    bytes that will be send when performing the request (that's controlled
    by Twisted).
    """
    parsed = urlparse_cached(request)
    path = urlunparse(('', '', parsed.path or '/', parsed.params, parsed.query, ''))
    s = to_bytes(request.method) + b" " + to_bytes(path) + b" HTTP/1.1\r\n"
    
    if parsed.hostname:
        s += b"Host: " + to_bytes(parsed.hostname) + b"\r\n"
    
    if request.headers:
        s += request.headers.to_string() + b"\r\n"
    s += b"\r\n"
    s += request.body
    return s
```

By including the check `if parsed.hostname:` before trying to concatenate it with the "Host" header, we ensure that the function won't raise an error if `parsed.hostname` is None.

This correction should pass the failing test case and provide the expected output values for both cases.
