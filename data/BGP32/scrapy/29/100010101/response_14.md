The bug in the function `request_httprepr()` is caused by trying to access the `hostname` attribute of the parsed URL without checking if it exists. This leads to a `NoneType` error when the URL scheme is not 'http' or 'https', as in the case of 'file' or 'ftp' schemes.

To fix this bug, we need to handle the case where `parsed.hostname` might be `None`. We can simply check if `parsed.hostname` is not `None` before trying to concatenate it with the `b"Host: "` bytes in the string concatenation.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def request_httprepr(request):
    """Return the raw HTTP representation (as bytes) of the given request.
    This is provided only for reference since it's not the actual stream of
    bytes that will be send when performing the request (that's controlled
    by Twisted).
    """
    parsed = urlparse_cached(request)
    path = urlunparse(('', '', parsed.path or '/', parsed.params, parsed.query, ''))
    s = to_bytes(request.method) + b" " + to_bytes(path) + b" HTTP/1.1\r\n"
    
    if parsed.hostname is not None:
        s += b"Host: " + to_bytes(parsed.hostname) + b"\r\n"
    
    if request.headers:
        s += request.headers.to_string() + b"\r\n"
    
    s += b"\r\n"
    s += request.body
    
    return s
```

With this modification, the function will now correctly handle cases where the parsed URL's `hostname` is `None`. It should now pass the failing test case and satisfy the expected input/output values for both 'file' and 'ftp' schemes.
