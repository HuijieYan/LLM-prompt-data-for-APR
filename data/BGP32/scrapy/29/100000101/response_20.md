The bug in the provided function is in the line where the `Host` header is constructed. The hostname retrieval is incorrect, leading to an empty `Host` header when the parsed URL does not contain a hostname.

To fix this issue, we need to update the way the `parsed.hostname` is retrieved. We should check if the `netloc` of the parsed URL is not empty, then use it as the hostname. If the `netloc` is empty, we should fallback to using the `hostname` from the parsed URL.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def request_httprepr(request):
    """Return the raw HTTP representation (as bytes) of the given request.
    This is provided only for reference since it's not the actual stream of
    bytes that will be send when performing the request (that's controlled
    by Twisted).
    """
    parsed = urlparse_cached(request)
    path = urlunparse(('', '', parsed.path or '/', parsed.params, parsed.query, ''))
    hostname = parsed.netloc if parsed.netloc else parsed.hostname
    s = to_bytes(request.method) + b" " + to_bytes(path) + b" HTTP/1.1\r\n"
    s += b"Host: " + to_bytes(hostname) + b"\r\n"
    if request.headers:
        s += request.headers.to_string() + b"\r\n"
    s += b"\r\n"
    s += request.body
    return s
```

This corrected version will now construct the `Host` header correctly based on whether there is a `netloc` in the parsed URL, avoiding the issue of having an empty `Host` header.
