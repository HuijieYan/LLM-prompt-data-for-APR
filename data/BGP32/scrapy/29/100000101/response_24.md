The bug in the provided function is that it incorrectly constructs the path in the HTTP request representation, which leads to incorrect output values.

The issue is in the line:
```python
path = urlunparse(('', '', parsed.path or '/', parsed.params, parsed.query, ''))
```

The bug arises from the usage of `parsed.path or '/'`. In cases where `parsed.path` is an empty string, the `or` operator causes the default `'/'` to be used, irrespective of the actual path. This results in a wrong path being constructed in the HTTP representation.

To fix the bug, we should construct the path using only the non-empty `parsed.path`, rather than erroneously defaulting to `'/'`.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def request_httprepr(request):
    """Return the raw HTTP representation (as bytes) of the given request.
    This is provided only for reference since it's not the actual stream of
    bytes that will be send when performing the request (that's controlled
    by Twisted).
    """
    parsed = urlparse_cached(request)
    path = urlunparse(('', '', parsed.path, parsed.params, parsed.query, ''))
    s = to_bytes(request.method) + b" " + to_bytes(path) + b" HTTP/1.1\r\n"
    s += b"Host: " + to_bytes(parsed.hostname) + b"\r\n"
    if request.headers:
        s += request.headers.to_string() + b"\r\n"
    s += b"\r\n"
    s += request.body
    return s
```

This corrected version ensures that the path is correctly constructed as per the parsed URL components, instead of defaulting to `'/'`.
