The bug in the provided function is caused by the incorrect construction of the path variable using the urlparse_cached function. The bug fails to include the hostname in the "Host" header when parsing certain URLs.

To fix the bug, we need to update the construction of the path variable to include the hostname in the Host header. We should check if the parsed URL includes a hostname and use it appropriately.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def request_httprepr(request):
    parsed = urlparse_cached(request)
    path = urlunparse(('', '') + parsed[2:])
    s = to_bytes(request.method) + b" " + to_bytes(path) + b" HTTP/1.1\r\n"
    if parsed.hostname:
        s += b"Host: " + to_bytes(parsed.hostname) + b"\r\n"
    if request.headers:
        s += request.headers.to_string() + b"\r\n"
    s += b"\r\n"
    s += request.body
    return s
```

This corrected version checks if there is a hostname in the parsed URL and includes it in the Host header when constructing the raw HTTP representation. It satisfies the expected input/output values for both cases provided earlier.
