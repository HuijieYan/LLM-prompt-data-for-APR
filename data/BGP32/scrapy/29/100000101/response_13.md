The bug in the function `request_httprepr` lies in the construction of the `Host` header when the `parsed.hostname` is empty. In the provided code, the `Host` header is added even if `parsed.hostname` is empty, which is not correct.

To fix the bug, an if condition should be added to check if `parsed.hostname` is not empty before adding the `Host` header to the `s` variable.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def request_httprepr(request):
    """Return the raw HTTP representation (as bytes) of the given request.
    This is provided only for reference since it's not the actual stream of
    bytes that will be sent when performing the request (that's controlled by Twisted).
    """
    parsed = urlparse_cached(request)
    path = urlunparse(('', '', parsed.path or '/', parsed.params, parsed.query, ''))
    s = to_bytes(request.method) + b" " + to_bytes(path) + b" HTTP/1.1\r\n"
    
    if parsed.hostname:
        s += b"Host: " + to_bytes(parsed.hostname) + b"\r\n"

    if request.headers:
        s += request.headers.to_string() + b"\r\n"
    
    s += b"\r\n"
    s += request.body
    return s
```

Now, with the provided fix, the function should correctly handle cases where `parsed.hostname` is empty. The corrected function includes a conditional check to only add the `Host` header if `parsed.hostname` is not empty.

The corrected function should now satisfy both expected cases provided.
