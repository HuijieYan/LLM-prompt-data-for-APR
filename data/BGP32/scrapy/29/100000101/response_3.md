### Analysis
The buggy function `request_httprepr` is supposed to generate the raw HTTP representation of a given request object. The function uses the `urlparse_cached` function to parse the request URL and then constructs the necessary HTTP representation using other information from the request object.

The bug in the function is related to the `parsed.hostname` being used in the `Host` header construction. This creates an issue when the `parsed.hostname` is empty (as in the case of the `file` scheme), resulting in an empty `Host` header.

### Bug
The bug occurs when the request URL has no hostname (like in the case of the `file` scheme), which results in an empty `parsed.hostname` and consequently an empty `Host` header in the raw HTTP representation.

### Fix Strategy
To fix this bug, we need to handle the case when the `parsed.hostname` is empty, and adjust the `Host` header accordingly.

### Corrected Function
```python
def request_httprepr(request):
    parsed = urlparse_cached(request)
    path = urlunparse(('', '', parsed.path or '/', parsed.params, parsed.query, ''))
    s = to_bytes(request.method) + b" " + to_bytes(path) + b" HTTP/1.1\r\n"
    if parsed.hostname:
        host_header = b"Host: " + to_bytes(parsed.hostname) + b"\r\n"
        s += host_header
    if request.headers:
        s += request.headers.to_string() + b"\r\n"
    s += b"\r\n"
    s += request.body
    return s
```

By checking if `parsed.hostname` is not empty, we ensure that the `Host` header will only be included when there is a valid hostname present in the URL. This corrected version of the function should now handle cases where the hostname is empty appropriately.
