The bug in the provided function `request_httprepr` is that when constructing the raw HTTP representation `s`, the hostname is not being correctly extracted from the parsed URL. This results in the `Host` header not being populated as expected.

To fix this bug, we need to extract the `hostname` from the parsed URL and include it in the `Host` header line.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def request_httprepr(request):
    parsed = urlparse_cached(request)
    path = urlunparse(('', '', parsed.path or '/', parsed.params, parsed.query, ''))
    s = to_bytes(request.method) + b" " + to_bytes(path) + b" HTTP/1.1\r\n"
    
    # Extract the hostname from the parsed URL
    hostname = parsed.hostname
    
    s += b"Host: " + to_bytes(hostname) + b"\r\n"
    
    if request.headers:
        s += request.headers.to_string() + b"\r\n"
    
    s += b"\r\n"
    s += request.body
    return s
```

With this correction, the function will correctly include the `Host` header line with the extracted hostname from the parsed URL.

The updated function should now satisfy the expected input/output values for both provided cases.
