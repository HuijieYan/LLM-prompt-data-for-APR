The buggy function has an issue related to constructing the 'Host' header in the HTTP request. The problem arises from accessing `parsed.hostname` directly when `parsed.netloc` should be used instead.

To fix the bug, we need to replace `parsed.hostname` with `parsed.netloc` while constructing the 'Host' header. 

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def request_httprepr(request):
    """Return the raw HTTP representation (as bytes) of the given request.
    This is provided only for reference since it's not the actual stream of
    bytes that will be send when performing the request (that's controlled
    by Twisted).
    """
    parsed = urlparse_cached(request)
    path = urlunparse(('', '', parsed.path or '/', parsed.params, parsed.query, ''))
    s = to_bytes(request.method) + b" " + to_bytes(path) + b" HTTP/1.1\r\n"
    s += b"Host: " + to_bytes(parsed.netloc) + b"\r\n" # Replace parsed.hostname with parsed.netloc
    if request.headers:
        s += request.headers.to_string() + b"\r\n"
    s += b"\r\n"
    s += request.body
    return s
```

This corrected version ensures that the 'Host' header is constructed correctly by using `parsed.netloc` to access the hostname and port information.
