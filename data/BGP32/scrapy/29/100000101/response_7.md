The bug in the provided function `request_httprepr` is that it does not correctly handle the case where the parsed URL does not contain a hostname. This results in an empty `parsed.hostname`, causing issues when constructing the raw HTTP representation.

To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the `Host` header is correctly constructed even when the hostname is not present in the parsed URL.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def request_httprepr(request):
    parsed = urlparse_cached(request)
    host_header = b""
    if parsed.hostname:
        host_header = b"Host: " + to_bytes(parsed.hostname) + b"\r\n"
    
    path = urlunparse(('', '', parsed.path or '/', parsed.params, parsed.query, ''))
    s = to_bytes(request.method) + b" " + to_bytes(path) + b" HTTP/1.1\r\n"
    s += host_header
    if request.headers:
        s += request.headers.to_string() + b"\r\n"
    s += b"\r\n"
    s += request.body
    return s
```

This corrected version ensures that the `Host` header is only added to the raw HTTP representation if the hostname is present in the parsed URL. By doing this, we prevent the issue of having an empty `parsed.hostname` causing problems in constructing the raw HTTP representation.

This corrected version should now handle both cases provided in the expected values, producing the correct raw HTTP representation for the given requests.
