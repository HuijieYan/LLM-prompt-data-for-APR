The buggy function has an issue when handling the `parsed.hostname` attribute. It attempts to access this attribute directly from the `ParseResult` object, but it does not exist in the `ParseResult` attributes. The correct attribute to extract the hostname is `parsed.netloc`.

To fix the bug, we need to replace `parsed.hostname` with `parsed.netloc` when constructing the raw HTTP request.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def request_httprepr(request):
    """
    Return the raw HTTP representation (as bytes) of the given request.
    This is provided only for reference since it's not the actual stream of
    bytes that will be sent when performing the request (that's controlled by Twisted).
    """
    parsed = urlparse_cached(request)
    path = urlunparse(('', '', parsed.path or '/', parsed.params, parsed.query, ''))
    netloc = parsed.netloc if parsed.netloc else parsed.hostname
    s = to_bytes(request.method) + b" " + to_bytes(path) + b" HTTP/1.1\r\n"
    s += b"Host: " + to_bytes(netloc) + b"\r\n"
    if request.headers:
        s += request.headers.to_string() + b"\r\n"
    s += b"\r\n"
    s += request.body
    return s
```

This corrected version addresses the issue by using `parsed.netloc` to extract the hostname correctly. Now the function should return the expected results as described in the provided test cases.
