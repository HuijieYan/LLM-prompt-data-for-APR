The bug in the provided function is that it does not properly handle the hostname when generating the HTTP representation. As a result, the "Host" field is left empty if the parsed URL does not contain a hostname. To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the "Host" field is correctly populated with the hostname if one exists.

By analyzing the expected values and types of variables in the failing test cases, we can see that the bug occurs when the parsed URL does not have a hostname specified. In such cases, the "Host" field should be set to the netloc value from the parsed URL.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def request_httprepr(request):
    parsed = urlparse_cached(request)
    path = urlunparse(('', '', parsed.path or '/', parsed.params, parsed.query, ''))
    
    host = parsed.hostname if parsed.hostname else parsed.netloc
    s = to_bytes(request.method) + b" " + to_bytes(path) + b" HTTP/1.1\r\n"
    s += b"Host: " + to_bytes(host) + b"\r\n"
    
    if request.headers:
        s += request.headers.to_string() + b"\r\n"
        
    s += b"\r\n"
    s += request.body
    return s
```

This corrected version ensures that the "Host" field is populated with the hostname if it exists, otherwise, it uses the netloc value. This fix should satisfy the expected input/output values provided for the failing test cases.
