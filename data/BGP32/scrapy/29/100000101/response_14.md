The bug in the provided function is that the "parsed.hostname" variable is used directly to construct the "Host" header, which may not always be correct as the hostname could be different from the netloc. To fix this bug, we need to use the "parsed.netloc" instead.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def request_httprepr(request):
    """Return the raw HTTP representation (as bytes) of the given request.
    This is provided only for reference since it's not the actual stream of
    bytes that will be sent when performing the request (that's controlled
    by Twisted).
    """
    parsed = urlparse_cached(request)
    path = urlunparse(('', '', parsed.path or '/', parsed.params, parsed.query, ''))
    s = to_bytes(request.method) + b" " + to_bytes(path) + b" HTTP/1.1\r\n"
    s += b"Host: " + to_bytes(parsed.netloc) + b"\r\n"  # Using parsed.netloc instead of parsed.hostname
    if request.headers:
        s += request.headers.to_string() + b"\r\n"
    s += b"\r\n"
    s += request.body
    return s
```

With this correction, the function now correctly uses the netloc value to construct the "Host" header, ensuring that it is accurate. This change should fix the bug and satisfy the expected values for the provided cases.
