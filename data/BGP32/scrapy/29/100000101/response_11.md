The bug in the provided function `request_httprepr` is with the line where it constructs the `path` variable. The issue lies in not correctly handling the `parsed.path` when it is empty. In such cases, the function should default to `'/'` to ensure proper HTTP request formatting.

To fix this bug, we need to update the path construction logic. Below is the corrected version of the function:
```python
def request_httprepr(request):
    parsed = urlparse_cached(request)
    
    # Filter out the empty or None path
    path = parsed.path if parsed.path else '/'
    
    s = to_bytes(request.method) + b" " + to_bytes(path) + b" HTTP/1.1\r\n"
    s += b"Host: " + to_bytes(parsed.hostname) + b"\r\n"
    
    if request.headers:
        s += request.headers.to_string() + b"\r\n"
    
    s += b"\r\n"
    s += request.body
    
    return s
```

This corrected version ensures that even if `parsed.path` is empty, it defaults to `'/'`, resolving the issue identified in the function. This fix aligns with the expected input/output values provided for the two test cases.
