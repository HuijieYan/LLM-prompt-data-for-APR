The bug in the provided function is that it does not handle the case where the `parsed.hostname` is empty. This leads to the missing "Host" header in the generated HTTP request representation.

To fix this issue, we need to check if `parsed.hostname` is empty and handle this case accordingly by using a default value or skipping the "Host" header if it's not applicable.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def request_httprepr(request):
    """Return the raw HTTP representation (as bytes) of the given request.
    This is provided only for reference since it's not the actual stream of
    bytes that will be send when performing the request (that's controlled
    by Twisted).
    """
    parsed = urlparse_cached(request)
    path = urlunparse(('', '', parsed.path or '/', parsed.params, parsed.query, ''))
    s = to_bytes(request.method) + b" " + to_bytes(path) + b" HTTP/1.1\r\n"

    # Check if parsed.hostname is not empty before adding the Host header
    if parsed.hostname:
        s += b"Host: " + to_bytes(parsed.hostname) + b"\r\n"

    if request.headers:
        s += request.headers.to_string() + b"\r\n"
    s += b"\r\n"
    s += request.body
    return s
```

This corrected version includes a check for `parsed.hostname` before adding the "Host" header to the HTTP representation.

The function now satisfies both expected cases by handling the empty `parsed.hostname` case appropriately.
