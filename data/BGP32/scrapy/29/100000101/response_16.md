### Analysis
The buggy function `request_httprepr` takes a `Request` object as input and tries to create the raw HTTP representation as bytes. The bug seems to be related to the way the `path`, `hostname`, and headers are handled. 

The bug is in the line where the `hostname` is included in the HTTP request. It incorrectly retrieves `parsed.hostname` instead of checking `parsed.netloc`. This causes the bug in Case 1 where the hostname is empty.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to correct how the hostname is retrieved from the parsed URL. Instead of directly using `parsed.hostname`, we should check for the `parsed.netloc`, which includes both the hostname and port.

### Corrected Version
```python
def request_httprepr(request):
    """Return the raw HTTP representation (as bytes) of the given request.
    This is provided only for reference since it's not the actual stream of
    bytes that will be sent when performing the request (that's controlled
    by Twisted).
    """
    parsed = urlparse_cached(request)
    path = urlunparse(('', '', parsed.path or '/', parsed.params, parsed.query, ''))
    s = to_bytes(request.method) + b" " + to_bytes(path) + b" HTTP/1.1\r\n"
    
    # Fixing the bug related to hostname retrieval
    if parsed.netloc:
        host = parsed.netloc
    else:
        host = parsed.hostname

    s += b"Host: " + to_bytes(host) + b"\r\n"
    
    if request.headers:
        s += request.headers.to_string() + b"\r\n"
    s += b"\r\n"
    s += request.body
    return s
```

The corrected version ensures that the correct `host` (combining hostname and port if present) is used in the HTTP request header, addressing the bug.
