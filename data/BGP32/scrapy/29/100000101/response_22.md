The bug in the provided function occurs when constructing the `path` variable. The `urlunparse` function is used to construct the path, but it doesn't include the hostname, which can lead to issues in generating the correct HTTP representation.

To fix this bug, we need to modify how the `path` variable is constructed by including the hostname when appropriate. We can achieve this by checking if the scheme is `file` (which doesn't contain a hostname) and construct the path differently in that case.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def request_httprepr(request):
    parsed = urlparse_cached(request)
    if parsed.scheme == 'file':
        path = parsed.path
    else:
        path = urlunparse(('', '', parsed.path or '/', parsed.params, parsed.query, ''))
    s = to_bytes(request.method) + b" " + to_bytes(path) + b" HTTP/1.1\r\n"
    s += b"Host: " + to_bytes(parsed.hostname) + b"\r\n"
    if request.headers:
        s += request.headers.to_string() + b"\r\n"
    s += b"\r\n"
    s += request.body
    return s
```

This corrected version checks if the scheme is `file` and assigns `parsed.path` directly to `path`. Otherwise, it constructs the path using `urlunparse`. This modification ensures that the correct HTTP representation is generated for requests with different schemes.
