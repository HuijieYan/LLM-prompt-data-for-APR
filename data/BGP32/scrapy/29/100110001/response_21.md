## Analysis:
- The error message indicates a `TypeError` in the `to_bytes` function within the `request_httprepr` function in the `scrapy/utils/request.py` file.
- The error message specifically mentions that `to_bytes` received a `NoneType` object, causing the `TypeError`.
- The situation arises when trying to access the `hostname` attribute from the parsed URL.
- The failing test is attempting to generate the raw HTTP representation for non-HTTP requests, like URLs starting with `file://` and `ftp://`.

## Bug:
- The bug occurs when trying to access the `hostname` attribute in the `parsed` URL object without properly handling cases where `hostname` might be `None` for non-HTTP URLs.

## Fix:
- To fix the bug, we need to handle cases where `parsed.hostname` might be `None` due to non-HTTP URLs. We can check for `None` and provide a default value in those cases.

## Corrected Version:
```python
def request_httprepr(request):
    """Return the raw HTTP representation (as bytes) of the given request.
    This is provided only for reference since it's not the actual stream of
    bytes that will be send when performing the request (that's controlled
    by Twisted).
    """
    parsed = urlparse_cached(request)
    path = urlunparse(('', '', parsed.path or '/', parsed.params, parsed.query, ''))
    s = to_bytes(request.method) + b" " + to_bytes(path) + b" HTTP/1.1\r\n"
    
    # Check if parsed hostname is None
    hostname = parsed.hostname if parsed.hostname is not None else b"localhost"
    
    s += b"Host: " + to_bytes(hostname) + b"\r\n"
    
    if request.headers:
        s += request.headers.to_string() + b"\r\n"
    
    s += b"\r\n"
    s += request.body
    return s
```

By handling the case where `parsed.hostname` might be `None` and providing a default value like `localhost`, the corrected version should now handle non-HTTP URLs properly and pass the failing test.
