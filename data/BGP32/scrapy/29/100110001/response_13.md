### Analysis:
1. The error message indicates that the `to_bytes` function is being called with a `None` value for `parsed.hostname`.
2. The issue seems to be with how the `parsed` object is being handled from the `urlparse_cached` function. This function may return a `None` value for `hostname` if the parsed URL does not contain a hostname.
3. Since the `to_bytes` function expects a `unicode`, `str`, or `bytes` object, passing `None` causes a `TypeError`.
4. To fix this issue, we need to check if `parsed.hostname` is not `None` before concatenating it to the string in the `request_httprepr` function.

### Updated Corrected Version:
```python
def request_httprepr(request):
    """Return the raw HTTP representation (as bytes) of the given request.
    This is provided only for reference since it's not the actual stream of
    bytes that will be sent when performing the request (that's controlled
    by Twisted).
    """
    parsed = urlparse_cached(request)
    path = urlunparse(('', '', parsed.path or '/', parsed.params, parsed.query, ''))
    s = to_bytes(request.method) + b" " + to_bytes(path) + b" HTTP/1.1\r\n"
    
    if parsed.hostname is not None:  # Check if hostname is not None
        s += b"Host: " + to_bytes(parsed.hostname) + b"\r\n"
        
    if request.headers:
        s += request.headers.to_string() + b"\r\n"
    s += b"\r\n"
    s += request.body
    return s
```

By adding a check to ensure `parsed.hostname` is not `None` before using it with `to_bytes`, we can address the `TypeError` that was occurring in the original buggy function.
