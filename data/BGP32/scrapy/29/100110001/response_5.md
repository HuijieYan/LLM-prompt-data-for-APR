## Analysis:
1. The failing test is calling the `request_httprepr` function with a non-HTTP request, such as `file:///tmp/foo.txt` and `ftp://localhost/tmp/foo.txt`.
2. The error message indicates that the `to_bytes` function is receiving `NoneType` as input, causing a `TypeError`.
3. The cause of the bug is that the `parsed.hostname` in the provided URL is `None` for non-HTTP URLs.
4. To fix the bug, we need to handle the case where `parsed.hostname` is `None` and provide a default value or handle it accordingly.
5. We can modify the code to check if `parsed.hostname` is `None` and set a default value if it is, or skip appending the `Host` header for non-HTTP URLs.

## Corrected Version:
```python
from six.moves.urllib.parse import urlunparse
from scrapy.utils.python import to_bytes
from scrapy.utils.httpobj import urlparse_cached

def request_httprepr(request):
    """Return the raw HTTP representation (as bytes) of the given request.
    This is provided only for reference since it's not the actual stream of
    bytes that will be send when performing the request (that's controlled
    by Twisted).
    """
    parsed = urlparse_cached(request)
    path = urlunparse(('', '', parsed.path or '/', parsed.params, parsed.query, ''))
    s = to_bytes(request.method) + b" " + to_bytes(path) + b" HTTP/1.1\r\n"
    
    if parsed.hostname:  # Check if hostname is not None
        s += b"Host: " + to_bytes(parsed.hostname) + b"\r\n"
    
    if request.headers:
        s += request.headers.to_bytes() + b"\r\n"
    
    s += b"\r\n"
    s += request.body
    
    return s
```

With this modification, we check if `parsed.hostname` is not `None` before adding the `Host` header to the request. This should handle non-HTTP URLs correctly and prevent the `NoneType` error.
