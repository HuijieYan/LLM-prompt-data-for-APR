The bug in the `request_httprepr` function is caused by the fact that the `parsed.hostname` value is sometimes `None`, leading to a `NoneType` error when trying to convert it to bytes. This happens when the URL scheme is not `http` and `https`, like `file` or `ftp`.

To fix this bug, we can modify the function to handle cases where `parsed.hostname` is `None`. We can replace `parsed.hostname` with `parsed.netloc` which includes the hostname and port information when it's available, and if not, we fallback to an empty string.

Here is the corrected version of the `request_httprepr` function:

```python
def request_httprepr(request):
    """Return the raw HTTP representation (as bytes) of the given request.
    This is provided only for reference since it's not the actual stream of
    bytes that will be sent when performing the request (that's controlled
    by Twisted).
    """
    parsed = urlparse_cached(request)
    path = urlunparse(('', '', parsed.path or '/', parsed.params, parsed.query, ''))
    
    hostname = parsed.hostname if parsed.hostname else parsed.netloc.split(':')[0] if parsed.netloc else ''
    
    s = to_bytes(request.method) + b" " + to_bytes(path) + b" HTTP/1.1\r\n"
    s += b"Host: " + to_bytes(hostname) + b"\r\n"
    
    if request.headers:
        s += request.headers.to_string() + b"\r\n"
    
    s += b"\r\n"
    s += request.body
    
    return s
```

With this modification, the `parsed.hostname` is replaced by `hostname` which takes into account the cases where the `hostname` is `None`. This corrected version of the function should now handle URLs with different schemes (like `file` or `ftp`) without raising the `NoneType` error.
