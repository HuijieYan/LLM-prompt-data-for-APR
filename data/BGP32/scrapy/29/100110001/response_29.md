## Analysis:
The error occurs in the `request_httprepr` function, specifically when trying to concatenate the hostname with the bytes string. The error message indicates that the `parsed.hostname` is `None`, causing the `to_bytes` function to raise a `TypeError`.

## Bug:
The bug is caused when the `parsed.hostname` is `None`, leading to a TypeError when trying to convert it to bytes.

## Fix:
To fix the bug, we need to handle the case where `parsed.hostname` is `None` and provide a default value that can be converted to bytes.

## The corrected version of the function:
```python
def request_httprepr(request):
    """Return the raw HTTP representation (as bytes) of the given request.
    This is provided only for reference since it's not the actual stream of
    bytes that will be sent when performing the request (that's controlled
    by Twisted).
    """
    parsed = urlparse_cached(request)
    path = urlunparse(('', '', parsed.path or '/', parsed.params, parsed.query, ''))
    s = to_bytes(request.method) + b" " + to_bytes(path) + b" HTTP/1.1\r\n"
    if parsed.hostname:
        s += b"Host: " + to_bytes(parsed.hostname) + b"\r\n"
    if request.headers:
        s += request.headers.to_string() + b"\r\n"
    s += b"\r\n"
    s += request.body
    return s
```

By adding a conditional check for `parsed.hostname` before concatenating it with the bytes string, we ensure that only when `parsed.hostname` is not `None`, it will be converted to bytes and concatenated. This change should prevent the `TypeError` that was occurring in the buggy version of the function.
