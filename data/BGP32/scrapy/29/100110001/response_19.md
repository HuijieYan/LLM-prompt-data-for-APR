### Analysis:
1. The `request_httprepr` function is called with non-HTTP requests like "file" and "ftp" schemes, which are causing the error.
2. The error occurs at the line `s += b"Host: " + to_bytes(parsed.hostname) + b"\r\n"` where the `parsed.hostname` is `None`, causing the `to_bytes` function to fail.
3. The cause of the bug is that for non-HTTP schemes, the `parsed.hostname` can be `None`, but the `to_bytes` function expects a valid value to convert.
4. To fix this bug, we should handle the case of `None` hostname separately before converting it to bytes. We should only include the "Host" header if the hostname exists in the URL.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def request_httprepr(request):
    """Return the raw HTTP representation (as bytes) of the given request.
    This is provided only for reference since it's not the actual stream of
    bytes that will be send when performing the request (that's controlled
    by Twisted).
    """
    parsed = urlparse_cached(request)
    path = urlunparse(('', '', parsed.path or '/', parsed.params, parsed.query, ''))
    s = to_bytes(request.method) + b" " + to_bytes(path) + b" HTTP/1.1\r\n"
    
    if parsed.hostname:
        s += b"Host: " + to_bytes(parsed.hostname) + b"\r\n"
    
    if request.headers:
        s += request.headers.to_string() + b"\r\n"
    
    s += b"\r\n"
    
    if request.body:
        s += request.body
    
    return s
```

By checking if `parsed.hostname` exists before converting it to bytes, we avoid the `None` value error and ensure that the function handles non-HTTP requests gracefully.
