### Analysis:
1. The `request_httprepr` function is attempting to retrieve the `hostname` from the parsed URL, but the `parsed` object might not have a `hostname` attribute if the URL scheme is not HTTP or HTTPS.
2. The error message indicates a `NoneType` error when trying to convert the `hostname` to bytes.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is caused by trying to access the `hostname` attribute of the parsed URL without checking if it exists. This causes a `NoneType` error when the URL scheme is not HTTP or HTTPS.

### Bug Fix:
To fix the bug, we need to handle cases where the parsed URL does not contain a `hostname` attribute. We can modify the function to check if the URL scheme is HTTP or HTTPS before trying to access the `hostname`.

### Corrected Function:
```python
def request_httprepr(request):
    """Return the raw HTTP representation (as bytes) of the given request.
    This is provided only for reference since it's not the actual stream of
    bytes that will be send when performing the request (that's controlled
    by Twisted).
    """
    parsed = urlparse_cached(request)
    path = urlunparse(('', '', parsed.path or '/', parsed.params, parsed.query, ''))
    s = to_bytes(request.method) + b" " + to_bytes(path) + b" HTTP/1.1\r\n"
    
    if parsed.scheme in ['http', 'https']:
        s += b"Host: " + to_bytes(parsed.hostname) + b"\r\n"
    
    if request.headers:
        s += request.headers.to_string() + b"\r\n"
    s += b"\r\n"
    s += request.body
    return s
```

With the updated function, we first check if the URL scheme is HTTP or HTTPS before trying to access the `hostname`. This change should prevent the `NoneType` error when dealing with non-HTTP requests.
