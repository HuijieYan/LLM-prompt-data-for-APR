The bug in the `request_httprepr` function arises from the `parsed.hostname` attribute being `None` when the URL scheme is not HTTP or HTTPS. This causes an error when trying to convert `parsed.hostname` to bytes in the line `s += b"Host: " + to_bytes(parsed.hostname) + b"\r\n"`.

To fix this bug, we need to handle the case where `parsed.hostname` is `None` by providing a default value for the `Host` header. Since the URL scheme is not HTTP or HTTPS, we cannot extract the hostname from the parsed URL. Instead, we can set a default host value such as `localhost` in such cases.

Here is the corrected version of the `request_httprepr` function:

```python
def request_httprepr(request):
    """Return the raw HTTP representation (as bytes) of the given request.
    This is provided only for reference since it's not the actual stream of
    bytes that will be send when performing the request (that's controlled
    by Twisted).
    """
    parsed = urlparse_cached(request)
    path = urlunparse(('', '', parsed.path or '/', parsed.params, parsed.query, ''))
    s = to_bytes(request.method) + b" " + to_bytes(path) + b" HTTP/1.1\r\n"
    if parsed.hostname is not None:
        host_header = b"Host: " + to_bytes(parsed.hostname) + b"\r\n"
    else:
        host_header = b"Host: localhost\r\n"
    s += host_header
    if request.headers:
        s += request.headers.to_string() + b"\r\n"
    s += b"\r\n"
    s += request.body
    return s
```

With this modification, the `request_httprepr` function will now handle cases where the hostname is `None` in the parsed URL and provide a default value for the `Host` header. This corrected version should now pass the failing test without raising a `TypeError`.
