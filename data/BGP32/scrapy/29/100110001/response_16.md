The cause of the error in the `request_httprepr` function is that the `parsed.hostname` attribute can sometimes be `None` if the URL scheme is not HTTP. When trying to concatenate `None` with a byte string in the line `s += b"Host: " + to_bytes(parsed.hostname) + b"\r\n"`, it raises a `TypeError` because `to_bytes()` expects a string, not `None`.

To fix this bug, we need to handle the case where `parsed.hostname` is `None`. We can check if `parsed.hostname` is not `None` before trying to concatenate it with `b"Host: "`. If it is `None`, we can provide a default value for the host.

Here is the corrected version of the `request_httprepr` function:

```python
def request_httprepr(request):
    """Return the raw HTTP representation (as bytes) of the given request.
    This is provided only for reference since it's not the actual stream of
    bytes that will be send when performing the request (that's controlled
    by Twisted).
    """
    parsed = urlparse_cached(request)
    path = urlunparse(('', '', parsed.path or '/', parsed.params, parsed.query, ''))
    
    # Handle the case where parsed.hostname is None
    host = to_bytes(parsed.hostname) if parsed.hostname else b"localhost"
    
    s = to_bytes(request.method) + b" " + to_bytes(path) + b" HTTP/1.1\r\n"
    s += b"Host: " + host + b"\r\n"
    if request.headers:
        s += request.headers.to_string() + b"\r\n"
    s += b"\r\n"
    s += request.body
    return s
```

With this correction, we check if `parsed.hostname` is `None`. If it is `None`, we use a default value of `b"localhost"` for the host. This change should prevent the `TypeError` that was occurring in the failing test case.

After applying this fix, the `request_httprepr` function should now pass the failing test case.
