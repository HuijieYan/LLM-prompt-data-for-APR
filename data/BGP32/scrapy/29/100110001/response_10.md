The bug in the `request_httprepr` function is occurring when it tries to extract the hostname from the parsed URL. The issue arises because the `parsed.hostname` attribute might be `None` when dealing with non-HTTP URLs like `file://`, causing the `to_bytes` function to throw a `TypeError` as it is expecting a valid string to encode.

To fix this issue, we need to handle the case where `parsed.hostname` is `None` by providing a default value. We can modify the code to explicitly check if `parsed.hostname` is not `None` before encoding it to bytes.

Here is the corrected version of the `request_httprepr` function:

```python
def request_httprepr(request):
    """Return the raw HTTP representation (as bytes) of the given request.
    This is provided only for reference since it's not the actual stream of
    bytes that will be send when performing the request (that's controlled
    by Twisted).
    """
    parsed = urlparse_cached(request)
    
    # Check if parsed.hostname is not None before encoding
    hostname = to_bytes(parsed.hostname) if parsed.hostname is not None else b""
    
    path = urlunparse(('', '', parsed.path or '/', parsed.params, parsed.query, ''))
    s = to_bytes(request.method) + b" " + to_bytes(path) + b" HTTP/1.1\r\n"
    s += b"Host: " + hostname + b"\r\n"
    
    if request.headers:
        s += request.headers.to_string() + b"\r\n"
    
    s += b"\r\n"
    s += request.body
    return s
```

With this modification, the function will now handle non-HTTP URLs gracefully by assigning an empty byte string to `parsed.hostname` if it is `None`. This change should address the `TypeError` that was previously occurring.

After applying this fix, the `test_request_httprepr_for_non_http_request` test should pass without any errors.
