### Analysis:
1. The error occurs in the `request_httprepr` function when trying to concatenate the 'Host' header.
2. The error message indicates that the `parsed.hostname` is `None`, causing the `to_bytes` function to raise a `TypeError` because it received `None`.
3. The bug is caused by the fact that the provided URL (`file:///tmp/foo.txt`) does not have a hostname in its parsed representation, resulting in `parsed.hostname` being `None`.
4. To fix the bug, we need to handle the case where the URL does not have a hostname by providing a default value for the `Host` header in such cases.

### Fix:
```python
def request_httprepr(request):
    """Return the raw HTTP representation (as bytes) of the given request.
    This is provided only for reference since it's not the actual stream of
    bytes that will be send when performing the request (that's controlled
    by Twisted).
    """
    parsed = urlparse_cached(request)
    path = urlunparse(('', '', parsed.path or '/', parsed.params, parsed.query, ''))
    
    if parsed.hostname is None:  # Check if hostname is None
        host_header = b"Host: "  # Provide a default value for Host header
    else:
        host_header = b"Host: " + to_bytes(parsed.hostname) + b"\r\n"
    
    s = to_bytes(request.method) + b" " + to_bytes(path) + b" HTTP/1.1\r\n"
    s += host_header
    if request.headers:
        s += request.headers.to_string() + b"\r\n"
    s += b"\r\n"
    s += request.body
    return s
```

By providing a default value for the `Host` header in cases where the hostname is `None`, we can prevent the `TypeError` from occurring when concatenating the header.
