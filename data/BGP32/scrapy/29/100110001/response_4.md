The bug in the `request_httprepr` function is due to passing a `None` value to the `to_bytes` function when trying to extract the `hostname` from a non-HTTP URL. This causes a `TypeError` since the function expects a valid value for conversion.

To fix this bug, we need to check if the `parsed.hostname` is `None` before trying to convert it to bytes. If it is `None`, we can provide a default empty string value to avoid the `TypeError`.

Here is the corrected version of the `request_httprepr` function:

```python
def request_httprepr(request):
    """Return the raw HTTP representation (as bytes) of the given request.
    This is provided only for reference since it's not the actual stream of
    bytes that will be send when performing the request (that's controlled
    by Twisted).
    """
    parsed = urlparse_cached(request)
    path = urlunparse(('', '', parsed.path or '/', parsed.params, parsed.query, ''))
    s = to_bytes(request.method) + b" " + to_bytes(path) + b" HTTP/1.1\r\n"
    
    # Fixing the bug related to passing None value to to_bytes function
    host = to_bytes(parsed.hostname) if parsed.hostname else b""
    
    s += b"Host: " + host + b"\r\n"
    
    if request.headers:
        s += request.headers.to_string() + b"\r\n"
    
    s += b"\r\n"
    s += request.body
    return s
```

With this correction, the `request_httprepr` function should now handle non-HTTP URLs correctly and pass the failing test without raising a `TypeError`.
