## Analysis:
1. The `request_httprepr` function is parsing a non-HTTP request URL using `urlparse_cached`, which could lead to `parsed.hostname` being `None`.
2. The error message is due to `to_bytes` function receiving `parsed.hostname` as `None`, which results in a `NoneType` error.

## Bug Cause:
The bug is caused by `parsed.hostname` being `None`, which is not handled in the `request_httprepr` function when converting it to bytes using `to_bytes`.

## Bug Fix:
To fix the bug, we need to handle the case when `parsed.hostname` is `None` and adjust the conversion to bytes accordingly.

## Corrected Version of the function:
```python
def request_httprepr(request):
    """Return the raw HTTP representation (as bytes) of the given request.
    This is provided only for reference since it's not the actual stream of
    bytes that will be send when performing the request (that's controlled
    by Twisted).
    """
    parsed = urlparse_cached(request)
    path = urlunparse(('', '', parsed.path or '/', parsed.params, parsed.query, ''))
    s = to_bytes(request.method) + b" " + to_bytes(path) + b" HTTP/1.1\r\n"
    if parsed.hostname:
        s += b"Host: " + to_bytes(parsed.hostname) + b"\r\n"
    if request.headers:
        s += request.headers.to_string() + b"\r\n"
    s += b"\r\n"
    s += request.body
    return s
```

By adding a check for `parsed.hostname` before converting it to bytes, the corrected version avoids the `NoneType` error and handles non-HTTP request URLs gracefully.
