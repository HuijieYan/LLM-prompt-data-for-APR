## Analysis:
1. The `request_httprepr` function is trying to access the `hostname` attribute from the parsed URL, but for non-HTTP URLs like "file://" or "ftp://", the `parsed` object might not have a `hostname` attribute causing the `NoneType` error.
2. The error occurs in the line `s += b"Host: " + to_bytes(parsed.hostname) + b"\r\n"`.

## Bug Cause:
The bug is caused by trying to access the `hostname` attribute on a parsed URL object that may not have it (for non-HTTP URLs).

## Strategy for fixing the bug:
To fix the bug, we need to handle the case where the `hostname` attribute in the parsed URL object is `None`. We can modify the code to always concatenate an empty string if `parsed.hostname` is `None` before converting it to bytes.

## Corrected Version:
```python
from six.moves.urllib.parse import urlunparse
from scrapy.utils.python import to_bytes, to_native_str
from scrapy.utils.httpobj import urlparse_cached
from scrapy.http.request import Request

def request_httprepr(request):
    """Return the raw HTTP representation (as bytes) of the given request.
    This is provided only for reference since it's not the actual stream of
    bytes that will be send when performing the request (that's controlled
    by Twisted).
    """
    parsed = urlparse_cached(request)
    path = urlunparse(('', '', parsed.path or '/', parsed.params, parsed.query, ''))
    s = to_bytes(request.method) + b" " + to_bytes(path) + b" HTTP/1.1\r\n"
    
    if parsed.hostname is not None:
        s += b"Host: " + to_bytes(parsed.hostname) + b"\r\n"
    
    if request.headers:
        s += request.headers.to_string() + b"\r\n"
    
    s += b"\r\n"
    s += request.body
    return s
```

With this fix, the function now checks if the `hostname` attribute is not `None` before trying to concatenate it in the raw HTTP representation.
