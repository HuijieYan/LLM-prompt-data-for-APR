The bug in the `request_httprepr` function is related to passing a URL without a hostname, which causes the `parsed.hostname` to be `None`, leading to a `NoneType` error when trying to convert it to bytes.

To fix this bug, we should check if the `parsed.hostname` exists before adding it to the raw HTTP representation string.

Here is the corrected version of the `request_httprepr` function:

```python
def request_httprepr(request):
    """Return the raw HTTP representation (as bytes) of the given request.
    This is provided only for reference since it's not the actual stream of
    bytes that will be sent when performing the request (that's controlled
    by Twisted).
    """
    parsed = urlparse_cached(request)
    path = urlunparse(('', '', parsed.path or '/', parsed.params, parsed.query, ''))
    s = to_bytes(request.method) + b" " + to_bytes(path) + b" HTTP/1.1\r\n"
    
    if parsed.hostname:
        s += b"Host: " + to_bytes(parsed.hostname) + b"\r\n"
        
    if request.headers:
        s += request.headers.to_string() + b"\r\n"
    s += b"\r\n"
    s += request.body
    return s
```

With this modification, the function will check if the `parsed.hostname` exists before trying to add it to the raw HTTP representation string, preventing the `NoneType` error. This corrected version should now pass the failing test.
