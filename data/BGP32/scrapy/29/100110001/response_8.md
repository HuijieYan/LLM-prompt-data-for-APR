### Analysis:
1. The provided buggy function `request_httprepr` is failing when it encounters a non-HTTP request URL, specifically when trying to extract the hostname from a non-HTTP URL.
2. The error occurs in the line `s += b"Host: " + to_bytes(parsed.hostname) + b"\r\n"` where `parsed.hostname` is None for non-HTTP URLs, causing the `to_bytes` function to raise a `TypeError`.
3. The bug is caused because the function assumes that `parsed.hostname` always contains a value which is not the case for non-HTTP URLs. The failing test uses non-HTTP URLs causing the bug to manifest.
4. To fix the bug, we need to handle the case where `parsed.hostname` is None, i.e., for non-HTTP URLs. We should also ensure that the function can handle cases where `parsed` object may have missing attributes.
5. The corrected version of the function is provided below:

### Corrected version of the function:
```python
def request_httprepr(request):
    """Return the raw HTTP representation (as bytes) of the given request.
    This is provided only for reference since it's not the actual stream of
    bytes that will be send when performing the request (that's controlled
    by Twisted).
    """
    parsed = urlparse_cached(request)
    path = urlunparse(('', '', parsed.path or '/', parsed.params, parsed.query, ''))
    s = to_bytes(request.method) + b" " + to_bytes(path) + b" HTTP/1.1\r\n"
    
    if parsed.hostname:  # Check if hostname is available
        s += b"Host: " + to_bytes(parsed.hostname) + b"\r\n"
    
    if request.headers:
        s += request.headers.to_string() + b"\r\n"
    
    s += b"\r\n"
    s += request.body
    return s
```

By checking if `parsed.hostname` is not None before concatenating it in the `s` string, we ensure that the function does not raise a `TypeError` for non-HTTP URLs. This corrected version should now be able to handle non-HTTP URLs without errors.
