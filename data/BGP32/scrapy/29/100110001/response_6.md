The bug in the `request_httprepr` function is occurring because the `parsed` object returned by `urlparse_cached(request)` does not have a `hostname` attribute when the URL scheme is not `http` or `https`. This is leading to a `NoneType` error when trying to access `parsed.hostname` in the line `s += b"Host: " + to_bytes(parsed.hostname) + b"\r\n"`.

To fix this bug, we need to check if `parsed.hostname` exists before trying to concatenate it in the string. If `parsed.hostname` is not available (which is the case for non-HTTP URLs like `file` or `ftp`), we can skip adding the `Host` header to the request.

Here is the corrected version of the `request_httprepr` function:

```python
def request_httprepr(request):
    """Return the raw HTTP representation (as bytes) of the given request.
    This is provided only for reference since it's not the actual stream of
    bytes that will be send when performing the request (that's controlled
    by Twisted).
    """
    parsed = urlparse_cached(request)
    path = urlunparse(('', '', parsed.path or '/', parsed.params, parsed.query, ''))
    s = to_bytes(request.method) + b" " + to_bytes(path) + b" HTTP/1.1\r\n"
    if parsed.hostname:
        s += b"Host: " + to_bytes(parsed.hostname) + b"\r\n"
    if request.headers:
        s += request.headers.to_string() + b"\r\n"
    s += b"\r\n"
    s += request.body
    return s
```

With this modification, the function will first check if `parsed.hostname` exists before trying to use it in the HTTP request representation. This change will prevent the `NoneType` error when dealing with non-HTTP URLs like `file` or `ftp`.
