### Analysis:
The failing test is trying to invoke the `request_httprepr` function with a non-HTTP request, specifically a file-based and FTP-based request. The error message indicates that the error is occurring when trying to convert the parsed hostname to bytes in the `request_httprepr` function.

### Error Location:
The error is happening in the statement:
```python
s += b"Host: " + to_bytes(parsed.hostname) + b"\r\n"
```
The error indicates that `parsed.hostname` is `None`, causing the `to_bytes` function to raise a `TypeError`.

### Cause of the Bug:
The issue arises because the parsed URL does not always contain a hostname. For non-HTTP URLs like file:// and ftp:// URLs, the `hostname` attribute is not populated in the parsed result, leading to a `None` value being passed to the `to_bytes` function.

### Fix Strategy:
To fix this bug, we need to handle the case where `parsed.hostname` is `None` for non-HTTP URLs. We should first check if `parsed.hostname` is not `None` before trying to convert it to bytes.

### Corrected Function:
```python
def request_httprepr(request):
    """Return the raw HTTP representation (as bytes) of the given request.
    This is provided only for reference since it's not the actual stream of
    bytes that will be sent when performing the request (that's controlled
    by Twisted).
    """
    parsed = urlparse_cached(request)
    path = urlunparse(('', '', parsed.path or '/', parsed.params, parsed.query, ''))
    s = to_bytes(request.method) + b" " + to_bytes(path) + b" HTTP/1.1\r\n"
    
    if parsed.hostname:
        s += b"Host: " + to_bytes(parsed.hostname) + b"\r\n"
    
    if request.headers:
        s += request.headers.to_string() + b"\r\n"
    
    s += b"\r\n"
    s += request.body
    return s
```

By including the `if parsed.hostname` condition before trying to convert `parsed.hostname` to bytes, we ensure that the function does not raise a `TypeError` for non-HTTP URLs.
