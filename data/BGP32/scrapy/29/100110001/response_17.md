### Analysis:
1. The failing test is calling the `request_httprepr` function with a non-HTTP request URL (`file:///tmp/foo.txt`).
2. The failing point in the `request_httprepr` function is at line 82 where it tries to concatenate the host with the request method and path.
3. The error message indicates that the `parsed.hostname` is `None` which is causing the `to_bytes` function to fail with a `TypeError`.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is caused because for non-HTTP requests, `parsed.hostname` is `None`, and the `to_bytes` function does not handle `None` inputs, resulting in a `TypeError`.

### Bug Fix:
To fix the bug, we need to handle the case where `parsed.hostname` is `None` in a way that does not cause a `TypeError` when converting it to bytes.

### Corrected Function:
```python
def request_httprepr(request):
    parsed = urlparse_cached(request)
    path = urlunparse(('', '', parsed.path or '/', parsed.params, parsed.query, ''))
    s = to_bytes(request.method) + b" " + to_bytes(path) + b" HTTP/1.1\r\n"
    
    host = to_bytes(parsed.hostname) if parsed.hostname else b''
    s += b"Host: " + host + b"\r\n"
    
    if request.headers:
        s += request.headers.to_string() + b"\r\n"
    
    s += b"\r\n"
    s += request.body
    return s
```

With this correction, we handle the case where `parsed.hostname` is `None` by checking for it explicitly before trying to convert it to bytes. Now, the corrected function should be able to handle non-HTTP requests without causing a `TypeError`.
