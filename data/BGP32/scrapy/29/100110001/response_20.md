## Analysis
The error message indicates that the `parsed.hostname` or `parsed` object itself is `None`, causing the `TypeError` in the `to_bytes` function since it expects a string type. This error occurs when dealing with non-HTTP requests like `file://` or `ftp://`.

## Bug Cause
The bug is caused by not handling non-HTTP requests properly in the `request_httprepr` function. When processing non-HTTP requests, the `parsed.hostname` could be `None`, leading to the `TypeError` when trying to convert it to bytes.

## Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to add a conditional check to handle cases where the `parsed.hostname` is `None` (in the case of non-HTTP requests). We should have a fallback mechanism to use the `parsed.netloc` or the entire `urlunparse` result.

## Corrected Version
```python
def request_httprepr(request):
    """Return the raw HTTP representation (as bytes) of the given request.
    This is provided only for reference since it's not the actual stream of
    bytes that will be send when performing the request (that's controlled
    by Twisted).
    """
    parsed = urlparse_cached(request)
    path = urlunparse(('', '', parsed.path or '/', parsed.params, parsed.query, ''))
    
    # Handling non-HTTP requests like file:// or ftp://
    host = parsed.hostname or parsed.netloc
    
    s = to_bytes(request.method) + b" " + to_bytes(path) + b" HTTP/1.1\r\n"
    s += b"Host: " + to_bytes(host) + b"\r\n"
    if request.headers:
        s += request.headers.to_string() + b"\r\n"
    s += b"\r\n"
    s += request.body
    return s
```

By using the corrected version provided above, the function now includes a check to handle the case where `parsed.hostname` might be `None`, ensuring that it functions correctly for both HTTP and non-HTTP requests. This fix should make the function pass the failing test.
