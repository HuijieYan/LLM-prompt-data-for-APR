## Analyze the buggy function and its relationship with test code, corresponding error message
The buggy function `request_httprepr` is intended to return the raw HTTP representation (as bytes) of a given request. The function seems to be failing when handling non-HTTP requests, as indicated by the failing test `test_request_httprepr_for_non_http_request`. The error occurs specifically when trying to concatenate the hostname to the request `s` string.

## Potential error locations within the buggy function
The error message indicates that the `parsed.hostname` is `None`, leading to the `TypeError` in the `to_bytes` function.

## Cause of the bug
The bug is caused when trying to concatenate the hostname to the `s` string without properly handling the case when the hostname is `None`. This causes the `to_bytes` function to fail when it expects a unicode, str, or bytes object but receives a `NoneType`.

## Strategy for fixing the bug
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that we handle the case when the hostname parsed from the request is `None`. One way to address this is by checking if the hostname is `None` before concatenating it to the `s` string and handling it based on the condition.

## Corrected version of the function:

```python
def request_httprepr(request):
    parsed = urlparse_cached(request)
    path = urlunparse(('', '', parsed.path or '/', parsed.params, parsed.query, ''))
    s = to_bytes(request.method) + b" " + to_bytes(path) + b" HTTP/1.1\r\n"
    
    if parsed.hostname:
        s += b"Host: " + to_bytes(parsed.hostname) + b"\r\n"
        
    if request.headers:
        s += request.headers.to_string() + b"\r\n"
    
    s += b"\r\n"
    s += request.body
    return s
```

By adding a conditional check before concatenating the hostname, we ensure that the `to_bytes` function will not be called with a `NoneType`, preventing the `TypeError`. This corrected version of the function should pass the failing test case provided.
