### Analysis
The error occurs in the `request_httprepr` function when trying to concatenate the `b"Host: "` part with the `parsed.hostname`. The `parsed.hostname` can be `None` for non-HTTP URLs like file or ftp, leading to the error.

### Bug Cause
The bug is caused by the assumption that `parsed.hostname` will always have a value, which is not true for non-HTTP URLs. This assumption leads to a `TypeError` when trying to concatenate `b"Host: "` with `None`.

### Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to handle the case when `parsed.hostname` is `None`. We can check if `parsed.hostname` is not `None` before concatenating it with `b"Host: "`.

### Corrected Version
```python
from six.moves.urllib.parse import urlunparse
from scrapy.utils.python import to_bytes, to_native_str
from scrapy.utils.httpobj import urlparse_cached
from scrapy.http.request import Request  # assuming the Request class is imported

def request_httprepr(request):
    """Return the raw HTTP representation (as bytes) of the given request.
    This is provided only for reference since it's not the actual stream of
    bytes that will be send when performing the request (that's controlled
    by Twisted).
    """
    parsed = urlparse_cached(request)
    path = urlunparse(('', '', parsed.path or '/', parsed.params, parsed.query, ''))
    s = to_bytes(request.method) + b" " + to_bytes(path) + b" HTTP/1.1\r\n"
    if parsed.hostname is not None:
        s += b"Host: " + to_bytes(parsed.hostname) + b"\r\n"
    if request.headers:
        s += request.headers.to_string() + b"\r\n"
    s += b"\r\n"
    s += request.body
    return s
```

With this correction, the function will now check if `parsed.hostname` is not `None` before concatenating it with `b"Host: "`, avoiding the `TypeError` when `parsed.hostname` is `None`.
