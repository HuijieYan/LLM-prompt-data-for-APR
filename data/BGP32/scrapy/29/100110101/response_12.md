Based on the error message and the analysis, the bug occurs because the `parsed` object does not always contain the `hostname` attribute, which results in a `NoneType` error when trying to access it in the `s += b"Host: " + to_bytes(parsed.hostname) + b"\r\n"` line.

To fix this bug, we need to handle the case where `parsed` does not have a `hostname` attribute. We can do this by checking if `parsed.hostname` is `None` before attempting to concatenate it in the `s += b"Host: " + to_bytes(parsed.hostname) + b"\r\n"` line.

Here is the corrected version of the `request_httprepr` function:

```python
def request_httprepr(request):
    """Return the raw HTTP representation (as bytes) of the given request.
    This is provided only for reference since it's not the actual stream of
    bytes that will be send when performing the request (that's controlled
    by Twisted).
    """
    parsed = urlparse_cached(request)
    path = urlunparse(('', '', parsed.path or '/', parsed.params, parsed.query, ''))
    s = to_bytes(request.method) + b" " + to_bytes(path) + b" HTTP/1.1\r\n"
    
    if parsed.hostname is not None:
        s += b"Host: " + to_bytes(parsed.hostname) + b"\r\n"
    
    if request.headers:
        s += request.headers.to_string() + b"\r\n"
    s += b"\r\n"
    s += request.body
    return s
```

With this fix, the function should now handle cases where `parsed.hostname` is `None` and return the correct raw HTTP representation without raising a `NoneType` error.
