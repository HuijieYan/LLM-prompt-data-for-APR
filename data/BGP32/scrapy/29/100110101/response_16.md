## Analysis
The error is caused by the `parsed.hostname` being `None` when the scheme is not HTTP or HTTPS. This triggers a `TypeError` in the `to_bytes` function because it expects a string, but it receives a `NoneType`. 

## Bug Fix Strategy
We need to handle the case where `parsed.hostname` is `None` by providing a default value for the host in the HTTP request. We can use the `netloc` attribute of the parsed URL as a fallback. 

## The corrected version of the function
```python
def request_httprepr(request):
    """Return the raw HTTP representation (as bytes) of the given request.
    This is provided only for reference since it's not the actual stream of
    bytes that will be send when performing the request (that's controlled
    by Twisted).
    """
    parsed = urlparse_cached(request)
    path = urlunparse(('', '', parsed.path or '/', parsed.params, parsed.query, ''))
    host = parsed.hostname if parsed.hostname else parsed.netloc
    s = to_bytes(request.method) + b" " + to_bytes(path) + b" HTTP/1.1\r\n"
    s += b"Host: " + to_bytes(host) + b"\r\n"
    if request.headers:
        s += request.headers.to_string() + b"\r\n"
    s += b"\r\n"
    s += request.body
    return s
```

Now, with the corrected function, both test cases should pass successfully.
