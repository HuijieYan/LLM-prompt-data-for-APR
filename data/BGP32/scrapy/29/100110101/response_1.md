### Correction:

The error occurs because the `parsed.hostname` attribute is `None` for non-HTTP requests, resulting in a `NoneType` error when trying to convert it to bytes.

To fix this issue, we can modify the code to handle the case where `parsed.hostname` is `None` by providing a default value for the host in the HTTP request representation.

Here is the corrected version of the `request_httprepr` function:

```python
def request_httprepr(request):
    """Return the raw HTTP representation (as bytes) of the given request.
    This is provided only for reference since it's not the actual stream of
    bytes that will be send when performing the request (that's controlled
    by Twisted).
    """
    parsed = urlparse_cached(request)
    path = urlunparse(('', '', parsed.path or '/', parsed.params, parsed.query, ''))
    
    host = parsed.hostname if parsed.hostname else b'localhost'  # Add a default host value if parsed.hostname is None
    
    s = to_bytes(request.method) + b" " + to_bytes(path) + b" HTTP/1.1\r\n"
    s += b"Host: " + to_bytes(host) + b"\r\n"
    if request.headers:
        s += request.headers.to_string() + b"\r\n"
    s += b"\r\n"
    s += request.body
    return s
```

This correction adds a default host value ('localhost') when `parsed.hostname` is `None`, preventing the `TypeError` that was occurring before.

With this correction, the function should now pass the failing test cases and produce the expected output values mentioned in the test cases.
