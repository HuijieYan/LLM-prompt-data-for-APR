### Analysis:
The error occurs because the `parsed.hostname` can be `None` if the URL scheme is not `http` or `https`. This causes the `to_bytes` function to raise a `TypeError` since it expects a string but is receiving a `NoneType`.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix this bug, we need to handle the case where the hostname is `None`. We can modify the code to check if `parsed.hostname` is `None` before trying to convert it to bytes.

### The corrected version of the function:

```python
def request_httprepr(request):
    """Return the raw HTTP representation (as bytes) of the given request.
    This is provided only for reference since it's not the actual stream of
    bytes that will be send when performing the request (that's controlled
    by Twisted).
    """
    parsed = urlparse_cached(request)
    path = urlunparse(('', '', parsed.path or '/', parsed.params, parsed.query, ''))
    s = to_bytes(request.method) + b" " + to_bytes(path) + b" HTTP/1.1\r\n"
    if parsed.hostname is not None:
        s += b"Host: " + to_bytes(parsed.hostname) + b"\r\n"
    if request.headers:
        s += request.headers.to_string() + b"\r\n"
    s += b"\r\n"
    s += request.body
    return s
```

After applying this fix, the function should now handle cases where the `parsed.hostname` is `None`, preventing the `TypeError` from occurring. This corrected version should pass the failing tests and return the expected output values.
