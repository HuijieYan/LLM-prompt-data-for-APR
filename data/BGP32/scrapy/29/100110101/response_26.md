The bug in the `request_httprepr` function is caused by the fact that when the URL scheme is not 'http' or 'https', the `hostname` attribute of the parsed result can be None. This causes an error when trying to concatenate it in the function.

To fix this bug, we need to handle the case where `parsed.hostname` is None separately and adjust the logic accordingly. We can check if `parsed.hostname` is None and set it to an empty string in that case.

Here is the corrected version of the `request_httprepr` function:

```python
def request_httprepr(request):
    """Return the raw HTTP representation (as bytes) of the given request.
    This is provided only for reference since it's not the actual stream of
    bytes that will be send when performing the request (that's controlled
    by Twisted).
    """
    parsed = urlparse_cached(request)
    path = urlunparse(('', '', parsed.path or '/', parsed.params, parsed.query, ''))
    
    hostname = to_bytes(parsed.hostname) if parsed.hostname else b''
    
    s = to_bytes(request.method) + b" " + to_bytes(path) + b" HTTP/1.1\r\n"
    s += b"Host: " + hostname + b"\r\n"
    
    if request.headers:
        s += request.headers.to_string() + b"\r\n"
    
    s += b"\r\n"
    s += request.body
    
    return s
```

With this correction, the function should now handle cases where `parsed.hostname` is None without raising an error. This will allow the function to pass the failing test.
