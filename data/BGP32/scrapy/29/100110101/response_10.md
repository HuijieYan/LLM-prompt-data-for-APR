### Analysis:
1. The `to_bytes` function is used to convert text to bytes, but it throws a `TypeError` when the `parsed.hostname` is `None`. This occurs for non-HTTP requests such as `file://` or `ftp://` where the `hostname` might be `None`.
2. The issue is identified in the line `s += b"Host: " + to_bytes(parsed.hostname) + b"\r\n"`.
3. The failing test case is providing a non-HTTP request which triggers the bug. The `parsed.hostname` is `None` for such requests causing the `TypeError`.
4. To fix this, we can check if `parsed.hostname` is `None` before trying to convert it to bytes. If it is `None`, we can provide a default value like an empty string.

### Solution:
```python
def request_httprepr(request):
    """Return the raw HTTP representation (as bytes) of the given request.
    This is provided only for reference since it's not the actual stream of
    bytes that will be send when performing the request (that's controlled
    by Twisted).
    """
    parsed = urlparse_cached(request)
    path = urlunparse(('', '', parsed.path or '/', parsed.params, parsed.query, ''))
    s = to_bytes(request.method) + b" " + to_bytes(path) + b" HTTP/1.1\r\n"
    s += b"Host: " + to_bytes(parsed.hostname or '') + b"\r\n"  # Check if hostname is None and provide default value
    if request.headers:
        s += request.headers.to_string() + b"\r\n"
    s += b"\r\n"
    s += request.body
    return s
```

The updated function checks if `parsed.hostname` is `None` and substitutes it with an empty string before converting it to bytes. This will prevent the `TypeError` and the function should now work correctly for non-HTTP requests.
