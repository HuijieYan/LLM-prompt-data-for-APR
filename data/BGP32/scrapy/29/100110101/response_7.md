The issue in the buggy function `request_httprepr` lies in the line `s += b"Host: " + to_bytes(parsed.hostname) + b"\r\n"`. The `parsed.hostname` value is None when the URL scheme is not set to 'http' or 'https', resulting in a TypeError when trying to convert it to bytes using the `to_bytes` function.

To fix this issue, we need to handle the case where `parsed.hostname` is None. We can modify the line to check whether `parsed.hostname` is None and provide a default value in that case.

Here is the corrected version of the `request_httprepr` function:

```python
def request_httprepr(request):
    """Return the raw HTTP representation (as bytes) of the given request.
    This is provided only for reference since it's not the actual stream of
    bytes that will be send when performing the request (that's controlled
    by Twisted).
    """
    parsed = urlparse_cached(request)
    path = urlunparse(('', '', parsed.path or '/', parsed.params, parsed.query, ''))
    s = to_bytes(request.method) + b" " + to_bytes(path) + b" HTTP/1.1\r\n"
    
    host = parsed.hostname or b"localhost"  # Providing a default value if hostname is None
    s += b"Host: " + to_bytes(host) + b"\r\n"
    
    if request.headers:
        s += request.headers.to_string() + b"\r\n"
        
    s += b"\r\n"
    s += request.body
    return s
```

With this correction, the function will handle cases where the hostname is None and provide a default value of "localhost". This change ensures that the function will not throw a TypeError when converting the hostname to bytes.

The corrected function should now pass the failing test cases and satisfy the expected input/output values.
