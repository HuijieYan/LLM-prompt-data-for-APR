## Correction

The issue in the buggy function arises from the fact that the `parsed.hostname` attribute can be `None` if the URL does not contain a hostname. In such cases, the `to_bytes` function in the buggy part of the code raises a `TypeError` since it expects a valid string but receives `None`.

To address this problem, we need to handle the case where `parsed.hostname` is `None` separately before performing the byte conversion.

Here is the corrected version of the `request_httprepr` function:

```python
def request_httprepr(request):
    """Return the raw HTTP representation (as bytes) of the given request.
    This is provided only for reference since it's not the actual stream of
    bytes that will be send when performing the request (that's controlled
    by Twisted).
    """
    parsed = urlparse_cached(request)
    path = urlunparse(('', '', parsed.path or '/', parsed.params, parsed.query, ''))
    s = to_bytes(request.method) + b" " + to_bytes(path) + b" HTTP/1.1\r\n"
    if parsed.hostname:
        s += b"Host: " + to_bytes(parsed.hostname) + b"\r\n"
    if request.headers:
        s += request.headers.to_string() + b"\r\n"
    s += b"\r\n"
    s += request.body
    return s
```

With this correction, we first check if `parsed.hostname` is not `None` before adding it to the byte string. This modification ensures that the function can handle URLs without hostnames properly.

By making this change, the `request_httprepr` function should now pass the failing test cases and provide the expected output values for both HTTP and non-HTTP URLs.
