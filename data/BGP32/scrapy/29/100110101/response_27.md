The bug in the provided function `request_httprepr` is due to the fact that the `parsed.hostname` can be `None` when the URL scheme is not 'http' or 'https', which leads to a `NoneType` error when trying to convert it to bytes using `to_bytes`. To fix this, we need to handle the case where `parsed.hostname` is `None` separately.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def request_httprepr(request):
    """Return the raw HTTP representation (as bytes) of the given request.
    This is provided only for reference since it's not the actual stream of
    bytes that will be sent when performing the request (that's controlled
    by Twisted).
    """
    parsed = urlparse_cached(request)
    path = urlunparse(('', '', parsed.path or '/', parsed.params, parsed.query, ''))
    s = to_bytes(request.method) + b" " + to_bytes(path) + b" HTTP/1.1\r\n"
    s += b"Host: "
    if parsed.hostname:
        s += to_bytes(parsed.hostname)
    s += b"\r\n"
    
    if request.headers:
        s += request.headers.to_string() + b"\r\n"
    s += b"\r\n"
    s += request.body
    return s
```

With this correction, we first check if the `parsed.hostname` is not `None` before converting it to bytes. This will prevent the `NoneType` error that was occurring.

The corrected function should now pass the failing test case with the expected input/output values specified.
