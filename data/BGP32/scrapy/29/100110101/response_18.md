### Analysis
The error occurs when trying to concatenate the "Host" header with the parsed hostname. The error message indicates that the `parsed.hostname` is `None`. This is likely due to the fact that for non-HTTP URLs, the `hostname` may not be present in the parsed result.

### Bug Cause
The bug occurs because the hostname is not always present in the parsed result for non-HTTP URLs. In this case, trying to concatenate `None` with a byte string causes a `TypeError`.

### Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to handle the case where `parsed.hostname` is `None`. We should conditionally append the "Host" header based on whether the hostname is present or not.

### Corrected Function
```python
def request_httprepr(request):
    """Return the raw HTTP representation (as bytes) of the given request.
    This is provided only for reference since it's not the actual stream of
    bytes that will be send when performing the request (that's controlled
    by Twisted).
    """
    parsed = urlparse_cached(request)
    path = urlunparse(('', '', parsed.path or '/', parsed.params, parsed.query, ''))
    s = to_bytes(request.method) + b" " + to_bytes(path) + b" HTTP/1.1\r\n"
    
    if parsed.scheme == 'http' or parsed.scheme == 'https':
        s += b"Host: " + to_bytes(parsed.hostname) + b"\r\n"
        
    if request.headers:
        s += request.headers.to_string() + b"\r\n"
        
    s += b"\r\n"
    s += request.body
    return s
```

With this fix, we check if the scheme is 'http' or 'https' before including the "Host" header in the request. This way, we avoid the `NoneType` error when dealing with non-HTTP URLs. The corrected function should now pass the failing test cases.
