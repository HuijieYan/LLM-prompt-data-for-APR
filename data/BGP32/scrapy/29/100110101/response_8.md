1. Analyzing the buggy function, `request_httprepr`, we see that it is failing when it tries to concatenate the `Host:` header with the parsed hostname. The error message indicates that the `parsed.hostname` value is `None`, leading to a `TypeError` in the `to_bytes` function.

2. The potential error locations within the buggy function are the lines where `parsed.hostname` is accessed and concatenated to the string.

3. The cause of the bug is that the `parsed.hostname` attribute is `None` for non-HTTP requests like `file://` and `ftp://`. The buggy function assumes that there is always a hostname present, leading to the `TypeError`.

4. To fix the bug, we need to handle the case where `parsed.hostname` might be `None` for non-HTTP requests. We can update the function to check if `parsed.hostname` is `None` and handle it accordingly.

5. Here is the corrected version of the `request_httprepr` function:

```python
def request_httprepr(request):
    parsed = urlparse_cached(request)
    path = urlunparse(('', '', parsed.path or '/', parsed.params, parsed.query, ''))
    
    s = to_bytes(request.method) + b" " + to_bytes(path) + b" HTTP/1.1\r\n"
    
    if parsed.hostname is not None:  # Check if hostname exists before adding to the request
        s += b"Host: " + to_bytes(parsed.hostname) + b"\r\n"
    
    if request.headers:
        s += request.headers.to_string() + b"\r\n"
    
    s += b"\r\n"
    s += request.body
    
    return s
```

With this correction, the function will handle cases where `parsed.hostname` might be `None`, preventing the `TypeError` that was occurring previously.
