### Analysis:
The error message indicates that the `to_bytes` function is receiving a `NoneType` argument, causing a `TypeError` when it expects a unicode, str, or bytes object. This is likely due to the `parsed.hostname` being `None` in the `parsed` object retrieved from the URL.

### Bug Cause:
The bug occurs because in the case of URLs with schemes like `file://` or `ftp://`, there might not always be a hostname component. The code does not check for this possibility, leading to `parsed.hostname` being `None`.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix this bug, we need to handle cases where `parsed.hostname` is `None` and provide a default value instead to avoid the `TypeError` in the `to_bytes` function.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def request_httprepr(request):
    """Return the raw HTTP representation (as bytes) of the given request.
    This is provided only for reference since it's not the actual stream of
    bytes that will be send when performing the request (that's controlled
    by Twisted).
    """
    parsed = urlparse_cached(request)
    path = urlunparse(('', '', parsed.path or '/', parsed.params, parsed.query, ''))
    s = to_bytes(request.method) + b" " + to_bytes(path) + b" HTTP/1.1\r\n"
    
    host = to_bytes(parsed.hostname) if parsed.hostname else b''
    s += b"Host: " + host + b"\r\n"
    
    if request.headers:
        s += request.headers.to_string() + b"\r\n"
        
    s += b"\r\n"
    s += request.body
    
    return s
```

By adding a check `if parsed.hostname else b''` and providing a default value if `parsed.hostname` is `None`, we prevent the `TypeError` from occurring. This corrected version should now pass the failing test cases and satisfy the expected input/output variable values.
