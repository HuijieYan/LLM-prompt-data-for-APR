### Analysis:
The error occurs because the `parsed.hostname` is `None` for non-HTTP requests, and the `to_bytes` function expects either a Unicode string, a regular string, or bytes. In this case, it receives `None`, leading to a `TypeError`.

### Bug:
The bug is caused by trying to convert a `None` value to bytes using the `to_bytes` function for the `parsed.hostname` when handling non-HTTP requests.

### Fix:
To fix the bug, we need to handle the case where `parsed.hostname` is `None` separately and ensure it doesn't cause a `TypeError` in the `to_bytes` function.

### Corrected Function:
```python
def request_httprepr(request):
    """Return the raw HTTP representation (as bytes) of the given request.
    This is provided only for reference since it's not the actual stream of
    bytes that will be sent when performing the request (that's controlled
    by Twisted).
    """
    parsed = urlparse_cached(request)
    path = urlunparse(('', '', parsed.path or '/', parsed.params, parsed.query, ''))
    s = to_bytes(request.method) + b" " + to_bytes(path) + b" HTTP/1.1\r\n"
    if parsed.hostname:
        s += b"Host: " + to_bytes(parsed.hostname) + b"\r\n"
    if request.headers:
        s += request.headers.to_string() + b"\r\n"
    s += b"\r\n"
    s += request.body
    return s
``` 

After applying this fix, the function should handle the case where `parsed.hostname` is `None` for non-HTTP requests, preventing the `TypeError` from occurring.
