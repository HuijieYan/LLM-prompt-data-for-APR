The bug in the `request_httprepr` function lies in the usage of `urlunparse` method with an empty string as the first argument. This causes the URL scheme to be empty in the resulting URL, leading to incorrect output.

The fix for this bug involves checking if the URL scheme exists before calling `urlunparse`. If the scheme exists, it should be included in the resulting URL. Otherwise, it should default to 'http' to ensure a valid URL representation.

Here is the corrected version of the `request_httprepr` function:

```python
# The corrected version of the request_httprepr function
def request_httprepr(request):
    """Return the raw HTTP representation (as bytes) of the given request.
    This is provided only for reference since it's not the actual stream of
    bytes that will be send when performing the request (that's controlled
    by Twisted).
    """
    parsed = urlparse_cached(request)
    path = urlunparse((parsed.scheme or 'http', '', parsed.path or '/', parsed.params, parsed.query, ''))
    s = to_bytes(request.method) + b" " + to_bytes(path) + b" HTTP/1.1\r\n"
    s += b"Host: " + to_bytes(parsed.hostname) + b"\r\n"
    if request.headers:
        s += request.headers.to_string() + b"\r\n"
    s += b"\r\n"
    s += request.body
    return s
```

With this correction, the `urlunparse` method now receives a tuple with the scheme set to 'http' if it was missing in the original URL. This ensures that the resulting URL is correctly formatted and the test case for non-HTTP URLs should pass successfully.
