The bug in the `request_httprepr` function is related to the usage of the `parsed.hostname` attribute when constructing the raw HTTP representation. This attribute does not exist for non-HTTP URLs like "file://" or "ftp://", causing the function to raise an AttributeError. 

To fix this bug, we need to modify the function to handle non-HTTP URLs properly. We can check if the URL scheme is "http" before attempting to access `parsed.hostname`.

Here is the corrected version of the `request_httprepr` function:
```python
def request_httprepr(request):
    """Return the raw HTTP representation (as bytes) of the given request.
    This is provided only for reference since it's not the actual stream of
    bytes that will be sent when performing the request (that's controlled
    by Twisted).
    """
    parsed = urlparse_cached(request)
    path = urlunparse(('', '', parsed.path or '/', parsed.params, parsed.query, ''))
    s = to_bytes(request.method) + b" " + to_bytes(path) + b" HTTP/1.1\r\n"
    if parsed.scheme == 'http':  # Check if the URL scheme is 'http'
        s += b"Host: " + to_bytes(parsed.hostname) + b"\r\n"
    if request.headers:
        s += request.headers.to_string() + b"\r\n"
    s += b"\r\n"
    s += request.body
    return s
```

With this modification, the `request_httprepr` function will now properly handle non-HTTP URLs and not raise an AttributeError when constructing the raw HTTP representation.
