The bug in the `request_httprepr` function is caused by the fact that it is expecting HTTP requests only (requests with a scheme of "http" or "https"). When it encounters a non-HTTP request (e.g., "file" or "ftp"), it fails to handle it correctly.

To fix this bug, we can modify the function to handle all types of requests, regardless of their scheme. We can simply include the scheme in the raw HTTP representation returned by the function.

Here's the corrected version of the `request_httprepr` function:

```python
def request_httprepr(request):
    """Return the raw HTTP representation (as bytes) of the given request.
    This is provided only for reference since it's not the actual stream of
    bytes that will be send when performing the request (that's controlled
    by Twisted).
    """
    parsed = urlparse_cached(request)
    path = urlunparse((parsed.scheme, parsed.netloc, parsed.path, parsed.params, parsed.query, ''))
    s = to_bytes(request.method) + b" " + to_bytes(path) + b" HTTP/1.1\r\n"
    s += b"Host: " + to_bytes(parsed.hostname) + b"\r\n"
    if request.headers:
        s += request.headers.to_string() + b"\r\n"
    s += b"\r\n"
    s += request.body
    return s
```

With this correction, the `request_httprepr` function will be able to handle non-HTTP requests as well. The scheme of the request will be included in the raw HTTP representation returned by the function.

This corrected version should now pass the failing test case `test_request_httprepr_for_non_http_request`.
