The bug in the `request_httprepr` function is due to the fact that it assumes the input requests are HTTP requests and tries to create an HTTP representation accordingly. However, in the failing test case provided, the input requests are non-HTTP requests (file and ftp requests).

To fix this bug, we can modify the `request_httprepr` function to handle non-HTTP requests gracefully. Specifically, we can create a generic representation for non-HTTP requests by including the scheme in the request line.

Here is the corrected version of the `request_httprepr` function:

```python
# The corrected version of the function
def request_httprepr(request):
    """Return the raw HTTP representation (as bytes) of the given request.
    This is provided only for reference since it's not the actual stream of
    bytes that will be send when performing the request (that's controlled
    by Twisted).
    """
    parsed = urlparse_cached(request)
    if parsed.scheme:
        request_line = to_bytes(parsed.scheme) + b" " + to_bytes(parsed.geturl()) + b" HTTP/1.1\r\n"
    else:
        request_line = b"GET " + to_bytes(parsed.geturl()) + b" HTTP/1.1\r\n"
    s = request_line
    s += b"Host: " + to_bytes(parsed.hostname) + b"\r\n"
    if request.headers:
        s += request.headers.to_string() + b"\r\n"
    s += b"\r\n"
    s += request.body
    return s
```

With this correction, the `request_httprepr` function will handle both HTTP and non-HTTP requests correctly. The function will generate a generic representation for non-HTTP requests by including the scheme in the request line.

After applying this fix, the failing test case `test_request_httprepr_for_non_http_request` should pass without any errors.
