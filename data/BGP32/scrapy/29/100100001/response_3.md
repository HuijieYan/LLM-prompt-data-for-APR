## Analysis:
The buggy function `request_httprepr` is designed to return the raw HTTP representation of a given request, but it has a bug when the request is not an HTTP request. The bug occurs when the request is not an HTTP request, like "file://" or "ftp://" requests.

## Potential Error:
The bug is likely to occur at the line `path = urlunparse(('', '', parsed.path or '/', parsed.params, parsed.query, ''))`, where it assumes the request always has a path. In the case of non-HTTP requests, such as "file://" or "ftp://" requests, the parsed object may not have a path attribute, leading to a None value being used in the urlunparse function.

## Cause of the Bug:
The bug occurs because the function tries to construct a URL even for non-HTTP requests without considering that some requests may not have a path component.

## Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to handle cases where the request is not an HTTP request and may not have a path component. We can check if the parsed object has a path attribute before constructing the path variable.

## Corrected Version:
```python
def request_httprepr(request):
    """Return the raw HTTP representation (as bytes) of the given request.
    This is provided only for reference since it's not the actual stream of
    bytes that will be send when performing the request (that's controlled
    by Twisted).
    """
    parsed = urlparse_cached(request)
    if parsed.path is not None:
        path = urlunparse(('', '', parsed.path, parsed.params, parsed.query, ''))
    else:
        path = '/'
    s = to_bytes(request.method) + b" " + to_bytes(path) + b" HTTP/1.1\r\n"
    s += b"Host: " + to_bytes(parsed.hostname) + b"\r\n"
    if request.headers:
        s += request.headers.to_string() + b"\r\n"
    s += b"\r\n"
    s += request.body
    return s
```

By checking if the path attribute of the parsed object is None, we prevent the bug from occurring when the request is not an HTTP request. This corrected version of the function should pass the failing test.
