The bug in the provided function `request_httprepr` stems from the assumption that all requests passed to it will be HTTP requests. However, there are cases where non-HTTP requests can be passed, such as "file://" or "ftp://" requests. 

To fix the bug, we need to add a check to handle non-HTTP requests appropriately and ensure that the function can handle them without causing errors.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def request_httprepr(request):
    """Return the raw HTTP representation (as bytes) of the given request.
    This is provided only for reference since it's not the actual stream of
    bytes that will be send when performing the request (that's controlled
    by Twisted).
    """
    parsed = urlparse_cached(request)
    if not parsed.scheme.startswith('http'):
        # Handle non-HTTP requests
        return to_bytes(request.method) + b" " + to_bytes(request.url) + b" HTTP/1.1\r\n\r\n" + request.body
       
    path = urlunparse(('', '', parsed.path or '/', parsed.params, parsed.query, ''))
    s = to_bytes(request.method) + b" " + to_bytes(path) + b" HTTP/1.1\r\n"
    s += b"Host: " + to_bytes(parsed.hostname) + b"\r\n"
    if request.headers:
        s += request.headers.to_string() + b"\r\n"
    s += b"\r\n"
    s += request.body
    return s
```

This adjusted function checks if the request is not an HTTP request based on the parsed scheme. If it is not an HTTP request, it constructs a basic HTTP representation with the method, URL, and body. This modification will allow the function to handle non-HTTP requests correctly without causing errors.
