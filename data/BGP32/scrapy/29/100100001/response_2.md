## Analysis:
The buggy function `request_httprepr` is intended to return the raw HTTP representation of a given request, but it is failing for non-HTTP requests such as "file://" or "ftp://". The issue seems to arise from the fact that the function assumes the request is an HTTP request and constructs the HTTP representation accordingly.

## Identified Issue:
The buggy function assumes that the request is always an HTTP request and constructs the HTTP representation without handling non-HTTP requests properly.

## Bug Cause:
The cause of the bug is that the function does not account for non-HTTP requests like "file://" or "ftp://" when constructing the raw HTTP representation. This leads to errors when trying to generate a valid HTTP representation for such requests.

## Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to first check if the request's scheme is HTTP before constructing the HTTP representation. If it is not an HTTP request, we should handle it differently or skip the construction of the HTTP representation altogether.

## Corrected Version of the Function:
Here is the corrected version of the `request_httprepr` function:

```python
def request_httprepr(request):
    """Return the raw HTTP representation (as bytes) of the given request.
    This is provided only for reference since it's not the actual stream of
    bytes that will be sent when performing the request (that's controlled
    by Twisted).
    """
    parsed = urlparse_cached(request)
    if parsed.scheme == 'http' or parsed.scheme == 'https':
        path = urlunparse(('', '', parsed.path or '/', parsed.params, parsed.query, ''))
        s = to_bytes(request.method) + b" " + to_bytes(path) + b" HTTP/1.1\r\n"
        s += b"Host: " + to_bytes(parsed.hostname) + b"\r\n"
        if request.headers:
            s += request.headers.to_string() + b"\r\n"
        s += b"\r\n"
        s += request.body
        return s
    else:
        # Handle non-HTTP requests differently or return None
        return None
```

With this corrected version, the function now checks if the request's scheme is either "http" or "https" before constructing the HTTP representation. If the request is not an HTTP request, the function either handles it differently or returns `None`. This change should make the function more robust and capable of handling a wider range of request types.
