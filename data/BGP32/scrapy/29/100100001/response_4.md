The bug in the `request_httprepr` function is caused by attempting to generate the HTTP representation of a non-HTTP request (e.g., "file://" or "ftp://"). When such non-HTTP requests are passed to the function, it tries to construct an HTTP representation using the provided information, which leads to errors.

To fix this bug, we can add a check in the function to handle non-HTTP requests differently and provide a suitable representation for them. One approach is to raise a specific error for non-HTTP requests to indicate that this function is only intended for HTTP requests.

Here is the corrected version of the `request_httprepr` function:

```python
def request_httprepr(request):
    """Return the raw HTTP representation (as bytes) of the given request.
    This is provided only for reference since it's not the actual stream of
    bytes that will be send when performing the request (that's controlled
    by Twisted).
    """
    parsed = urlparse_cached(request)
    if not parsed.scheme.startswith('http'):
        raise ValueError("HTTP representation is only supported for HTTP requests")
    
    path = urlunparse(('', '', parsed.path or '/', parsed.params, parsed.query, ''))
    s = to_bytes(request.method) + b" " + to_bytes(path) + b" HTTP/1.1\r\n"
    s += b"Host: " + to_bytes(parsed.hostname) + b"\r\n"
    if request.headers:
        s += request.headers.to_string() + b"\r\n"
    s += b"\r\n"
    s += request.body
    return s
```

With this modification, when a non-HTTP request is passed to the `request_httprepr` function, it will raise a `ValueError` exception instead of trying to construct an HTTP representation. This ensures that the function behaves correctly and does not encounter errors when handling non-HTTP requests.

The modified function should now pass the failing test for non-HTTP requests.
