The bug in the `request_httprepr` function is caused by the use of the `parsed.hostname` attribute without checking if it exists. In the failing test, the function is called with URLs that do not have a `hostname`, causing an AttributeError when trying to access `parsed.hostname`.

To fix this bug, we need to check if `parsed.hostname` exists before trying to use it. We can modify the function to check if `parsed.netloc` is not empty, and if not, use it as the `Host` header.

Here is the corrected version of the `request_httprepr` function:

```python
def request_httprepr(request):
    """Return the raw HTTP representation (as bytes) of the given request.
    This is provided only for reference since it's not the actual stream of
    bytes that will be send when performing the request (that's controlled
    by Twisted).
    """
    parsed = urlparse_cached(request)
    path = urlunparse(('', '', parsed.path or '/', parsed.params, parsed.query, ''))
    s = to_bytes(request.method) + b" " + to_bytes(path) + b" HTTP/1.1\r\n"
    if parsed.netloc:
        s += b"Host: " + to_bytes(parsed.netloc) + b"\r\n"
    if request.headers:
        s += request.headers.to_string() + b"\r\n"
    s += b"\r\n"
    s += request.body
    return s
```

Now, when the function is called with URLs that do not have a hostname, it will not raise an AttributeError and should pass the failing test.
