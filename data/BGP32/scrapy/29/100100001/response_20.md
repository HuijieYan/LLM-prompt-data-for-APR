The bug in the `request_httprepr` function stems from the assumption that the input request object will always contain a valid URL. When a non-HTTP URL is provided (such as "file://" or "ftp://"), the function fails to correctly handle these cases.

To fix the bug, we should modify the function to handle non-HTTP URLs gracefully by checking the scheme of the URL and adjusting the behavior accordingly.

Here is the corrected version of the `request_httprepr` function:

```python
# Fixed version of the function
def request_httprepr(request):
    """Return the raw HTTP representation (as bytes) of the given request.
    This is provided only for reference since it's not the actual stream of
    bytes that will be sent when performing the request (that's controlled
    by Twisted).
    """
    parsed = urlparse_cached(request)
    
    if parsed.scheme not in ['http', 'https']:
        s = to_bytes(request.method) + b" " + to_bytes(parsed.path) + b" HTTP/1.1\r\n"
        s += b"\r\n"
        s += request.body
        return s
    
    path = urlunparse(('', '', parsed.path or '/', parsed.params, parsed.query, ''))
    s = to_bytes(request.method) + b" " + to_bytes(path) + b" HTTP/1.1\r\n"
    s += b"Host: " + to_bytes(parsed.hostname) + b"\r\n"
    if request.headers:
        s += request.headers.to_string() + b"\r\n"
    s += b"\r\n"
    s += request.body
    return s
```

With this modification, the `request_httprepr` function will now handle non-HTTP URLs correctly by skipping the host and headers information for such URLs. This updated version should pass the failing test provided.
