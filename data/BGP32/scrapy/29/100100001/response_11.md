The bug in the `request_httprepr` function is caused by trying to treat non-HTTP requests as HTTP requests, resulting in an error when constructing the raw HTTP representation. The function assumes that the input requests are HTTP requests and tries to process them as such, leading to issues when dealing with non-HTTP requests like "ftp://" or "file://" URLs.

To fix this bug, we can add a check to ensure that the protocol in the URL is "http" before constructing the raw HTTP representation. If the protocol is not "http", we can handle these cases differently or simply return an empty byte string.

Here is the corrected version of the `request_httprepr` function:

```python
def request_httprepr(request):
    """Return the raw HTTP representation (as bytes) of the given request.
    This is provided only for reference since it's not the actual stream of
    bytes that will be send when performing the request (that's controlled
    by Twisted).
    """
    parsed = urlparse_cached(request)
    if parsed.scheme.lower() != 'http':
        return b'' # return empty byte string for non-HTTP requests
    path = urlunparse(('', '', parsed.path or '/', parsed.params, parsed.query, ''))
    s = to_bytes(request.method) + b" " + to_bytes(path) + b" HTTP/1.1\r\n"
    s += b"Host: " + to_bytes(parsed.hostname) + b"\r\n"
    if request.headers:
        s += request.headers.to_string() + b"\r\n"
    s += b"\r\n"
    s += request.body
    return s
```

With this fix in place, the `request_httprepr` function will now handle non-HTTP requests correctly by returning an empty byte string for those cases. This corrected version should pass the failing test for non-HTTP requests like "file://" or "ftp://" URLs.
