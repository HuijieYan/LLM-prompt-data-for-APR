The bug in the `request_httprepr` function occurs when processing non-HTTP requests (e.g., FTP requests). The function assumes that `parsed.hostname` will always be present based on the URL parsing, but for non-HTTP requests like FTP, `hostname` may not be present in the URL. This leads to an AttributeError when trying to access `parsed.hostname`.

To fix this bug:
1. Check if `parsed.hostname` is not `None` before trying to use it in the function.
2. If `parsed.hostname` is `None` (which is the case for non-HTTP requests), handle it gracefully by using an empty byte string instead.

Here is the corrected version of the `request_httprepr` function:

```python
def request_httprepr(request):
    """Return the raw HTTP representation (as bytes) of the given request.
    This is provided only for reference since it's not the actual stream of
    bytes that will be send when performing the request (that's controlled
    by Twisted).
    """
    parsed = urlparse_cached(request)
    path = urlunparse(('', '', parsed.path or '/', parsed.params, parsed.query, ''))
    s = to_bytes(request.method) + b" " + to_bytes(path) + b" HTTP/1.1\r\n"
    
    if parsed.hostname is not None:
        s += b"Host: " + to_bytes(parsed.hostname) + b"\r\n"

    if request.headers:
        s += request.headers.to_string() + b"\r\n"
    
    s += b"\r\n"
    s += request.body
    return s
```

With this correction, the function will handle non-HTTP requests correctly and avoid the AttributeError when dealing with URLs that do not have a `hostname` attribute.
