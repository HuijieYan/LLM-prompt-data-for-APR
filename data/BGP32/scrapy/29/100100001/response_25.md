The bug in the `request_httprepr` function is caused by the assumption that the request always contains a valid URL. When the URL in the request is not of the HTTP protocol, such as in the case of "file://" or "ftp://", the function encounters errors while trying to parse the URL and construct the HTTP representation.

To fix this bug, we need to handle non-HTTP requests by checking the protocol scheme before constructing the HTTP representation.

Here is the corrected version of the `request_httprepr` function:
```python
def request_httprepr(request):
    if request.url.startswith("http"):
        parsed = urlparse_cached(request)
        path = urlunparse(('', '', parsed.path or '/', parsed.params, parsed.query, ''))
        s = to_bytes(request.method) + b" " + to_bytes(path) + b" HTTP/1.1\r\n"
        s += b"Host: " + to_bytes(parsed.hostname) + b"\r\n"
        if request.headers:
            s += request.headers.to_string() + b"\r\n"
        s += b"\r\n"
        s += request.body
        return s
    else:
        # Handle non-HTTP requests
        return to_bytes(request.method) + b" " + to_bytes(request.url) + b" HTTP/1.0\r\n\r\n"

```

With this corrected version, the `request_httprepr` function will now handle non-HTTP requests correctly by constructing a basic HTTP representation without attempting to parse the non-HTTP URL. This will allow the test `test_request_httprepr_for_non_http_request` to pass without errors.
