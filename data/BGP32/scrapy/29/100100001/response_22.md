The bug in the provided `request_httprepr` function lies in the assumption that the input requests are always HTTP requests. However, the function fails when it receives non-HTTP requests like "file" and "ftp".

To fix the bug, we should modify the `request_httprepr` function to handle non-HTTP requests gracefully without causing an error. One approach is to check the scheme of the URL in the request and handle non-HTTP requests differently.

Here is the corrected version of the `request_httprepr` function:

```python
def request_httprepr(request):
    """Return the raw HTTP representation (as bytes) of the given request.
    This is provided only for reference since it's not the actual stream of
    bytes that will be send when performing the request (that's controlled
    by Twisted).
    """
    parsed = urlparse_cached(request)
    
    if parsed.scheme in ['http', 'https']:
        path = urlunparse(('', '', parsed.path or '/', parsed.params, parsed.query, ''))
        s = to_bytes(request.method) + b" " + to_bytes(path) + b" HTTP/1.1\r\n"
        s += b"Host: " + to_bytes(parsed.hostname) + b"\r\n"
        if request.headers:
            s += request.headers.to_string() + b"\r\n"
        s += b"\r\n"
        s += request.body
    else:
        s = b''
    
    return s
```

This corrected version of the function now checks if the scheme of the URL in the request is either "http" or "https". If it is, it processes the HTTP request as before. If the scheme is anything else, it simply returns an empty byte string.

With this modification, the function will handle non-HTTP requests without throwing an error, which will allow the failing test `test_request_httprepr_for_non_http_request` to pass.
