### Analysis:
The `request_httprepr` function is supposed to return the raw HTTP representation of a given request. The function uses the `urlparse_cached` function to parse the request, constructs the path, adds the method, hostname, headers, and body to form the final HTTP representation.

### Potential error locations:
1. The function is assuming that the parsed URL always has a hostname, which might not be the case for non-HTTP URLs.
2. There may be an issue with constructing the path for non-HTTP URLs.
3. Handling of non-HTTP protocols like `ftp` might not be properly implemented.

### Bug Explanation:
The bug occurs when the `request_httprepr` function is called with non-HTTP URLs such as `file:///tmp/foo.txt` or `ftp://localhost/tmp/foo.txt`. These URLs do not have a hostname, but the function assumes that the parsed URL always has a hostname, leading to a KeyError when trying to access `parsed.hostname`.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to check if the parsed URL has a hostname before trying to access it. Additionally, we need to handle non-HTTP protocols like `ftp` properly to ensure the function works with all types of URLs.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def request_httprepr(request):
    parsed = urlparse_cached(request)
    path = urlunparse(('', '', parsed.path or '/', parsed.params, parsed.query, ''))
    s = to_bytes(request.method) + b" " + to_bytes(path) + b" HTTP/1.1\r\n"
    
    if parsed.hostname:
        s += b"Host: " + to_bytes(parsed.hostname) + b"\r\n"
    
    if request.headers:
        s += request.headers.to_string() + b"\r\n"
        
    s += b"\r\n"
    
    if request.body:
        s += request.body
    
    return s
```

With these changes, the function now checks if the parsed URL has a hostname before adding it to the raw HTTP representation. It also properly handles cases where the URL does not have a hostname. This corrected version should pass the failing test for non-HTTP URLs.
