The bug in the `request_httprepr` function is caused by assuming the request is always an HTTP request and trying to construct an HTTP request representation. This assumption leads to errors when dealing with non-HTTP requests like "file://" or "ftp://" requests.

To fix this bug:
1. Check if the scheme of the request URL is "http" before building the HTTP representation.
2. If the scheme is not "http", construct a representation that is appropriate for the specific scheme.

Here is the corrected version of the `request_httprepr` function:

```python
def request_httprepr(request):
    """Return the raw HTTP representation (as bytes) of the given request.
    This is provided only for reference since it's not the actual stream of
    bytes that will be send when performing the request (that's controlled
    by Twisted).
    """
    parsed = urlparse_cached(request)
    if parsed.scheme == 'http':
        path = urlunparse(('', '', parsed.path or '/', parsed.params, parsed.query, ''))
        s = to_bytes(request.method) + b" " + to_bytes(path) + b" HTTP/1.1\r\n"
        s += b"Host: " + to_bytes(parsed.hostname) + b"\r\n"
        if request.headers:
            s += request.headers.to_string() + b"\r\n"
    else:
        s = to_bytes(request.method) + b" " + to_bytes(parsed.path) + b" " + parsed.params + " " + parsed.query + "\r\n"
    s += b"\r\n"
    s += request.body
    return s
```

With this fix, the `request_httprepr` function will now check the scheme of the request URL and construct the appropriate representation accordingly. This corrected version should pass the failing test for non-HTTP requests.
