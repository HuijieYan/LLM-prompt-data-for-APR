The bug in the `request_httprepr` function is caused by the fact that it assumes each request passed to it will be an HTTP request. When a non-HTTP request is passed to the function, such as a `file://` or `ftp://` request, the function fails because it tries to construct an HTTP representation for those requests.

To fix this bug, we can modify the function to handle non-HTTP requests by checking the scheme of the request before constructing the HTTP representation. If the scheme is not `http`, we can simply return the request body without constructing an HTTP representation.

Here is the corrected version of the `request_httprepr` function:

```python
def request_httprepr(request):
    """Return the raw HTTP representation (as bytes) of the given request.
    This is provided only for reference since it's not the actual stream of
    bytes that will be send when performing the request (that's controlled
    by Twisted).
    """
    parsed = urlparse_cached(request)
    if parsed.scheme.lower() != 'http':
        return request.body
    path = urlunparse(('', '', parsed.path or '/', parsed.params, parsed.query, ''))
    s = to_bytes(request.method) + b" " + to_bytes(path) + b" HTTP/1.1\r\n"
    s += b"Host: " + to_bytes(parsed.hostname) + b"\r\n"
    if request.headers:
        s += request.headers.to_string() + b"\r\n"
    s += b"\r\n"
    s += request.body
    return s
```

With this correction, the `request_httprepr` function will now handle non-HTTP requests gracefully by simply returning the request body without attempting to construct an HTTP representation. This corrected version should pass the failing test provided.
