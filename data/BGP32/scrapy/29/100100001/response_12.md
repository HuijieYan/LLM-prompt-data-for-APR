The bug in the provided `request_httprepr` function is caused by the assumption that the provided URL is always an HTTP request. This assumption leads to an incorrect representation for non-HTTP requests, such as file or FTP requests. The function concatenates the method, path, hostname, headers, and body assuming it is an HTTP request, which is incorrect for non-HTTP requests.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the function to handle non-HTTP requests appropriately. We can check the scheme of the URL and handle non-HTTP requests differently. For example, for file or FTP requests, we can construct a representation that includes the scheme and the path.

Here is the corrected version of the `request_httprepr` function:

```python
def request_httprepr(request):
    """Return the raw HTTP representation (as bytes) of the given request.
    This is provided only for reference since it's not the actual stream of
    bytes that will be send when performing the request (that's controlled
    by Twisted).
    """
    parsed = urlparse_cached(request)
    
    if parsed.scheme in ['http', 'https']:
        path = urlunparse(('', '', parsed.path or '/', parsed.params, parsed.query, ''))
        s = to_bytes(request.method) + b" " + to_bytes(path) + b" HTTP/1.1\r\n"
        s += b"Host: " + to_bytes(parsed.hostname) + b"\r\n"
        if request.headers:
            s += request.headers.to_string() + b"\r\n"
        s += b"\r\n"
        s += request.body
    else:
        s = to_bytes(request.method) + b" " + to_bytes(request.url) + b" HTTP/1.1\r\n"
        s += b"\r\n"
        
    return s
```

With this correction, the `request_httprepr` function will now handle non-HTTP requests correctly by including the scheme and URL in the representation for file or FTP requests. The provided failing test should now pass when using this corrected version of the function.
