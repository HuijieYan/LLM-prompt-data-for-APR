The bug in the `request_httprepr` function is caused by assuming that the request always uses the HTTP protocol. When a non-HTTP request is passed to the function, such as a file or FTP request, the function tries to create an HTTP representation which leads to an error.

To fix this bug, we need to handle non-HTTP protocols properly by checking the scheme of the request URL before constructing the HTTP representation.

Here is the corrected version of the `request_httprepr` function:
```python
def request_httprepr(request):
    """Return the raw HTTP representation (as bytes) of the given request.
    This is provided only for reference since it's not the actual stream of
    bytes that will be send when performing the request (that's controlled
    by Twisted).
    """
    parsed = urlparse_cached(request)
    if parsed.scheme not in ["http", "https"]:
        return request.body
    path = urlunparse(('', '', parsed.path or '/', parsed.params, parsed.query, ''))
    s = to_bytes(request.method) + b" " + to_bytes(path) + b" HTTP/1.1\r\n"
    s += b"Host: " + to_bytes(parsed.hostname) + b"\r\n"
    if request.headers:
        s += request.headers.to_string() + b"\r\n"
    s += b"\r\n"
    s += request.body
    return s
```

By checking the scheme of the request URL and returning the request body directly for non-HTTP protocols, we avoid the error and ensure that the function works correctly for all types of requests.

The corrected `request_httprepr` function should now pass the failing test provided.
