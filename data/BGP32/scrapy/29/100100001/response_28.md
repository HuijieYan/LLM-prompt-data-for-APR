The bug in the `request_httprepr` function lies in the fact that it assumes the URL scheme is always `http` and attempts to parse the URL using `urlparse_cached`. This causes the function to fail when a URL with a different scheme (e.g., `file://` or `ftp://`) is provided as input.

To fix this bug, we need to make the function more generic and handle URLs with different schemes gracefully. We can modify the function to extract the necessary information (method, path, host, headers, body) from the request object directly, without relying on the `urlparse_cached` function.

Here is the corrected version of the `request_httprepr` function:

```python
def request_httprepr(request):
    """Return the raw HTTP representation (as bytes) of the given request."""
    path = "/" + request.url.lstrip("/")
    s = to_bytes(request.method) + b" " + to_bytes(path) + b" HTTP/1.1\r\n"
    host = request.headers.get(b"Host", b"localhost")
    s += b"Host: " + to_bytes(host) + b"\r\n"
    if request.headers:
        headers = b"\r\n".join([k + b": " + v for k, v in request.headers.items()])
        s += headers + b"\r\n"
    s += b"\r\n"
    if request.body:
        s += request.body
    return s
```

In this corrected version, we directly extract the URL's path, method, headers, and body from the request object provided as input, without parsing the URL. This approach ensures that the function can handle requests with different URL schemes without errors.

After applying this fix, the `test_request_httprepr_for_non_http_request` test should pass without any issues.
