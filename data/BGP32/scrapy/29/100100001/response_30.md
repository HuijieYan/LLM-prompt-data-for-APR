The issue in the buggy function `request_httprepr` arises from the fact that it assumes all requests are HTTP requests. When a non-HTTP request is passed to the function, it tries to construct an HTTP representation which leads to errors.

To fix this issue, we can add a check to see if the scheme of the URL in the request is not 'http' before trying to construct an HTTP representation. If the scheme is not 'http', we can simply return an empty byte string because constructing an HTTP representation for non-HTTP requests is not meaningful.

Here is the corrected version of the `request_httprepr` function:

```python
def request_httprepr(request):
    """Return the raw HTTP representation (as bytes) of the given request.
    This is provided only for reference since it's not the actual stream of
    bytes that will be sent when performing the request (that's controlled
    by Twisted).
    """
    parsed = urlparse_cached(request)
    
    if parsed.scheme != 'http':  # Check if the scheme is not 'http'
        return b""
        
    path = urlunparse(('', '', parsed.path or '/', parsed.params, parsed.query, ''))
    s = to_bytes(request.method) + b" " + to_bytes(path) + b" HTTP/1.1\r\n"
    s += b"Host: " + to_bytes(parsed.hostname) + b"\r\n"
    if request.headers:
        s += request.headers.to_string() + b"\r\n"
    s += b"\r\n"
    s += request.body
    return s
```

With this correction, the function will handle non-HTTP requests gracefully by returning an empty byte string instead of trying to construct an HTTP representation. This fixed version of the function should now pass the failing test provided.
