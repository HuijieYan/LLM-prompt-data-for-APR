The error in the `request_httprepr` function is caused by the `request.body` attribute being `None` when the request is a non-HTTP request. This leads to a `TypeError` when trying to concatenate `None` with bytes in the return statement of the function.

To fix this bug, we need to check if `request.body` is `None` and handle this case appropriately. One way to handle this is to convert `request.body` to an empty byte string if it is `None` before concatenating it with other bytes.

Here is the corrected version of the `request_httprepr` function:

```python
def request_httprepr(request):
    """Return the raw HTTP representation (as bytes) of the given request.
    This is provided only for reference since it's not the actual stream of
    bytes that will be sent when performing the request (that's controlled
    by Twisted).
    """
    parsed = urlparse_cached(request)
    path = urlunparse(('', '', parsed.path or '/', parsed.params, parsed.query, ''))
    s = to_bytes(request.method) + b" " + to_bytes(path) + b" HTTP/1.1\r\n"
    s += b"Host: " + to_bytes(parsed.hostname) + b"\r\n"
    if request.headers:
        s += request.headers.to_string() + b"\r\n"
    s += b"\r\n"
    if request.body is None:
        s += b""
    else:
        s += request.body
    return s
```

With this correction, the `request_httprepr` function now handles cases where `request.body` is `None` without causing a `TypeError`, and the failing test case should now pass without any errors.
