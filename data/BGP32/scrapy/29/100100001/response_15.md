The bug in the provided `request_httprepr` function is caused when generating the path for non-HTTP requests. The function assumes that it can directly use the parsed path from the request for generating the HTTP representation, which might not be accurate for non-HTTP requests.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the function to handle non-HTTP requests properly by checking the URL scheme and adjusting the path generation accordingly.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def request_httprepr(request):
    """Return the raw HTTP representation (as bytes) of the given request.
    This is provided only for reference since it's not the actual stream of
    bytes that will be send when performing the request (that's controlled
    by Twisted).
    """
    parsed = urlparse_cached(request)
    
    if parsed.scheme not in ['http', 'https']:
        path = parsed.path or '/'
    else:
        path = urlunparse(('', '', parsed.path or '/', parsed.params, parsed.query, ''))
    
    s = to_bytes(request.method) + b" " + to_bytes(path) + b" HTTP/1.1\r\n"
    s += b"Host: " + to_bytes(parsed.hostname) + b"\r\n"
    if request.headers:
        s += request.headers.to_string() + b"\r\n"
    s += b"\r\n"
    s += request.body
    return s
```

With this correction, the `request_httprepr` function should now properly handle non-HTTP requests and pass the failing test case provided.
