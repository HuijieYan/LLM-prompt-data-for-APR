The bug in the provided function `request_httprepr` is that it assumes every request passed to it will have an `http` or `https` scheme, which is not always the case. In the failing test case provided, the function is called with requests having `file` and `ftp` schemes, causing the function to fail.

To fix this bug, we need to handle cases where the scheme of the request is not `http` or `https` by modifying the function to adjust its behavior based on the scheme of the request.

Here is the corrected version of the function `request_httprepr`:
```python
# The corrected version of the buggy function
def request_httprepr(request):
    """Return the raw HTTP representation (as bytes) of the given request.
    This is provided only for reference since it's not the actual stream of
    bytes that will be send when performing the request (that's controlled
    by Twisted).
    """
    parsed = urlparse_cached(request)
    if parsed.scheme in ['http', 'https']:
        path = urlunparse(('', '', parsed.path or '/', parsed.params, parsed.query, ''))
        s = to_bytes(request.method) + b" " + to_bytes(path) + b" HTTP/1.1\r\n"
        s += b"Host: " + to_bytes(parsed.hostname) + b"\r\n"
    else:
        s = to_bytes(request.method) + b" " + to_bytes(request.url) + b" HTTP/1.1\r\n"
    if request.headers:
        s += request.headers.to_string() + b"\r\n"
    s += b"\r\n"
    s += request.body
    return s
```

With this modification, the function will now check the scheme of the request and handle cases where the scheme is not `http` or `https` differently. This corrected version of the function should now pass the failing test provided.
