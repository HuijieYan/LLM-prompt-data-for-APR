The bug in the `request_httprepr` function is caused by passing a non-HTTP request to the function, which results in a failure due to how the function is structured to handle HTTP requests only. The function assumes that the input request is an HTTP request by constructing the raw HTTP representation. When a non-HTTP request is passed, the function encounters issues with parsing and formatting the request.

A strategy to fix this bug is to modify the function to handle non-HTTP requests gracefully. This could involve checking the scheme of the request URL and adjusting the processing logic accordingly.

Here is the corrected version of the `request_httprepr` function that handles non-HTTP requests:

```python
def request_httprepr(request):
    """Return the raw HTTP representation (as bytes) of the given request.
    This is provided only for reference since it's not the actual stream of
    bytes that will be sent when performing the request (that's controlled
    by Twisted).
    """
    scheme = urlparse_cached(request).scheme
    if scheme not in ('http', 'https'):
        return b"Non-HTTP request. Cannot generate HTTP representation"
    
    parsed = urlparse_cached(request)
    path = urlunparse(('', '', parsed.path or '/', parsed.params, parsed.query, ''))
    s = to_bytes(request.method) + b" " + to_bytes(path) + b" HTTP/1.1\r\n"
    s += b"Host: " + to_bytes(parsed.hostname) + b"\r\n"
    if request.headers:
        s += request.headers.to_string() + b"\r\n"
    s += b"\r\n"
    s += request.body
    return s
```

With this corrected version, the function first checks if the scheme of the request URL is HTTP or HTTPS. If it is not, the function returns a message indicating it is a non-HTTP request. This modification ensures that the function can handle non-HTTP requests and prevents it from failing when non-HTTP requests are passed to it.
