### Analysis:
1. The `request_httprepr` function is supposed to return the raw HTTP representation of a given request, using the `urlparse_cached` function to parse the request URL.
2. The bug could potentially be in the way the `path` variable is constructed or how the `Host` header is set.
3. The failing test case `test_request_httprepr_for_non_http_request` is testing the function with non-HTTP URLs, such as `file` and `ftp`, which may cause the function to fail due to incorrect handling of non-HTTP URLs.
4. To fix the bug, we need to handle non-HTTP URLs gracefully in the function so that it does not raise any errors when processing such requests.

### Bug Fix:
```python
def request_httprepr(request):
    """Return the raw HTTP representation (as bytes) of the given request.
    This is provided only for reference since it's not the actual stream of
    bytes that will be sent when performing the request (that's controlled
    by Twisted).
    """
    parsed = urlparse_cached(request)
    if parsed.scheme not in ['http', 'https']:
        parsed = parsed._replace(scheme='http')  # Default to 'http' for non-HTTP requests
    path = urlunparse(('', '', parsed.path or '/', parsed.params, parsed.query, ''))
    s = to_bytes(request.method) + b" " + to_bytes(path) + b" HTTP/1.1\r\n"
    s += b"Host: " + to_bytes(parsed.hostname) + b"\r\n"
    if request.headers:
        s += request.headers.to_string() + b"\r\n"
    s += b"\r\n"
    s += request.body
    return s
```

By checking if the URL scheme is not 'http' or 'https', and defaulting to 'http' in such cases, we can ensure that the function can handle non-HTTP requests gracefully without raising any errors.
