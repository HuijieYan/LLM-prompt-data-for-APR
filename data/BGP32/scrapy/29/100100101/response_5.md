### Analysis
The buggy function `request_httprepr` is intended to return the raw HTTP representation of a given request. The bug in the function is related to how the `Host` header is handled when the request is not an HTTP request. In such cases, the `parsed.hostname` is used as the `Host` value, which is incorrect for non-HTTP requests.

### Bug Explanation
For non-HTTP requests (like `file://` or `ftp://`), the `parsed.hostname` should not be used as the `Host` value since these protocols do not have a hostname in the same way HTTP does. This leads to incorrect headers being generated, causing the function to fail for non-HTTP requests.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to check if the scheme of the request is `http` before determining the `Host` value. If the scheme is not `http`, we should handle it differently based on the specific requirements of non-HTTP requests like `file://` or `ftp://`.

### Corrected Function
```python
def request_httprepr(request):
    """Return the raw HTTP representation (as bytes) of the given request.
    This is provided only for reference since it's not the actual stream of
    bytes that will be send when performing the request (that's controlled
    by Twisted).
    """
    parsed = urlparse_cached(request)
    path = urlunparse(('', '', parsed.path or '/', parsed.params, parsed.query, ''))

    if parsed.scheme == 'http':
        s = to_bytes(request.method) + b" " + to_bytes(path) + b" HTTP/1.1\r\n"
        s += b"Host: " + to_bytes(parsed.hostname) + b"\r\n"
    else:
        s = to_bytes(request.method) + b" " + to_bytes(path) + b" " + to_bytes(parsed.scheme.upper()) + b"/1.0\r\n"
    
    if request.headers:
        s += request.headers.to_string() + b"\r\n"
    
    s += b"\r\n"
    s += request.body
    return s
```

The corrected function now properly handles non-HTTP requests by including the scheme in the request line and handling the `Host` value appropriately. This should now pass the failing test cases provided.
