### Explanation of the bug
The bug in the `request_httprepr` function is that it is not handling non-HTTP requests correctly. When the function receives a request with a protocol other than HTTP (e.g., file://, ftp://), it fails to construct the raw HTTP representation properly, leading to incorrect output.

In the failing test cases provided, the function is called with non-HTTP requests (`file:///tmp/foo.txt` and `ftp://localhost/tmp/foo.txt`). As a result, the function encounters issues with constructing the path and hostname in the HTTP representation, leading to incorrect byte sequences in the `s` variable.

### Bug-fixing strategy
To fix the bug in the `request_httprepr` function, we need to update the logic to handle non-HTTP requests correctly. Specifically, we should ensure that the function constructs the path and hostname appropriately for any type of request, not just HTTP.

### Corrected version of the function
```python
def request_httprepr(request):
    """Return the raw HTTP representation (as bytes) of the given request.
    This is provided only for reference since it's not the actual stream of
    bytes that will be sent when performing the request (that's controlled
    by Twisted).
    """
    parsed = urlparse_cached(request)
    if parsed.scheme:
        netloc = parsed.netloc
    else:
        netloc = parsed.path

    path = urlunparse(('', '', parsed.path or '/', parsed.params, parsed.query, ''))
    s = to_bytes(request.method) + b" " + to_bytes(path) + b" HTTP/1.1\r\n"
    s += b"Host: " + to_bytes(netloc) + b"\r\n"
    if parsed.scheme:
        s += b"Connection: close\r\n"
    if request.headers:
        s += request.headers.to_string() + b"\r\n"
    s += b"\r\n"
    s += request.body
    return s
```

By updating the `request_httprepr` function with the corrected version above, we ensure that it handles non-HTTP requests properly by constructing the path and hostname based on the request protocol (scheme). This corrected version should now pass the failing test cases provided and produce the expected raw HTTP representation for both HTTP and non-HTTP requests.
