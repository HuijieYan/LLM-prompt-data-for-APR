## Analysis
The buggy function `request_httprepr` is intended to return the raw HTTP representation of a given request. The function seems to correctly construct the HTTP request line and headers based on the input request object. However, the bug might arise from how it handles the `parsed` object returned by `urlparse_cached`. 

## Bug Explanation
The bug in the function stems from the assumption that `parsed` object always contains `hostname` attribute. In case of non-HTTP URLs like "file" or "ftp", the `hostname` attribute might be empty or not present in the `parsed` object, leading to a potential AttributeError when trying to access `parsed.hostname`.

## Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, a check needs to be introduced to handle cases where the `hostname` attribute is not present or empty in the `parsed` object. This can be achieved by checking for the existence of the `hostname` attribute before appending it to the HTTP representation.

## Corrected Version of the Function
```python
def request_httprepr(request):
    parsed = urlparse_cached(request)
    path = urlunparse(('', '', parsed.path or '/', parsed.params, parsed.query, ''))

    s = to_bytes(request.method) + b" " + to_bytes(path) + b" HTTP/1.1\r\n"
    
    if parsed.hostname:
        s += b"Host: " + to_bytes(parsed.hostname) + b"\r\n"
    
    if request.headers:
        s += request.headers.to_string() + b"\r\n"
    
    s += b"\r\n"
    s += request.body
    
    return s
```

After applying this fix, the function should now correctly handle non-HTTP URLs and avoid the AttributeError by verifying the existence of the `hostname` attribute in the `parsed` object. This corrected version should pass the failing test cases provided.
