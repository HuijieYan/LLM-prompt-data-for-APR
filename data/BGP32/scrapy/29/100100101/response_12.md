## Bug Analysis
The bug in the `request_httprepr` function is caused by an issue with handling non-HTTP URL schemes such as `file` and `ftp`. The function is assuming that the URL scheme will always be `http` and does not account for different schemes like `file` and `ftp`. This leads to incorrect parsing and construction of the HTTP representation.

## Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to update the function to handle non-HTTP URL schemes correctly. Specifically, we need to handle cases where the scheme is not `http` and adjust the construction of the HTTP representation accordingly.

## The corrected version of the function
```python
def request_httprepr(request):
    parsed = urlparse_cached(request)
    if parsed.scheme not in ["http", "https"]:
        path = urlunparse(('', '', parsed.path or '/', parsed.params, parsed.query, ''))
        host = parsed.hostname or ''
        if parsed.port:
            host += ':' + str(parsed.port)
        s = to_bytes(request.method) + b" " + to_bytes(path) + b" HTTP/1.0\r\n"
        s += b"Host: " + to_bytes(host) + b"\r\n"
        s += b"\r\n"
        s += request.body
    else:
        path = urlunparse(('', '', parsed.path or '/', parsed.params, parsed.query, ''))
        s = to_bytes(request.method) + b" " + to_bytes(path) + b" HTTP/1.1\r\n"
        s += b"Host: " + to_bytes(parsed.hostname) + b"\r\n"
        if request.headers:
            s += request.headers.to_string() + b"\r\n"
        s += b"\r\n"
        s += request.body
    return s
```

This corrected version of the function first checks if the URL scheme is not `http` or `https`. If it falls under a different scheme, it constructs the HTTP representation differently by including the host and port information. For `http` and `https` schemes, it retains the original construction logic. This modification ensures that the function can handle non-HTTP URL schemes correctly and pass the failing test cases.
