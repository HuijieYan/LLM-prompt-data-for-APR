### Fixing the bug in the function `request_httprepr`

#### Issue:
The bug in the `request_httprepr` function lies in the construction of the `Host` header for non-HTTP requests. When the request is not an HTTP request, the hostname is not being considered correctly.

#### Explanation:
The bug occurs because the original implementation assumes that the parsed URL will always have a `hostname` attribute for constructing the `Host` header. For non-HTTP requests like `file://` or `ftp://`, the `netloc` attribute should be used instead of `hostname` to correctly extract the host information.

#### Strategy for fixing the bug:
To fix the bug, we need to modify how the `Host` header is constructed for non-HTTP requests. Instead of using `parsed.hostname`, we should use `parsed.netloc` for non-HTTP requests. This change will ensure that the correct host information is included in the `Host` header for non-HTTP requests.

#### Corrected version of the `request_httprepr` function:
```python
def request_httprepr(request):
    """Return the raw HTTP representation (as bytes) of the given request.
    This is provided only for reference since it's not the actual stream of
    bytes that will be send when performing the request (that's controlled
    by Twisted).
    """
    parsed = urlparse_cached(request)
    path = urlunparse(('', '', parsed.path or '/', parsed.params, parsed.query, ''))
    if parsed.scheme == 'http' or parsed.scheme == 'https':
        s = to_bytes(request.method) + b" " + to_bytes(path) + b" HTTP/1.1\r\n"
        s += b"Host: " + to_bytes(parsed.hostname) + b"\r\n"
    else:
        s = to_bytes(request.method) + b" " + to_bytes(path) + b" HTTP/1.1\r\n"
        s += b"Host: " + to_bytes(parsed.netloc) + b"\r\n"
    if request.headers:
        s += request.headers.to_string() + b"\r\n"
    s += b"\r\n"
    s += request.body
    return s
```

By updating the `Host` header construction based on the parsed URL's scheme, the corrected function should now handle non-HTTP requests correctly and pass the failing test cases provided.
