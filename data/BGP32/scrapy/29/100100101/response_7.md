## Explanation of the bug:

The bug in the `request_httprepr` function lies in the calculation of the `path` variable. The `urlunparse` function is called with an empty string for the scheme, netloc, and params, which results in an incomplete path for non-HTTP requests. This leads to incorrect HTTP representation when generating the raw HTTP request.

## Strategy for fixing the bug:

To fix the bug, the `path` variable needs to be constructed correctly for non-HTTP requests. This can be achieved by incorporating the `parsed.scheme` and `parsed.netloc` values into the `urlunparse` call.

## The corrected version of the function:

```python
def request_httprepr(request):
    """Return the raw HTTP representation (as bytes) of the given request.
    This is provided only for reference since it's not the actual stream of
    bytes that will be send when performing the request (that's controlled
    by Twisted).
    """
    parsed = urlparse_cached(request)
    
    if parsed.scheme in ['http', 'https']:
        path = urlunparse(('', '', parsed.path or '/', parsed.params, parsed.query, ''))
    else:
        path = urlunparse((parsed.scheme, parsed.netloc, parsed.path or '/', parsed.params, parsed.query, ''))
        
    s = to_bytes(request.method) + b" " + to_bytes(path) + b" HTTP/1.1\r\n"
    s += b"Host: " + to_bytes(parsed.hostname) + b"\r\n"
    if request.headers:
        s += request.headers.to_string() + b"\r\n"
    s += b"\r\n"
    s += request.body
    return s
``` 

The corrected version of the function incorporates the `parsed.scheme` and `parsed.netloc` values into the `urlunparse` call based on whether the request is for an HTTP or non-HTTP URL. This ensures that the `path` variable is constructed correctly for both types of requests.
