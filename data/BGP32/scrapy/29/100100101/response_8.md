The issue in the buggy function `request_httprepr` stems from the fact that for non-HTTP requests, the `Host` header is not handled correctly. In the original implementation, the `Host` header was included without the `parsed.hostname` value for non-HTTP requests.

To fix this bug, we need to update the function to correctly handle non-HTTP requests by including the `parsed.hostname` value in the `Host` header when necessary.

Here is the corrected version of the `request_httprepr` function:

```python
def request_httprepr(request):
    """Return the raw HTTP representation (as bytes) of the given request.
    This is provided only for reference since it's not the actual stream of
    bytes that will be send when performing the request (that's controlled
    by Twisted).
    """
    parsed = urlparse_cached(request)
    path = urlunparse(('', '', parsed.path or '/', parsed.params, parsed.query, ''))
    s = to_bytes(request.method) + b" " + to_bytes(path) + b" HTTP/1.1\r\n"
    if parsed.scheme == 'http' or parsed.scheme == 'https':
        s += b"Host: " + to_bytes(parsed.hostname) + b"\r\n"
    if request.headers:
        s += request.headers.to_string() + b"\r\n"
    s += b"\r\n"
    s += request.body
    return s
```

With this correction, the `Host` header will now be included based on the `parsed.hostname` value for HTTP and HTTPS requests, which will resolve the issue for non-HTTP requests.

This corrected version should now pass the failing test cases provided.
