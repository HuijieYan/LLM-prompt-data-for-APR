### Analysis
The buggy function `request_httprepr` is supposed to return the raw HTTP representation of the given request. However, it fails to handle non-HTTP requests properly, as shown in the failing test case where `Request("file:///tmp/foo.txt")` and `Request("ftp://localhost/tmp/foo.txt")` are used.

The issue lies in how the function constructs the `Host` header and deals with non-HTTP URLs. The `parsed.hostname` is used to construct the `Host` header, which is not suitable for non-HTTP requests. Additionally, the path needs to be adjusted for non-HTTP URLs.

### Bug
When the function encounters a non-HTTP URL, it incorrectly constructs the `Host` header and path, leading to incorrect raw HTTP representation for non-HTTP requests.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug
1. Since non-HTTP URLs do not have a `hostname`, we should handle them differently.
2. Adjust the path construction for non-HTTP URLs to include the full URL path.
3. Update the `Host` header to handle non-HTTP requests appropriately.

### Corrected Version of the Function
```python
# The corrected version of the function
def request_httprepr(request):
    """Return the raw HTTP representation (as bytes) of the given request.
    This is provided only for reference since it's not the actual stream of
    bytes that will be send when performing the request (that's controlled
    by Twisted).
    """
    parsed = urlparse_cached(request)
    if parsed.scheme.lower() == 'http':
        path = urlunparse(('', '', parsed.path or '/', parsed.params, parsed.query, ''))
        host = parsed.hostname.encode('utf-8') if parsed.hostname else b""
    else:
        path = urlunparse(parsed)
        host = parsed.netloc.encode('utf-8') if parsed.netloc else b""
    s = to_bytes(request.method) + b" " + to_bytes(path) + b" HTTP/1.1\r\n"
    if host:
        s += b"Host: " + host + b"\r\n"
    if request.headers:
        s += request.headers.to_string() + b"\r\n"
    s += b"\r\n"
    s += request.body
    return s
```

By checking the scheme of the URL, the function now handles non-HTTP requests differently, constructs the path and Host header correctly, and provides the expected raw HTTP representation for both HTTP and non-HTTP requests.
