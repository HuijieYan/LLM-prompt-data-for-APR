The bug in the `request_httprepr` function lies in the way it constructs the HTTP representation for non-HTTP requests. It incorrectly assumes that the hostname should be included in the `Host` header, leading to a missing hostname in the case of non-HTTP requests.

To fix this bug, we need to handle non-HTTP requests differently by excluding the hostname in the `Host` header if it's a non-HTTP request. We can achieve this by checking the scheme of the URL and adjusting the construction of the `Host` header accordingly.

Here is the corrected version of the `request_httprepr` function:

```python
def request_httprepr(request):
    """Return the raw HTTP representation (as bytes) of the given request.
    This is provided only for reference since it's not the actual stream of
    bytes that will be sent when performing the request (that's controlled
    by Twisted).
    """
    parsed = urlparse_cached(request)
    path = urlunparse(('', '', parsed.path or '/', parsed.params, parsed.query, ''))
    s = to_bytes(request.method) + b" " + to_bytes(path) + b" HTTP/1.1\r\n"
    
    # Check if the scheme is 'http' or 'https' to add the hostname to the 'Host' header
    if parsed.scheme in ['http', 'https']:
        s += b"Host: " + to_bytes(parsed.hostname) + b"\r\n"
    
    if request.headers:
        s += request.headers.to_string() + b"\r\n"
    
    s += b"\r\n"
    s += request.body
    return s
```

With this updated function, we check the scheme of the URL before constructing the `Host` header. If the scheme is 'http' or 'https', we include the hostname in the `Host` header. Otherwise, the hostname is omitted from the `Host` header for non-HTTP requests.

This corrected version of the function should pass the failing test provided in the question by correctly handling non-HTTP requests.
