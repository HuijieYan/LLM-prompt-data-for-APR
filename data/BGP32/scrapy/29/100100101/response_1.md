## Bug Explanation
The bug in the `request_httprepr` function arises from the fact that for non-HTTP requests (`file://` and `ftp://`), the `Host` header is not being correctly extracted and included in the HTTP representation. This results in an incorrect output where the `Host` header is missing or incorrect.

## Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to modify the function to correctly handle non-HTTP requests by extracting the `hostname` from the `netloc` of the parsed URL.

## The corrected version of the function
```python
def request_httprepr(request):
    """Return the raw HTTP representation (as bytes) of the given request.
    This is provided only for reference since it's not the actual stream of
    bytes that will be send when performing the request (that's controlled
    by Twisted).
    """
    parsed = urlparse_cached(request)
    path = urlunparse(('', '', parsed.path or '/', parsed.params, parsed.query, ''))
    s = to_bytes(request.method) + b" " + to_bytes(path) + b" HTTP/1.1\r\n"
    
    if parsed.hostname:
        host_header = b"Host: " + to_bytes(parsed.hostname) + b"\r\n"
    else:
        host_header = b""
        
    if request.headers:
        s += request.headers.to_string() + b"\r\n"
    s += host_header
    s += b"\r\n"
    s += request.body
    return s
```

With these changes, the corrected function now correctly extracts the `hostname` from the parsed URL for non-HTTP requests and includes it in the `Host` header in the HTTP representation. This ensures that the function behaves correctly for both HTTP and non-HTTP requests.
