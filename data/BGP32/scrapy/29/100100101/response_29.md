### Analysis:
The buggy function `request_httprepr` is meant to return the raw HTTP representation of a given request. However, the function is not handling non-HTTP requests correctly as it assumes HTTP-specific elements like the Host header. This causes the function to fail when processing non-HTTP requests such as `file://` or `ftp://` URLs.

### Bug Identification:
1. The function assumes the parsed URL always has a `hostname` attribute, which is not the case for non-HTTP URLs like `file://` or `ftp://`.
2. The function constructs the HTTP request line and Host header assuming an HTTP request, which is incorrect for non-HTTP requests.

### Bug Explanation:
When processing non-HTTP requests like `file://` or `ftp://`, the function fails to handle the absence of a `hostname` attribute in the parsed URL. This leads to an AttributeError during the construction of the raw HTTP representation, causing the test to fail.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Check if the parsed URL has a `hostname` attribute before using it to avoid AttributeError.
2. Adjust the HTTP request line and Host header construction to handle non-HTTP requests appropriately.

### Corrected Function:
```python
def request_httprepr(request):
    parsed = urlparse_cached(request)
    path = urlunparse(('', '', parsed.path or '/', parsed.params, parsed.query, ''))
    s = to_bytes(request.method) + b" " + to_bytes(path) + b" HTTP/1.1\r\n"
    
    if parsed.hostname:  # Check if a hostname is present for HTTP requests
        s += b"Host: " + to_bytes(parsed.hostname) + b"\r\n"
    
    if request.headers:
        s += request.headers.to_string() + b"\r\n"
    
    s += b"\r\n"
    s += request.body
    return s
```

The corrected function checks for the presence of a `hostname` attribute in the parsed URL before using it for constructing the Host header. This modification ensures that the function can handle non-HTTP requests correctly.

The corrected function should now pass the failing test cases provided.
