### Analysis:
The buggy function `request_httprepr` is expected to return the raw HTTP representation of a given request. The function constructs the HTTP request line and headers based on the input request object. 

The failing test cases provide two scenarios where the request is not an HTTP request (file and ftp protocols). The bug in the current function is related to constructing the Host header incorrectly for non-HTTP request schemes. The bug is due to the assumption that the hostname should always be present in the parsed result, which is not true for non-HTTP schemes.

### Bug:
The bug occurs because the function assumes there will always be a hostname present in the parsed result when constructing the Host header, which is not valid for non-HTTP schemes like file and ftp. This assumption causes the function to crash when trying to access the hostname attribute in such cases.

### Fix:
To fix the bug, we need to adjust the way the Host header is constructed to handle cases where the hostname is not present in the parsed result (e.g., for non-HTTP schemes). We can modify the code to check for the presence of the hostname before adding it to the header.

### Corrected Function:
```python
def request_httprepr(request):
    parsed = urlparse_cached(request)
    path = urlunparse(('', '', parsed.path or '/', parsed.params, parsed.query, ''))
    s = to_bytes(request.method) + b" " + to_bytes(path) + b" HTTP/1.1\r\n"
    
    host_header = b""
    if parsed.hostname:
        host_header = b"Host: " + to_bytes(parsed.hostname) + b"\r\n"
    
    if request.headers:
        s += request.headers.to_string() + b"\r\n"
    s += host_header
    s += b"\r\n"
    s += request.body
    return s
```

The corrected function adds a conditional check to include the Host header only when the hostname is present in the parsed result. This modification ensures that the function can handle non-HTTP requests correctly without crashing.
