### Analysis
The buggy function `request_httprepr` is creating a raw HTTP representation of a given request, but it has a bug where it does not handle non-HTTP requests correctly. The bug occurs when parsing the hostname for non-HTTP requests, leading to incorrect output.

### Error Location
The error likely occurs in the line:
```python
s += b"Host: " + to_bytes(parsed.hostname) + b"\r\n"
```
This line assumes that `parsed` contains a `hostname` attribute for all types of requests, which is not the case for non-HTTP requests.

### Bug Explanation
When processing non-HTTP requests like `file:///tmp/foo.txt` and `ftp://localhost/tmp/foo.txt`, the `parsed` object does not have the `hostname` attribute. Therefore, trying to concatenate `parsed.hostname` with the `b"Host: "` byte string leads to an AttributeError, causing the function to fail.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug
To fix the bug, we need to handle non-HTTP requests differently by checking if `parsed` contains the `hostname` attribute before trying to use it. If `hostname` is not available, we should handle this case separately to prevent the function from failing.

### Corrected Version of the Function
```python
def request_httprepr(request):
    parsed = urlparse_cached(request)
    path = urlunparse(('', '', parsed.path or '/', parsed.params, parsed.query, ''))
    s = to_bytes(request.method) + b" " + to_bytes(path) + b" HTTP/1.1\r\n"
    
    if parsed.hostname:
        s += b"Host: " + to_bytes(parsed.hostname) + b"\r\n"
    
    if request.headers:
        s += request.headers.to_string() + b"\r\n"
    
    s += b"\r\n"
    s += request.body
    return s
```

This corrected version of the function first checks if `parsed.hostname` exists before trying to include it in the HTTP representation. This modification ensures that non-HTTP requests are handled correctly and prevents the function from failing when processing such requests.
