### BUG ANALYSIS
The buggy function `request_httprepr` is failing for non-HTTP requests because it's assuming the presence of the "hostname" attribute in the parsed URL, which is only available for HTTP/HTTPS requests, not for FTP or file protocols.

### CAUSE OF THE BUG
The bug occurs because when dealing with FTP or file URLs, the `hostname` attribute of the parsed result is empty or missing, leading to a `None` value being converted to bytes, causing the concatenation of `b"Host: "` and `b"\r\n"`, which results in `b'Host: \r\n'` in the output byte string.

### STRATEGY FOR FIXING THE BUG
We need to handle the cases where the parsed URL doesn't have a valid "hostname" attribute, providing a fallback solution for protocols other than HTTP or HTTPS.

### CORRECTED FUNCTION
```python
def request_httprepr(request):
    parsed = urlparse_cached(request)
    if parsed.scheme in ('http', 'https'):
        hostname = to_bytes(parsed.hostname) if parsed.hostname else b""
    else:
        hostname = b""

    # Constructing the path without empty or missing parts
    path = urlunparse(('', '', parsed.path or '/', parsed.params, parsed.query, ''))

    s = to_bytes(request.method) + b" " + to_bytes(path) + b" HTTP/1.1\r\n"
    s += b"Host: " + hostname + b"\r\n"
    if request.headers:
        s += request.headers.to_string() + b"\r\n"
    s += b"\r\n"
    s += request.body
    return s
```

By including the check for the scheme before accessing the `hostname` attribute, we ensure that the function now correctly handles URLs with protocols that do not have a `hostname` component. This fix should allow the function to pass the failing test cases for non-HTTP requests.
