### Fixing the bug

The bug in the `request_httprepr` function is that it assumes the presence of a `hostname` attribute in the parsed URL, which is not guaranteed for non-HTTP URLs like `ftp`. This assumption leads to an AttributeError when trying to access `parsed.hostname`.

To fix this bug, we need to handle cases where the parsed URL does not have a `hostname`. We can modify the function to check the scheme of the URL and handle the `Host` header accordingly.

Here is a corrected version of the `request_httprepr` function:

```python
def request_httprepr(request):
    """Return the raw HTTP representation (as bytes) of the given request.
    This is provided only for reference since it's not the actual stream of
    bytes that will be send when performing the request (that's controlled
    by Twisted).
    """
    parsed = urlparse_cached(request)
    path = urlunparse(('', '', parsed.path or '/', parsed.params, parsed.query, ''))
    s = to_bytes(request.method) + b" " + to_bytes(path) + b" HTTP/1.1\r\n"
    
    if parsed.scheme == 'http' or parsed.scheme == 'https':
        s += b"Host: " + to_bytes(parsed.hostname) + b"\r\n"
    
    if request.headers:
        s += request.headers.to_string() + b"\r\n"
    
    s += b"\r\n"
    s += request.body
    return s
```

With this corrected version, we check the scheme of the parsed URL and only add the `Host` header if the URL scheme is `http` or `https`. For non-HTTP URLs like `ftp`, we skip adding the `Host` header, avoiding the AttributeError. 

This corrected version should now pass the failing test cases provided.
