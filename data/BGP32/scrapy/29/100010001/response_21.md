The error message indicates that the function `to_bytes()` is being called with a `NoneType` object, which is causing the `TypeError`. This error occurs specifically at the line where `to_bytes(parsed.hostname)` is used.

The cause of this issue is that the `hostname` attribute of the parsed URL might not exist in some cases, which results in `parsed.hostname` being `None`. The `to_bytes()` function does not accept `NoneType` objects, hence causing the error.

To fix this bug, we need to handle the case where `parsed.hostname` is `None` and provide an alternative value to pass to `to_bytes()`. In this case, if `parsed.hostname` is `None`, we can default to using an empty string as the host.

Below is the corrected version of the `request_httprepr` function:

```python
def request_httprepr(request):
    """Return the raw HTTP representation (as bytes) of the given request.
    This is provided only for reference since it's not the actual stream of
    bytes that will be sent when performing the request (that's controlled
    by Twisted).
    """
    parsed = urlparse_cached(request)
    
    # Handle the case where hostname is None
    hostname = parsed.hostname if parsed.hostname else ''
    
    path = urlunparse(('', '', parsed.path or '/', parsed.params, parsed.query, ''))
    s = to_bytes(request.method) + b" " + to_bytes(path) + b" HTTP/1.1\r\n"
    s += b"Host: " + to_bytes(hostname) + b"\r\n"
    if request.headers:
        s += request.headers.to_string() + b"\r\n"
    s += b"\r\n"
    s += request.body
    return s
```

With this modification, the function will use an empty string as the host if `parsed.hostname` is `None`, which should resolve the `TypeError` and fix the bug.
