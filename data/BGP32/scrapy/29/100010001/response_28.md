### Analysis:
The error message indicates that the `to_bytes` function is receiving a `NoneType` object instead of the expected `unicode`, `str`, or `bytes` object. This is causing the `TypeError` when trying to concatenate it with other bytes objects in the `request_httprepr` function.

### Identified Issue:
The issue lies with the `parsed.hostname` attribute being `None`, which is causing the `to_bytes` function to receive a `NoneType` object.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is caused by the `parsed.hostname` returning `None` when parsing a non-HTTP request like "file:///tmp/foo.txt", as there is no hostname specified in the URL.

### Fix Strategy:
To fix this issue, we need to handle the case when `parsed.hostname` is `None` and provide a default value to avoid the `TypeError`. We can use an empty string as a placeholder for the hostname in such cases.

### Corrected Version:

```python
def request_httprepr(request):
    """Return the raw HTTP representation (as bytes) of the given request.
    This is provided only for reference since it's not the actual stream of
    bytes that will be send when performing the request (that's controlled
    by Twisted).
    """
    parsed = urlparse_cached(request)
    path = urlunparse(('', '', parsed.path or '/', parsed.params, parsed.query, ''))
    
    # Handling the case when hostname is None
    host = parsed.hostname or ''
    
    s = to_bytes(request.method) + b" " + to_bytes(path) + b" HTTP/1.1\r\n"
    s += b"Host: " + to_bytes(host) + b"\r\n"
    
    if request.headers:
        s += request.headers.to_string() + b"\r\n"
    
    s += b"\r\n"
    s += request.body
    
    return s
```

After making this correction, running the failing test should now pass without raising a `TypeError` error due to the `NoneType` issue.
