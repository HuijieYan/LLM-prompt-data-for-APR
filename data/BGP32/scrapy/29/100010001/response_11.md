### Analysis:
The error message indicates that the `to_bytes` function is receiving a `NoneType` instead of a valid string or bytes object. Specifically, the `parsed.hostname` is `None`, leading to this error.

### Bug Location:
The bug occurs at the line:
```python
s += b"Host: " + to_bytes(parsed.hostname) + b"\r\n"
```

### Cause of the Bug:
The `parsed.hostname` is `None` when the URL scheme is not "http" or "https". This causes the `to_bytes` function to receive a `None` value, leading to a `TypeError`.

### Bug Fix:
To fix this bug, we need to handle the case where `parsed.hostname` is `None` before trying to convert it to bytes. We can set a default value for `parsed.hostname` in case it is `None`.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def request_httprepr(request):
    """Return the raw HTTP representation (as bytes) of the given request.
    This is provided only for reference since it's not the actual stream of
    bytes that will be send when performing the request (that's controlled
    by Twisted).
    """
    parsed = urlparse_cached(request)
    path = urlunparse(('', '', parsed.path or '/', parsed.params, parsed.query, ''))
    
    # Handle the case when parsed.hostname is None
    hostname = parsed.hostname if parsed.hostname else ''
    
    s = to_bytes(request.method) + b" " + to_bytes(path) + b" HTTP/1.1\r\n"
    s += b"Host: " + to_bytes(hostname) + b"\r\n"
    
    if request.headers:
        s += request.headers.to_string() + b"\r\n"
    
    s += b"\r\n"
    s += request.body
    return s
```

After implementing this correction, the function should now handle scenarios where `parsed.hostname` is `None` and the corrected version should pass the failing test successfully.
