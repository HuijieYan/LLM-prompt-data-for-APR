## Analysis:
The error message indicates that the `parsed.hostname` attribute is returning a `NoneType`, leading to a `TypeError` in the `to_bytes` function. This issue occurs when the URL being passed in the `Request` object does not have a valid hostname, such as in the case of the "file:///tmp/foo.txt" URL that was used in the failing test.

## Bug Cause:
The bug in the function arises from the assumption that every URL will have a valid hostname. In cases where the URL scheme is not "http" or "https", the `parsed.hostname` attribute can be `None`, leading to the error.

## Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix this bug, we need to handle the case where the `parsed.hostname` attribute is `None`. Additionally, we should also consider handling cases where the URL scheme is not "http" or "https" to prevent such errors in the future.

## Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def request_httprepr(request):
    parsed = urlparse_cached(request)
    path = urlunparse(('', '', parsed.path or '/', parsed.params, parsed.query, ''))
    
    s = to_bytes(request.method) + b" " + to_bytes(path) + b" HTTP/1.1\r\n"
    
    if parsed.hostname:
        s += b"Host: " + to_bytes(parsed.hostname) + b"\r\n"
    
    if request.headers:
        s += request.headers.to_string() + b"\r\n"
    
    s += b"\r\n"
    s += request.body
    
    return s
```

## Explanation:
In the corrected version of the function, I added an `if parsed.hostname` check to ensure that the `Host` header is only appended if the `parsed.hostname` attribute is not `None`. This modification addresses the root cause of the bug, where the `NoneType` was causing the `TypeError` in the `to_bytes` function. With this fix, the function should now handle URLs with missing hostnames or non-"http" or "https" schemes without raising errors.
