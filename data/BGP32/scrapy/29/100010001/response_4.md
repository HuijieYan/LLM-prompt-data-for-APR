The error message indicates that the function `to_bytes` is receiving a `NoneType` object instead of the expected `unicode`, `str`, or `bytes` object. This error occurs in the line where `to_bytes(parsed.hostname)` is called. The `parsed.hostname` is being returned as `None`, causing the `to_bytes` function to throw a `TypeError`.

To fix this bug, we need to handle the case when `parsed.hostname` is `None` by providing a default value or a fallback value. One approach is to use the empty string `''` as the default value for `parsed.hostname` when it is `None`.

Here is the corrected version of the `request_httprepr` function:

```python
def request_httprepr(request):
    """Return the raw HTTP representation (as bytes) of the given request.
    This is provided only for reference since it's not the actual stream of
    bytes that will be send when performing the request (that's controlled
    by Twisted).
    """
    parsed = urlparse_cached(request)
    path = urlunparse(('', '', parsed.path or '/', parsed.params, parsed.query, ''))
    s = to_bytes(request.method) + b" " + to_bytes(path) + b" HTTP/1.1\r\n"
    
    # Check if parsed.hostname is None, use empty string as default
    hostname = parsed.hostname or ''
    s += b"Host: " + to_bytes(hostname) + b"\r\n"
    
    if request.headers:
        s += request.headers.to_string() + b"\r\n"
    s += b"\r\n"
    s += request.body
    return s

```

With this modification, the function will handle the case when `parsed.hostname` is `None`, ensuring that the `to_bytes` function does not receive a `NoneType` object. This correction should allow the function to run without errors and pass the failing test.
