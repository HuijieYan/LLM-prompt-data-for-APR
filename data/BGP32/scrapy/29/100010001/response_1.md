The error message indicates that the `parsed.hostname` is None, causing the `to_bytes` function to receive None as input, which is not supported. The `parsed` object is obtained by parsing the URL of the request using `urlparse_cached`, which may return None values for components if the URL is not in the standard format.

To fix this issue, we need to handle the case where `parsed.hostname` is None by checking its value before using it. We can replace the line causing the error with a conditional statement that checks if `parsed.hostname` is not None before concatenating it with other bytes objects.

Here is the corrected version of the `request_httprepr` function:

```python
def request_httprepr(request):
    parsed = urlparse_cached(request)
    path = urlunparse(('', '', parsed.path or '/', parsed.params, parsed.query, ''))
    s = to_bytes(request.method) + b" " + to_bytes(path) + b" HTTP/1.1\r\n"
    if parsed.hostname is not None:
        s += b"Host: " + to_bytes(parsed.hostname) + b"\r\n"
    if request.headers:
        s += request.headers.to_string() + b"\r\n"
    s += b"\r\n"
    s += request.body
    return s
```

With this modification, the function will only append the hostname to the bytes representation if `parsed.hostname` is not None, preventing the TypeError that was previously occurring.
