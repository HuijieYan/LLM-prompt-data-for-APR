### Analysis:
The error message indicates a `TypeError` within the `to_bytes` function, specifically stating that a `NoneType` object was provided instead of the expected `unicode, str, or bytes` object.

### Bug Location:
The error occurs in the line: `s += b"Host: " + to_bytes(parsed.hostname) + b"\r\n"` within the `request_httprepr` function. The `parsed.hostname` value is producing a `NoneType` object, causing the `to_bytes` function to error out.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is caused by the fact that the `parsed.hostname` attribute is `None` for non-HTTP requests like the one provided ("file:///tmp/foo.txt"). This `None` value is passed into the `to_bytes` function, which expects a valid string.

### Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to handle the case when `parsed.hostname` is `None` gracefully. We can modify the code to check if `parsed.hostname` is `None` and handle it appropriately.

### Corrected Function:
```python
def request_httprepr(request):
    """Return the raw HTTP representation (as bytes) of the given request.
    This is provided only for reference since it's not the actual stream of
    bytes that will be send when performing the request (that's controlled
    by Twisted).
    """
    parsed = urlparse_cached(request)
    path = urlunparse(('', '', parsed.path or '/', parsed.params, parsed.query, ''))
    s = to_bytes(request.method) + b" " + to_bytes(path) + b" HTTP/1.1\r\n"
    
    if parsed.hostname is not None:
        s += b"Host: " + to_bytes(parsed.hostname) + b"\r\n"
    
    if request.headers:
        s += request.headers.to_string() + b"\r\n"
    s += b"\r\n"
    s += request.body
    return s
```

By adding a conditional check to only concatenate the `Host` field if `parsed.hostname` is not `None`, we ensure that the function can handle non-HTTP requests correctly.
