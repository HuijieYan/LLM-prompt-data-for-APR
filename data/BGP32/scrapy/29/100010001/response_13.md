The issue in the provided `request_httprepr` function is that when `parsed.hostname` returns `None`, the `to_bytes` function is called with a `None` value, causing a `TypeError` because `to_bytes` function expects a unicode, str, or bytes object as input, not `NoneType`.

To fix this bug, we need to handle the case where `parsed.hostname` is `None` and convert it to an empty string before using the `to_bytes` function. We can achieve this by adding a conditional check before concatenating `parsed.hostname` in the `s` string.

Here is the corrected version of the `request_httprepr` function:

```python
def request_httprepr(request):
    """Return the raw HTTP representation (as bytes) of the given request.
    This is provided only for reference since it's not the actual stream of
    bytes that will be send when performing the request (that's controlled
    by Twisted).
    """
    parsed = urlparse_cached(request)
    path = urlunparse(('', '', parsed.path or '/', parsed.params, parsed.query, ''))
    s = to_bytes(request.method) + b" " + to_bytes(path) + b" HTTP/1.1\r\n"
    
    # Handle the case when parsed.hostname is None
    host = to_bytes(parsed.hostname) if parsed.hostname else b''
    
    s += b"Host: " + host + b"\r\n"
    
    if request.headers:
        s += request.headers.to_string() + b"\r\n"
    
    s += b"\r\n"
    s += request.body
    
    return s
```

By adding a check for `parsed.hostname` and assigning an empty bytes string if it is `None`, we ensure that the `to_bytes` function does not receive a `NoneType` value, fixing the `TypeError` issue.
