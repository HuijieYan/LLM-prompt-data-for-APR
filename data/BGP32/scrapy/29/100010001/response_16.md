### Analysis:
The error message indicates that the `to_bytes` function is receiving a `NoneType` object instead of a valid string. This is happening because `parsed.hostname` in the `request_httprepr` function is returning `None`, causing an error when trying to convert it to bytes using `to_bytes`.

### Potential Error Location:
- Line 82: `s += b"Host: " + to_bytes(parsed.hostname) + b"\r\n"`

### Cause of the Bug:
The `parsed.hostname` is returning `None`, which is not a valid input for the `to_bytes` function. This causes the `to_bytes` function to raise a `TypeError` because it expects a valid input (unicode, str, or bytes).

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
We need to check if `parsed.hostname` is `None` and handle this case properly to prevent the `TypeError` from occurring. This can be achieved by providing a default value or handling the `None` case explicitly.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def request_httprepr(request):
    """Return the raw HTTP representation (as bytes) of the given request.
    This is provided only for reference since it's not the actual stream of
    bytes that will be sent when performing the request (that's controlled
    by Twisted).
    """
    parsed = urlparse_cached(request)
    path = urlunparse(('', '', parsed.path or '/', parsed.params, parsed.query, ''))
    s = to_bytes(request.method) + b" " + to_bytes(path) + b" HTTP/1.1\r\n"
    
    # Check if parsed.hostname is None and handle it properly
    if parsed.hostname is not None:
        s += b"Host: " + to_bytes(parsed.hostname) + b"\r\n"
    
    if request.headers:
        s += request.headers.to_string() + b"\r\n"
    
    s += b"\r\n"
    s += request.body
    return s
```

By checking if `parsed.hostname` is not `None` before converting it to bytes, we can avoid the `TypeError` that was occurring previously. This corrected version should pass the failing test.
