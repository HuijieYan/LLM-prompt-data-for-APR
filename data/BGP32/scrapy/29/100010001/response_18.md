### Analysis:
The error message indicates that the function `to_bytes()` is receiving a `NoneType` object instead of the expected `unicode`, `str`, or `bytes` object. This error occurs specifically at this line:
```python
s += b"Host: " + to_bytes(parsed.hostname) + b"\r\n"
```
where `parsed.hostname` is `None`.

### Error Location:
The cause of the bug is likely due to the `parsed.hostname` being `None`, which is not handled properly when converting it to bytes using `to_bytes()`.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is caused by the fact that the `parsed.hostname` can be `None` in certain cases (e.g. for non-HTTP requests like file://). When this happens, the `to_bytes()` function throws a `TypeError` because it expects a valid string but received `None`.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix this bug, we need to handle the case when `parsed.hostname` is `None` separately. We should provide a default value or behavior for `None` values to prevent the `TypeError` from occurring.

### Corrected Function:
Here is the corrected version of the `request_httprepr()` function:

```python
def request_httprepr(request):
    """Return the raw HTTP representation (as bytes) of the given request.
    This is provided only for reference since it's not the actual stream of
    bytes that will be sent when performing the request (that's controlled
    by Twisted).
    """
    parsed = urlparse_cached(request)
    path = urlunparse(('', '', parsed.path or '/', parsed.params, parsed.query, ''))
    s = to_bytes(request.method) + b" " + to_bytes(path) + b" HTTP/1.1\r\n"
    if parsed.hostname is not None:
        s += b"Host: " + to_bytes(parsed.hostname) + b"\r\n"
    if request.headers:
        s += request.headers.to_string() + b"\r\n"
    s += b"\r\n"
    s += request.body
    return s
```

### Test:
You can test this corrected version of the function to ensure it passes the failing test.
