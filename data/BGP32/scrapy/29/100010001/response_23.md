The error message indicates that the `to_bytes` function is trying to convert a `NoneType` object to bytes, which is causing a `TypeError`. This issue is occurring specifically in the line where the `Host` header is being constructed.

To fix this bug, we need to handle the case where `parsed.hostname` might be `None`. We can check for this condition and provide a default value in case `parsed.hostname` is `None`.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def request_httprepr(request):
    """Return the raw HTTP representation (as bytes) of the given request.
    This is provided only for reference since it's not the actual stream of
    bytes that will be sent when performing the request (that's controlled
    by Twisted).
    """
    parsed = urlparse_cached(request)
    path = urlunparse(('', '', parsed.path or '/', parsed.params, parsed.query, ''))
    s = to_bytes(request.method) + b" " + to_bytes(path) + b" HTTP/1.1\r\n"
    
    # Check if parsed.hostname is None, if so, use a default value
    hostname = parsed.hostname if parsed.hostname else b'localhost'
    
    s += b"Host: " + to_bytes(hostname) + b"\r\n"
    if request.headers:
        s += request.headers.to_string() + b"\r\n"
    s += b"\r\n"
    s += request.body
    return s
```

With this correction, we are ensuring that even if `parsed.hostname` is `None`, we are using a default hostname value (`b'localhost'`). This change should resolve the `TypeError` issue and the corrected version of the function should now pass the failing test.
