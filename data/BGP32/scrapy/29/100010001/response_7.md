### Analysis:
The error message indicates a `TypeError` being raised in the `to_bytes` function. The error is occurring because the `parsed.hostname` is `None`, which is causing the `to_bytes` function to fail. The issue lies in the `urlparse_cached` function when parsing a non-HTTP URL, resulting in `None` values for `parsed.hostname`.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is caused by the `parsed.hostname` being `None` when parsing a non-HTTP URL, which causes the `to_bytes` function to fail since it expects a valid input.

### Fix Strategy:
To fix this bug, we need to account for the possibility of `parsed.hostname` being `None` when processing non-HTTP URLs. We can provide a default value for `parsed.hostname` in case it is `None` to prevent the `TypeError` from occurring.

### Corrected Function:
```python
def request_httprepr(request):
    """Return the raw HTTP representation (as bytes) of the given request.
    This is provided only for reference since it's not the actual stream of
    bytes that will be send when performing the request (that's controlled
    by Twisted).
    """
    parsed = urlparse_cached(request)
    path = urlunparse(('', '', parsed.path or '/', parsed.params, parsed.query, ''))
    hostname = parsed.hostname if parsed.hostname else b"localhost"  # Default value for hostname if it's None
    s = to_bytes(request.method) + b" " + to_bytes(path) + b" HTTP/1.1\r\n"
    s += b"Host: " + to_bytes(hostname) + b"\r\n"
    if request.headers:
        s += request.headers.to_string() + b"\r\n"
    s += b"\r\n"
    s += request.body
    return s
```

After incorporating the default value for `parsed.hostname` in case it is `None`, the corrected function should now handle non-HTTP URLs without raising a `TypeError`.
