The bug in the `request_httprepr` function is that the `parsed.hostname` value is `None` when the URL scheme is `file`. This causes an error when trying to convert it to bytes. 

To fix this issue, we need to handle the case when `parsed.hostname` is `None`. We can provide a default value for the hostname when it's `None` for non-HTTP URLs.

```python
def request_httprepr(request):
    """Return the raw HTTP representation (as bytes) of the given request.
    This is provided only for reference since it's not the actual stream of
    bytes that will be sent when performing the request (that's controlled
    by Twisted).
    """
    parsed = urlparse_cached(request)
    path = urlunparse(('', '', parsed.path or '/', parsed.params, parsed.query, ''))
    
    hostname = parsed.hostname if parsed.hostname else b'localhost'  # Fix for NoneType hostname
    s = to_bytes(request.method) + b" " + to_bytes(path) + b" HTTP/1.1\r\n"
    s += b"Host: " + to_bytes(hostname) + b"\r\n"
    
    if request.headers:
        s += request.headers.to_string() + b"\r\n"
    s += b"\r\n"
    s += request.body
    return s
```

With the provided correction, the function should now be able to handle cases where the parsed hostname is `None`, and the test should pass without any errors.
