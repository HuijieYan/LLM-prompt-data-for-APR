The error occurs because the `parsed.hostname` value is `None`, which is causing the `to_bytes` function to receive a `NoneType` object instead of a string. This leads to a `TypeError` being raised in the `to_bytes` function.

To fix this issue, we need to handle the case where the `parsed.hostname` is `None` before attempting to convert it to bytes. We can modify the code to check if `parsed.hostname` is `None` and set it to an empty string before converting it to bytes.

Here is the corrected version of the `request_httprepr` function:

```python
def request_httprepr(request):
    """Return the raw HTTP representation (as bytes) of the given request.
    This is provided only for reference since it's not the actual stream of
    bytes that will be sent when performing the request (that's controlled
    by Twisted).
    """
    parsed = urlparse_cached(request)
    path = urlunparse(('', '', parsed.path or '/', parsed.params, parsed.query, ''))
    
    # Check if parsed.hostname is None and set it to an empty string if so
    hostname = parsed.hostname or ''
    
    s = to_bytes(request.method) + b" " + to_bytes(path) + b" HTTP/1.1\r\n"
    s += b"Host: " + to_bytes(hostname) + b"\r\n"
    
    if request.headers:
        s += request.headers.to_string() + b"\r\n"
        
    s += b"\r\n"
    s += request.body
    
    return s
```

By setting `hostname = parsed.hostname or ''`, we ensure that `hostname` will always be a string, avoiding the `TypeError` when trying to convert it to bytes. This corrected function should now pass the failing test.
