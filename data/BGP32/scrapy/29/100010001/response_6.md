1. The error message indicates a `TypeError` occurring in the `to_bytes` function within the `request_httprepr` function.

2. The error is likely happening at the line where `s += b"Host: " + to_bytes(parsed.hostname) + b"\r\n"` is used to concatenate the `hostname` from the parsed URL.

3. The cause of the bug is that the `parsed` object returned from `urlparse_cached(request)` might not have a `hostname` attribute, leading to a `NoneType` being passed to the `to_bytes` function, which expects a valid string.

4. To fix the bug, we need to handle the scenario where `parsed.hostname` is `None` before passing it to the `to_bytes` function. One way to handle this is by providing a default value for the `hostname` attribute if it is `None`.

5. Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def request_httprepr(request):
    parsed = urlparse_cached(request)
    path = urlunparse(('', '', parsed.path or '/', parsed.params, parsed.query, ''))
    hostname = parsed.hostname if parsed.hostname is not None else ''
    s = to_bytes(request.method) + b" " + to_bytes(path) + b" HTTP/1.1\r\n"
    s += b"Host: " + to_bytes(hostname) + b"\r\n"
    if request.headers:
        s += request.headers.to_string() + b"\r\n"
    s += b"\r\n"
    s += request.body
    return s
```

With this correction, we are ensuring that even if the `hostname` is `None` in the parsed URL, we use an empty string instead to avoid passing `None` to the `to_bytes` function, thus fixing the `TypeError` issue.
