### Analysis:
The error message indicates a `TypeError` occurring in the `to_bytes` function call within the `request_httprepr` function. The specific error message is `TypeError: to_bytes must receive a unicode, str or bytes object, got NoneType`.

### Bug Location:
The bug is likely occurring when `parsed.hostname` is `None`. This means that the `urlparse_cached` function is not returning a valid `hostname` for the given input URL.

### Cause of the Bug:
The bug is caused by the `parsed.hostname` being `None`, which results in a `NoneType` being passed to `to_bytes`. The `to_bytes` function cannot convert a `NoneType` to bytes, hence raising a `TypeError`.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to handle the case where `parsed.hostname` is `None` and provide a default value or handle it appropriately to prevent passing a `NoneType` to `to_bytes`.

### Corrected Version:
Here is the corrected version of the `request_httprepr` function:

```python
def request_httprepr(request):
    """Return the raw HTTP representation (as bytes) of the given request.
    This is provided only for reference since it's not the actual stream of
    bytes that will be sent when performing the request (that's controlled
    by Twisted).
    """
    parsed = urlparse_cached(request)
    path = urlunparse(('', '', parsed.path or '/', parsed.params, parsed.query, ''))
    host = parsed.hostname if parsed.hostname else b"localhost"  # Provide a default value if hostname is None
    s = to_bytes(request.method) + b" " + to_bytes(path) + b" HTTP/1.1\r\n"
    s += b"Host: " + to_bytes(host) + b"\r\n"
    if request.headers:
        s += request.headers.to_string() + b"\r\n"
    s += b"\r\n"
    s += request.body
    return s
```

By providing a default value (in this case "localhost") when `parsed.hostname` is `None`, we ensure that a valid type (str or bytes) is passed to the `to_bytes` function, resolving the `TypeError` issue.
