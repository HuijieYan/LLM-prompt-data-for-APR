The error message indicates that the `parsed.hostname` value is `None`, causing the `to_bytes` function to receive a `NoneType` object instead of a string as expected. This error occurs because the `parsed` object may not have a `hostname` attribute if the URL provided does not have a hostname component, which is the case when using file:// URLs.

To fix this issue, we need to handle the case where `parsed.hostname` is `None` and provide a default value to be used in that scenario.

Here is the corrected version of the `request_httprepr` function:

```python
def request_httprepr(request):
    """Return the raw HTTP representation (as bytes) of the given request.
    This is provided only for reference since it's not the actual stream of
    bytes that will be sent when performing the request (that's controlled
    by Twisted).
    """
    parsed = urlparse_cached(request)
    path = urlunparse(('', '', parsed.path or '/', parsed.params, parsed.query, ''))
    s = to_bytes(request.method) + b" " + to_bytes(path) + b" HTTP/1.1\r\n"
    
    # Handle the case where parsed.hostname is None
    hostname = parsed.hostname if parsed.hostname else b"localhost"
    
    s += b"Host: " + to_bytes(hostname) + b"\r\n"
    
    if request.headers:
        s += request.headers.to_string() + b"\r\n"
    
    s += b"\r\n"
    s += request.body
    return s
```

By providing a default value `b"localhost"` when `parsed.hostname` is `None`, we avoid the TypeError raised by `to_bytes` function. This corrected version should now pass the failing test.
