### Analysis:
The error message indicates that the `to_bytes` function is receiving a `NoneType` object instead of a valid string or bytes object. This is causing the function to raise a `TypeError`.

### Error Location:
The error is occurring in the line:
```python
s += b"Host: " + to_bytes(parsed.hostname) + b"\r\n"
```
The `parsed.hostname` seems to be `None`, which is causing the `to_bytes` function to receive a `NoneType`.

### Cause of the Bug:
The `parsed.hostname` is `None`, which is why the `to_bytes` function is receiving a `NoneType` object instead of a valid string or bytes object. This is leading to the `TypeError` being raised.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
- Check if `parsed.hostname` is `None` before passing it to the `to_bytes` function.
- If `parsed.hostname` is `None`, provide a default value or handle the situation in a way that guarantees the `to_bytes` function receives a valid input.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def request_httprepr(request):
    """Return the raw HTTP representation (as bytes) of the given request.
    This is provided only for reference since it's not the actual stream of
    bytes that will be sent when performing the request (that's controlled
    by Twisted).
    """
    parsed = urlparse_cached(request)
    path = urlunparse(('', '', parsed.path or '/', parsed.params, parsed.query, ''))
    s = to_bytes(request.method) + b" " + to_bytes(path) + b" HTTP/1.1\r\n"
    
    if parsed.hostname is not None:
        s += b"Host: " + to_bytes(parsed.hostname) + b"\r\n"
    
    if request.headers:
        s += request.headers.to_string() + b"\r\n"
    
    s += b"\r\n"
    
    if request.body:
        s += request.body
    
    return s
```

By adding the `if parsed.hostname is not None:` check, we ensure that `parsed.hostname` is not `None` before passing it to the `to_bytes` function. This prevents the `TypeError` from occurring.
