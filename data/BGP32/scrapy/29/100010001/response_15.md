### Analysis:
The error message indicates a `TypeError` in the `to_bytes` function call within the `request_httprepr` function. Specifically, it states that the `to_bytes` function received a `NoneType` object instead of the expected `unicode`, `str`, or `bytes`. This error occurs when `parsed.hostname` is `None`.

### Bug Location:
The bug is occurring in the line:
```python
s += b"Host: " + to_bytes(parsed.hostname) + b"\r\n"
```
where `parsed.hostname` is possibly `None`, causing the `to_bytes` function to receive `None` as input.

### Cause of the Bug:
The bug is caused by the `parsed.hostname` value being `None`, which is not handled properly before passing to the `to_bytes` function. This results in the `TypeError` as described in the error message.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix this issue, we need to handle the case when `parsed.hostname` is `None` before calling the `to_bytes` function. We can modify the logic to provide a default value for `parsed.hostname` in case it is `None`.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def request_httprepr(request):
    parsed = urlparse_cached(request)
    path = urlunparse(('', '', parsed.path or '/', parsed.params, parsed.query, ''))
    
    host = to_bytes(parsed.hostname) if parsed.hostname else b""
    
    s = to_bytes(request.method) + b" " + to_bytes(path) + b" HTTP/1.1\r\n"
    s += b"Host: " + host + b"\r\n"
    
    if request.headers:
        s += request.headers.to_string() + b"\r\n"
    
    s += b"\r\n"
    s += request.body
    
    return s
```

By checking if `parsed.hostname` is `None` and providing a default value of an empty byte string `b""`, we can prevent the `TypeError` from occurring. This corrected version should address the issue and pass the failing test.
