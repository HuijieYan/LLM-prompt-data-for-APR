## Analysis:
- The error message indicates that the `parsed.hostname` within the `request_httprepr` function is `NoneType`.
- The error occurs when trying to concatenate `bytes` with `NoneType` which leads to a `TypeError`.

## Bug Cause:
- The bug occurs because `parsed.hostname` is `None` when the protocol in the `Request` object is not HTTP, resulting in `NoneType` being concatenated with the `b"Host: "` bytes.

## Correction Strategy:
- To fix the bug, we need to handle the case when `parsed.hostname` is `None`. We can replace `None` with `""` before concatenating it with `b"Host: "`.

## Corrected Version:
```python
def request_httprepr(request):
    """Return the raw HTTP representation (as bytes) of the given request.
    This is provided only for reference since it's not the actual stream of
    bytes that will be sent when performing the request (that's controlled
    by Twisted).
    """
    parsed = urlparse_cached(request)
    path = urlunparse(('', '', parsed.path or '/', parsed.params, parsed.query, ''))
    host = to_bytes(parsed.hostname) if parsed.hostname else b""
    s = to_bytes(request.method) + b" " + to_bytes(path) + b" HTTP/1.1\r\n"
    s += b"Host: " + host + b"\r\n"
    if request.headers:
        s += request.headers.to_string() + b"\r\n"
    s += b"\r\n"
    s += request.body
    return s
```

By adding conditional handling for `parsed.hostname` being `None`, we ensure that the corrected function can handle non-HTTP requests without raising a `TypeError`.
