### Analysis
1. The error message is pointing to a TypeError in the `to_bytes` function call within the `request_httprepr` function.
2. The error is caused by trying to convert a `NoneType` object (parsed.hostname) to bytes.
3. The buggy function `request_httprepr` is not handling cases where `parsed.hostname` might be `None`, leading to the error when trying to convert it to bytes.
4. To fix the bug, we need to handle the case where `parsed.hostname` might be `None` before trying to convert it to bytes.

### Fixing the Bug
To fix the bug, we can check if `parsed.hostname` is not `None` before trying to convert it to bytes. If it is `None`, we can provide a default value (like an empty string) to avoid the TypeError. Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def request_httprepr(request):
    """Return the raw HTTP representation (as bytes) of the given request.
    This is provided only for reference since it's not the actual stream of
    bytes that will be send when performing the request (that's controlled
    by Twisted).
    """
    parsed = urlparse_cached(request)
    path = urlunparse(('', '', parsed.path or '/', parsed.params, parsed.query, ''))
    s = to_bytes(request.method) + b" " + to_bytes(path) + b" HTTP/1.1\r\n"
    
    # Check if parsed.hostname is not None before converting to bytes
    if parsed.hostname is not None:
        s += b"Host: " + to_bytes(parsed.hostname) + b"\r\n"
    else:
        s += b"Host: \r\n"  # Provide a default value if hostname is None

    if request.headers:
        s += request.headers.to_string() + b"\r\n"
    s += b"\r\n"
    s += request.body
    return s
```

By checking if `parsed.hostname` is not `None` before converting to bytes, we prevent the TypeError that was previously occurring. This fix ensures that the function works correctly even when `parsed.hostname` is `None`.
