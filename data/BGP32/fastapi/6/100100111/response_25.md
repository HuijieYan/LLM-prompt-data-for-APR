### Analysis:
1. The `request_body_to_args` function is responsible for processing the received body data based on the required parameters list. It handles cases where the body may contain sequences of data.
2. The bug seems to be related to how the function processes sequences (lists, sets, tuples) in the received body.
3. The failing tests involve sending sequences in the form data and expecting them to be correctly processed into Python data structures like a list, set, or tuple.
4. The bug is related to how the function handles sequence-shaped fields from the received body data, causing issues in correctly processing the data.

### Bug Cause:
1. The bug lies in how the function processes sequence-shaped fields from the received body data.
2. In cases where sequence-shaped fields are present, the function fails to correctly handle them and populate the `values` dictionary with the appropriate Python data types like lists, sets, or tuples.
3. This leads to inconsistencies in the processed data and causes failures in the tests where the expected processed data is a specific Python data structure.

### Fix Strategy:
1. Update the logic for handling sequence-shaped fields in the received body data to ensure that the correct Python data types (list, set, tuple) are constructed and stored in the `values` dictionary.
2. This will involve identifying sequence-shaped fields correctly, extracting their values from the received body, and converting them to the appropriate Python data types.

### Corrected Version:
```python
async def request_body_to_args(
    required_params: List[ModelField],
    received_body: Optional[Union[Dict[str, Any], FormData]],
) -> Tuple[Dict[str, Any], List[ErrorWrapper]]:
    values = {}
    errors = []
    for field in required_params:
        value: Any = None
        if received_body is not None:
            if field.shape in sequence_shapes:
                if isinstance(received_body, FormData):
                    value = received_body.getlist(field.alias)
                else:
                    value = received_body.get(field.alias)
            else:
                value = received_body.get(field.alias)
        
        if value is None or (isinstance(field_info, params.Form) and value == ""):
            if field.required:
                errors.append(ErrorWrapper(MissingError(), loc=("body", field.alias)))
            else:
                values[field.name] = deepcopy(field.default)
            continue

        if field.shape in sequence_shapes:
            if field.type_ == list:
                value = value if isinstance(value, list) else [value]
            elif field.type_ == set:
                value = value if isinstance(value, set) else set([value])
            elif field.type_ == tuple:
                value = value if isinstance(value, tuple) else tuple([value])

        if isinstance(field_info, params.File) and lenient_issubclass(field.type_, bytes):
            if isinstance(value, UploadFile):
                value = await value.read()
            elif isinstance(value, sequence_types):
                value = await asyncio.gather(*[sub_value.read() for sub_value in value])
        
        v_, errors_ = field.validate(value, values, loc=("body", field.alias))
        if isinstance(errors_, ErrorWrapper):
            errors.append(errors_)
        elif isinstance(errors_, list):
            errors.extend(errors_)
        else:
            values[field.name] = v_

    return values, errors
```

This corrected version of the `request_body_to_args` function should now correctly handle sequence-shaped fields from the received body data and populate the `values` dictionary with the appropriate Python data structures, passing the failing tests and addressing the issue reported on GitHub.
