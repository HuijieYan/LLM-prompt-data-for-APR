## Analysis

1. **Bug Location**: The bug seems to be located in the section where the function decides how to extract and handle the data from the `received_body` based on the `required_params`.
   
2. **Issue**: The bug relates to parsing repeated keys in the `received_body` (e.g., `choices=parrot&choices=spider`) as a list for validation. The current implementation only uses the last key-value pair instead of collecting them as a list for validation. This causes the function to handle the input incorrectly and produce unexpected outputs.
   
3. **Potential Fix Strategy**: Modify the logic where the function extracts and processes data from `received_body` to correctly handle cases where the same key appears multiple times, aggregating their values into a list before validation.
   
4. **Expected Fix**: Adjust the code to collect multiple values for the same key in the `received_body` as a list and pass it for validation, ensuring that repeated keys are correctly handled.

## Correction

```python
async def request_body_to_args(
    required_params: List[ModelField],
    received_body: Optional[Union[Dict[str, Any], FormData]],
) -> Tuple[Dict[str, Any], List[ErrorWrapper]]:
    values = {}
    errors = []

    if required_params:
        for field in required_params:
            field_info = get_field_info(field)
            embed = getattr(field_info, "embed", None)
            
            values_list = []
            if received_body is not None:
                if field.shape in sequence_shapes and isinstance(received_body, FormData):
                    values_list = received_body.getlist(field.alias)
                else:
                    values_list.append(received_body.get(field.alias))

            # Handling multiple values for the same key
            if len(values_list) == 1:
                value = values_list[0]
            else:
                value = values_list

            if (
                value is None
                or (isinstance(field_info, params.Form) and value == "")
                or (
                    isinstance(field_info, params.Form)
                    and field.shape in sequence_shapes
                    and len(value) == 0
                )
            ):
                if field.required:
                    if PYDANTIC_1:
                        errors.append(
                            ErrorWrapper(MissingError(), loc=("body", field.alias))
                        )
                    else:
                        errors.append(ErrorWrapper(MissingError(), loc=("body", field.alias), config=BaseConfig)
                else:
                    values[field.name] = deepcopy(field.default)
                continue

            # Other validation and handling logic remains unchanged

    return values, errors
```

With this correction, the function should now properly handle cases where the same key appears multiple times in the form data, collecting their values as a list for validation. This adjustment aligns with the expected behavior described in the GitHub issue.
