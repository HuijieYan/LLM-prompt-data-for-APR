### Analysis:
- The buggy function `request_body_to_args` is responsible for converting received request body data into arguments based on required parameters.
- The bug arises when processing non-typing sequences like lists, sets, and tuples as form data.
- The bug causes the function to incorrectly handle sequence shapes and fails to correctly process input data for these cases.
- The bug leads to validation errors and incorrect assignment of values to the output dictionary.
- The provided test cases fail due to this issue, as the function fails to handle non-typing sequences properly, resulting in incorrect outputs.

### Bug Cause:
- The bug is caused by the improper handling of non-typing sequences (lists, sets, tuples) in form data processing within the `request_body_to_args` function.
- The function logic does not appropriately differentiate between single values and sequence-shaped values, leading to errors in processing and validation.
- The issue described in the GitHub post further confirms the need to support repeated keys/values in form data for proper handling of sequences.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
- To fix the bug, the function `request_body_to_args` needs to be updated to correctly handle non-typing sequences in form data.
- Specifically, the function should properly handle sequence shapes, such as lists, sets, and tuples, in the received form data.
- Ensuring that repeated keys/values in form data are collected and processed as sequences for validation is crucial for resolving the issue.
- An updated approach should accurately extract and assign values from form data while considering the sequence shapes of the required parameters.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
async def request_body_to_args(
    required_params: List[ModelField],
    received_body: Optional[Union[Dict[str, Any], FormData]],
) -> Tuple[Dict[str, Any], List[ErrorWrapper]]:
    values = {}
    errors = []
    if required_params:
        for field in required_params:
            field_info = get_field_info(field)
            embed = getattr(field_info, "embed", None)
            if len(required_params) == 1 and not embed:
                received_body = {field.alias: received_body}
            value: Any = None
            if received_body is not None:
                if field.shape in sequence_shapes and isinstance(
                    received_body, FormData
                ):
                    value = received_body.getlist(field.alias)
                else:
                    value = received_body.get(field.alias)
            if (
                value is None
                or (isinstance(field_info, params.Form) and value == "")
                or (
                    isinstance(field_info, params.Form)
                    and field.shape in sequence_shapes
                    and len(value) == 0
                )
            ):
                if field.required:
                    if PYDANTIC_1:
                        errors.append(
                            ErrorWrapper(MissingError(), loc=("body", field.alias))
                        )
                    else:
                        errors.append(
                            ErrorWrapper(
                                MissingError(),
                                loc=("body", field.alias),
                                config=BaseConfig,
                            )
                        )
                else:
                    values[field.name] = deepcopy(field.default)
                continue
            if isinstance(field_info, params.File) and lenient_issubclass(field.type_, bytes):
                if isinstance(value, UploadFile):
                    value = await value.read()
                elif isinstance(value, sequence_types):
                    awaitables = [sub_value.read() for sub_value in value]
                    contents = await asyncio.gather(*awaitables)
                    value = sequence_shape_to_type[field.shape](contents)
            v_, errors_ = field.validate(value, values, loc=("body", field.alias))
            if isinstance(errors_, ErrorWrapper):
                errors.append(errors_)
            elif isinstance(errors_, list):
                errors.extend(errors_)
            else:
                values[field.name] = v_
    return values, errors
```

### Conclusion:
- The updated `request_body_to_args` function now correctly handles non-typing sequences in form data processing.
- The fixed function should now pass the failing test cases and correctly process input data for lists, sets, and tuples as form data.
- By addressing the sequence processing and key/value collection issues, the function aligns with the expected behavior and resolves the reported GitHub issue regarding form data validation.
