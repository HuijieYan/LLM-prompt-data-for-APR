## Analysis
The buggy function `request_body_to_args` is designed to handle converting received body data into arguments based on required parameters. However, the bug in the function is related to the processing of sequence-shaped fields within form data, such as lists, sets, and tuples.

The function incorrectly handles input where multiple values with the same key are present in the form data. It only considers the last value and does not aggregate them into a list as expected.

The failing test cases provided intend to cover scenarios where a list, set, or tuple is passed as form data, but the function fails to correctly handle these cases.

## Bugs in the Code:
1. When handling forms with multiple entries for the same key, the function only considers the last entry, leading to incorrect behavior.
2. The function does not aggregate multiple entries for the same key into a list or set, causing issues with validating sequence-shaped fields.

## Bug Cause:
The bug stems from the assumption that there will be only one value corresponding to each field alias in the form data. This assumption leads to incorrect handling of sequence-shaped fields and their values in the form data.

## Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, the function should correctly handle multiple entries for the same key in the form data, aggregating them into a list, set, or tuple as required based on the field shape. This would align with the expected behavior described in the failing test cases and the GitHub issue.

## Proposed Correction:
```python
async def request_body_to_args(
    required_params: List[ModelField],
    received_body: Optional[Union[Dict[str, Any], FormData]],
) -> Tuple[Dict[str, Any], List[ErrorWrapper]]:
    values = {}
    errors = []
    
    if required_params:
        for field in required_params:
            field_info = get_field_info(field)
            value = None

            if received_body is not None:
                value = received_body.getlist(field.alias) if field.shape in sequence_shapes and isinstance(received_body, FormData) else received_body.get(field.alias)
            
            if value is None or (isinstance(field_info, params.Form) and value == "") or (isinstance(field_info, params.Form) and field.shape in sequence_shapes and len(value) == 0):
                if field.required:
                    if PYDANTIC_1:
                        errors.append(ErrorWrapper(MissingError(), loc=("body", field.alias)))
                    else:  
                        errors.append(ErrorWrapper(MissingError(), loc=("body", field.alias), config=BaseConfig))
                else:
                    values[field.name] = deepcopy(field.default)
            else:
                if field.shape in sequence_shapes and isinstance(field_info, params.File) and lenient_issubclass(field.type_, bytes):
                    value = [await sub_value.read() for sub_value in value]
                
                v_, errors_ = field.validate(value, values, loc=("body", field.alias))
                if isinstance(errors_, ErrorWrapper):
                    errors.append(errors_)
                elif isinstance(errors_, list):
                    errors.extend(errors_)
                else:
                    values[field.name] = v_

    return values, errors
```

In the corrected function, we maintain the `for` loop to iterate over all the required parameters and correctly handle each field's value aggregation from the form data. This modification aligns with the behavior expected in the failing test cases and the GitHub issue.
