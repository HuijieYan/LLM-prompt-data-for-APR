### Analysis
The buggy `request_body_to_args` function is responsible for processing the received body parameters based on the required fields. The issue arises when dealing with repeated keys in form data, as mentioned in the GitHub issue.

### Error Location
1. The loop that iterates through the required params only considers the first field for creating a dictionary with the alias as the key. This approach will not correctly handle repeated keys.
2. The way values are retrieved for each field may cause issues with handling sequences like lists, sets, and tuples.

### Bug Explanation
- The current implementation of the function does not effectively handle repeated keys in form data when mapping them to the required fields. This limitation leads to incorrect parsing of repeated values and results in validation errors or missing data.

### Bug Fix Strategy
- Modify the logic for handling repeated keys to ensure that all values are captured and stored in a list under the same key.
- Adjust the retrieval of values from the received body to properly handle different sequence shapes and file uploads.

### Bug-fixed Code
Here's the corrected version of the `request_body_to_args` function:

```python
async def request_body_to_args(
    required_params: List[ModelField],
    received_body: Optional[Union[Dict[str, Any], FormData]],
) -> Tuple[Dict[str, Any], List[ErrorWrapper]]:
    values = {}
    errors = []
    
    if received_body is None:
        received_body = {}
    elif not isinstance(received_body, dict):
        received_body = dict(received_body)

    for field in required_params:
        values[field.name] = []

        if field.alias in received_body:
            alias_values = received_body.getlist(field.alias)
            values[field.name].extend(alias_values)

            v_, errors_ = field.validate(alias_values, values, loc=("body", field.alias))
            if isinstance(errors_, ErrorWrapper):
                errors.append(errors_)
            elif isinstance(errors_, list):
                errors.extend(errors_)

    return values, errors
```

With this correction, the function will correctly handle repeated keys in form data by gathering all values under a single key and ensuring proper validation for each field.

This fix aligns with the GitHub issue's request for supporting repeated key=value pairs in form data by collecting and assigning values as lists before validation.
