## Analysis
1. The `request_body_to_args` function is designed to convert the request body parameters into a dictionary of values and a list of errors based on the required parameters and the received body.
2. The bug seems to be related to handling form data with repeated keys, which is not correctly handled in the current implementation.
3. The failing tests involve sending form data with multiple values for the same key and expecting them to be correctly processed as lists, sets, or tuples.
4. The bug is causing only the last value of a repeated key to be considered in the output, leading to incorrect parsing of form data.
5. To fix the bug, we need to modify the logic of processing form data with repeated keys to correctly create lists, sets, or tuples based on the field type.

## Bug Fix Strategy
1. When encountering repeated keys in form data, group the values under the same key into a list, set, or tuple based on the field type.
2. Update the processing logic to handle sequences like lists, sets, and tuples appropriately when multiple values are present for the same field.
3. Modify the value assignment process to correctly handle repeated keys and differentiate between single values and sequences.
4. Ensure that the error handling mechanism is not affected by the changes and errors are correctly populated for missing or invalid fields.

## Bug Fix Implementation
Here is the corrected version of the `request_body_to_args` function:

```python
async def request_body_to_args(
    required_params: List[ModelField],
    received_body: Optional[Union[Dict[str, Any], FormData]],
) -> Tuple[Dict[str, Any], List[ErrorWrapper]]:
    values = {}
    errors = []

    if received_body is not None:
        body_dict = dict(received_body)

        for field in required_params:
            value = body_dict.get(field.alias)

            if value is None or (isinstance(field_info, params.Form) and value == ""):
                if field.required:
                    errors.append(ErrorWrapper(MissingError(), loc=("body", field.alias)))
                else:
                    values[field.name] = deepcopy(field.default)
                continue

            if field.shape in sequence_shapes:
                if isinstance(value, str):
                    value = [value]
                elif not isinstance(value, list):
                    value = [value]

                if field.shape == 3 and lenient_issubclass(field.type_, set):
                    value = set(value)
                elif field.shape == 3 and lenient_issubclass(field.type_, tuple):
                    value = tuple(value)

            if isinstance(field_info, params.File) and lenient_issubclass(field.type_, bytes):
                if isinstance(value, UploadFile):
                    value = await value.read()

            v_, errors_ = field.validate(value, values, loc=("body", field.alias))

            if isinstance(errors_, ErrorWrapper):
                errors.append(errors_)
            elif isinstance(errors_, list):
                errors.extend(errors_)
            else:
                values[field.name] = v_

    return values, errors
```

In the corrected version:
- Repeated keys in form data are correctly handled by converting them into lists, sets, or tuples based on the field type.
- The logic for processing sequences in form data has been updated to ensure correct parsing of multiple values.
- The handling of missing or empty values is maintained, ensuring that required fields are properly validated.
- Error handling remains intact to capture any validation errors during the processing.

With these changes, the `request_body_to_args` function should now correctly process form data with repeated keys and generate the expected output for the provided tests.
