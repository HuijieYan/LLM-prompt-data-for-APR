### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `request_body_to_args` is responsible for extracting values from the received body based on the required parameters for a request.
2. The function loops through the required parameters, extracts the values from the received body, processes them, and validates them.
3. The bug occurs when handling sequence shapes such as lists, sets, and tuples in form data, resulting in incorrect extraction and processing of the values.

### Identified Potential Error Locations:
1. Handling of sequence shapes and form data extraction.
2. Checking for required fields and handling default values.
3. Validation of values extracted from the received body.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is caused by incorrect handling of sequence shapes in form data extraction. When processing sequence shapes like lists or sets, the function does not correctly extract the values, resulting in errors or incorrect values in the output.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Correctly handle sequence shapes in form data extraction by ensuring that values are extracted and processed appropriately.
2. Modify the logic to properly handle required fields and default values based on the extracted values.
3. Ensure that validation of values extracted from the received body is performed correctly.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
async def request_body_to_args(
    required_params: List[ModelField],
    received_body: Optional[Union[Dict[str, Any], FormData]],
) -> Tuple[Dict[str, Any], List[ErrorWrapper]]:
    values = {}
    errors = []
    
    sequence_shapes = {tuple, list, set}
    
    for field in required_params:
        value = None
        if received_body is not None:
            if isinstance(received_body, FormData):
                value = received_body.getlist(field.alias)
        
        if value is None or value == []:
            if field.required:
                errors.append(ErrorWrapper(MissingError(), loc=("body", field.alias)))
            else:
                values[field.name] = deepcopy(field.default)
        else:
            if field.type_ == set:
                value = set(value)
            elif field.type_ == tuple:
                value = tuple(value)
            
            v_, errors_ = field.validate(value, values, loc=("body", field.alias))
            if isinstance(errors_, ErrorWrapper):
                errors.append(errors_)
            elif isinstance(errors_, list):
                errors.extend(errors_)
            else:
                values[field.name] = v_

    return values, errors
```

By correcting the handling of sequence shapes in form data extraction and adjusting the processing and validation logic, the corrected version of the function should now pass the failing tests and satisfy the expected input/output values.
