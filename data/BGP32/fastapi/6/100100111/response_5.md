### Analysis
1. The buggy function `request_body_to_args` is responsible for converting the request body to arguments for FastAPI path operation functions.
2. The function receives a list of required parameters and the received body content.
3. The bug causes an issue when handling repeated keys in form data, as described in the GitHub issue.
4. The current implementation does not handle repeated keys correctly, causing only the last key=value pair to be considered.
5. The function needs to be modified to collect repeated keys and assign those values as a list before validation.

### Bug Explanation
The bug in the current implementation occurs when the function encounters a field with repeating keys in the received form data. Instead of collecting and assigning all values associated with the repeating key, the function only uses the last value. This behavior contradicts the expected handling of repeated keys, as described in the GitHub issue. As a result, the test cases where lists, sets, and tuples of repeated keys are passed fail because the function does not aggregate those values correctly.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To address the bug and support repeated keys in form data, the function needs to be updated to aggregate all values associated with the same key before proceeding with validation. This modification will align the function's behavior with the expectations outlined in the GitHub issue.

### Corrected Function
Here is the corrected version of the `request_body_to_args` function:

```python
async def request_body_to_args(
    required_params: List[ModelField],
    received_body: Optional[Union[Dict[str, Any], FormData]],
) -> Tuple[Dict[str, Any], List[ErrorWrapper]]:
    values = {}
    errors = []
    if required_params:
        for field in required_params:
            if received_body is not None:
                value: Any = None

                if field.shape in sequence_shapes and isinstance(received_body, FormData):
                    values[field.name] = received_body.getlist(field.alias)
                else:
                    values[field.name] = received_body.get(field.alias)

                if field.required and values[field.name] is None:
                    if PYDANTIC_1:
                        errors.append(ErrorWrapper(MissingError(), loc=("body", field.alias)))
                    else:
                        errors.append(ErrorWrapper(MissingError(), loc=("body", field.alias), config=BaseConfig)
                    )
                elif values[field.name] is None:
                    values[field.name] = deepcopy(field.default)
    
    return values, errors
```

By modifying the function to correctly aggregate all values associated with a repeated key from the form data, the corrected version resolves the bug and aligns with the desired behavior outlined in the GitHub issue.
