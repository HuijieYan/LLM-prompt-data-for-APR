### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `request_body_to_args` is responsible for processing required parameters and received body data, populating values and errors accordingly.
2. The bug seems to be related to handling form data when the shape of the field is a list, set, or tuple.
3. The failing test cases provided demonstrate the issue when processing lists, sets, and tuples received in form data.
4. The bug arises from incorrect handling of repeated keys in form data and the absence of proper conversion to lists, sets, or tuples for validation.

### Bug Cause:
The bug occurs due to the faulty logic in `request_body_to_args` causing the function to incorrectly handle values when the field shape is a list, set, or tuple. The function fails to process repeated keys in form data correctly and does not convert them to the expected list, set, or tuple for validation.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, the function needs to properly handle repeated keys in form data and convert them to the required list, set, or tuple before validation. This can be achieved by modifying how form data is processed for such field shapes.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
Here is the corrected version of the function that addresses the bug and supports repeated keys in form data for lists, sets, and tuples:

```python
async def request_body_to_args(
    required_params: List[ModelField],
    received_body: Optional[Union[Dict[str, Any], FormData]],
) -> Tuple[Dict[str, Any], List[ErrorWrapper]]:
    values = {}
    errors = []
    for field in required_params:
        value: Any = None
        if received_body is not None:
            if field.shape in sequence_shapes and isinstance(received_body, FormData):
                if field.alias in received_body:
                    value = received_body.getlist(field.alias)
                else:
                    value = []
            else:
                value = received_body.get(field.alias)
        if (
            value is None
            or (isinstance(field_info, params.Form) and value == "")
            or (
                isinstance(field_info, params.Form)
                and field.shape in sequence_shapes
                and len(value) == 0
            )
        ):
            if field.required:
                if PYDANTIC_1:
                    errors.append(
                        ErrorWrapper(MissingError(), loc=("body", field.alias))
                    )
                else:  # pragma: nocover
                    errors.append(
                        ErrorWrapper(  # type: ignore
                            MissingError(),
                            loc=("body", field.alias),
                            config=BaseConfig,
                        )
                    )
            else:
                values[field.name] = deepcopy(field.default)
            continue
        if isinstance(field_info, params.File) and lenient_issubclass(field.type_, bytes) and isinstance(value, UploadFile):
            value = await value.read()
        elif field.shape in sequence_shapes and isinstance(field_info, params.File) and lenient_issubclass(field.type_, bytes) and isinstance(value, sequence_types):
            awaitables = [sub_value.read() for sub_value in value]
            contents = await asyncio.gather(*awaitables)
            value = sequence_shape_to_type[field.shape](contents)
        v_, errors_ = field.validate(value, values, loc=("body", field.alias))
        if isinstance(errors_, ErrorWrapper):
            errors.append(errors_)
        elif isinstance(errors_, list):
            errors.extend(errors_)
        else:
            values[field.name] = v_
    return values, errors
```

By correcting the `request_body_to_args` function as shown above, the bug related to handling repeated keys in form data for lists, sets, and tuples should be resolved, and the function should now pass the failing test cases as described.
