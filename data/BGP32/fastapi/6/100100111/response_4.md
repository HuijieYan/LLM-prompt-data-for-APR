### Analysis:
1. The function `request_body_to_args` is designed to convert received request body data into arguments based on required parameters. It involves iterating over the required parameters, extracting values from the received body, handling special cases like file uploads, and validating the values using Pydantic.
2. The bug appears to arise when handling sequences like lists, sets, and tuples passed as form data. It fails to correctly extract and process the values of these sequences during validation.
3. The failing tests use different Python sequences passed as form data and expect them to be correctly extracted and processed.

### Bug Cause:
The bug in the current implementation arises due to incorrect processing of values for sequence shapes when they appear in the received form data. The function fails to properly handle them, leading to incorrect validation and result extraction.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Identify the areas where the current implementation fails to properly handle sequence shapes like lists, sets, and tuples.
2. Update the logic to correctly extract and process sequence values from the received form data.
3. Ensure that the extracted values are correctly validated using Pydantic and returned in the expected format.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
async def request_body_to_args(
    required_params: List[ModelField],
    received_body: Optional[Union[Dict[str, Any], FormData]], 
) -> Tuple[Dict[str, Any], List[ErrorWrapper]]:
    values = {}
    errors = []
    if required_params:
        for field in required_params:
            value: Any = None
            if received_body is not None:
                if field.shape in sequence_shapes and isinstance(
                    received_body, FormData
                ):
                    if field.alias in received_body:
                        if field.shape == 0:
                            value = set(received_body.getlist(field.alias))
                        elif field.shape == 1:
                            value = tuple(received_body.getlist(field.alias))
                        else:
                            value = received_body.getlist(field.alias)
                    else:
                        value = None
                else:
                    value = received_body.get(field.alias)
            if value is None or (
                isinstance(field_info, params.Form)
                and field.shape in sequence_shapes
                and len(value) == 0
            ):
                if field.required:
                    errors.append(
                        ErrorWrapper(MissingError(), loc=("body", field.alias))
                    )
                else:
                    values[field.name] = deepcopy(field.default)
                continue
            if (
                isinstance(field_info, params.File)
                and lenient_issubclass(field.type_, bytes)
                and isinstance(value, UploadFile)
            ):
                value = await value.read()
            v_, errors_ = field.validate(value, values, loc=("body", field.alias))
            if isinstance(errors_, ErrorWrapper):
                errors.append(errors_)
            elif isinstance(errors_, list):
                errors.extend(errors_)
            else:
                values[field.name] = v_
    return values, errors
```

The corrected version of the function includes modifications to handle sequence shapes correctly when extracting values from the received form data.

This corrected version should address the bug and pass the failing tests provided.
