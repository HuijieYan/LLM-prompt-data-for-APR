### Analyzing the buggy function

The function `request_body_to_args()` is responsible for converting received body data into arguments based on required parameters. It handles different cases based on the shape of the fields and converts values accordingly.

### Identifying potential error locations

The potential error locations in the buggy function could be related to how it handles sequence shapes like lists, sets, and tuples when extracting values from the received body data. Specifically, the handling of sequences and the structure of the `received_body` variable could be the areas causing the bug.

### Explaining the cause of the bug

The bug appears to be related to how the function handles sequences of data (like lists) in the `FormData`. In cases where the sequence shape is not recognized correctly, the values might not be extracted properly leading to incorrect validation and potentially missing data.

### Suggested strategy for fixing the bug

To fix the bug, we should ensure that the function correctly handles the extraction of sequence values from `FormData` and processes them according to the respective field shapes. This involves checking the type of the received body, extracting values based on the shape of the fields, and correctly validating the extracted values to build the result dictionary.

### Corrected version of the function

Here is a corrected version of the `request_body_to_args()` function:

```python
async def request_body_to_args(
    required_params: List[ModelField],
    received_body: Optional[Union[Dict[str, Any], FormData]],
) -> Tuple[Dict[str, Any], List[ErrorWrapper]]:
    values = {}
    errors = []
    sequence_shapes = {1, 2, 3, 4}  # Define the shapes of sequences
    sequence_type_to_type = {1: list, 2: set, 3: tuple}  # Map shape to respective type

    for field in required_params:
        field_info = get_field_info(field)
        value: Any = None

        if received_body is not None:
            if field.shape in sequence_shapes and isinstance(received_body, FormData):
                value = received_body.getlist(field.alias)
            else:
                value = received_body.get(field.alias)

        if value is None or (isinstance(field_info, params.Form) and value == "") or (
            isinstance(field_info, params.Form)
            and field.shape in sequence_shapes
            and len(value) == 0
        ):
            if field.required:
                errors.append(ErrorWrapper(MissingError(), loc=("body", field.alias))
            else:
                values[field.name] = deepcopy(field.default)
        else:
            if field.shape in sequence_shapes:
                value_type = sequence_type_to_type[field.shape]
                value = value_type(value)
            elif (
                isinstance(field_info, params.File)
                and lenient_issubclass(field.type_, bytes)
                and isinstance(value, UploadFile)
            ):
                value = await value.read()

            v_, errors_ = field.validate(value, values, loc=("body", field.alias))

            if isinstance(errors_, ErrorWrapper):
                errors.append(errors_)
            elif isinstance(errors_, list):
                errors.extend(errors_)
            else:
                values[field.name] = v_

    return values, errors
```

In this corrected version:
- Sequence shapes and their respective types are explicitly defined and used to interpret sequence values correctly.
- The function now properly handles sequence values in `FormData` and ensures correct validation based on the field information.

With this fix, the function should now correctly handle cases involving lists, sets, and tuples in the form data, resolving the issue identified in the failing test cases.
