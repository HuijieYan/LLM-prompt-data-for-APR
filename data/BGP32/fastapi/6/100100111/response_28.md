### Analysis
1. The `request_body_to_args` function is responsible for converting the received body data into arguments based on the required parameters. It handles various cases such as handling forms, files, and sequences.
2. The bug occurs in handling sequence shapes when the received body is a `FormData` object, resulting in incorrect handling of repeating keys like in the GitHub issue.
3. The bug causes the function to not correctly interpret repeated keys in form data, leading to issues in validating and processing the data.
4. To fix the bug, we need to modify the handling of repeated keys in `FormData` objects and ensure that the function correctly processes them as lists.

### Bug Fix Strategy
1. Check if the received body is a `FormData` object.
2. If it is a `FormData` object and the field shape is compatible with handling sequences, extract the values as a list for the specific field.
3. Handle repeated keys correctly to ensure that all values are captured.
4. Update the values accordingly and handle them appropriately for validation.

### Corrected Version of the Function
```python
async def request_body_to_args(
    required_params: List[ModelField],
    received_body: Optional[Union[Dict[str, Any], FormData]],
) -> Tuple[Dict[str, Any], List[ErrorWrapper]]:
    values = {}
    errors = []
    
    if received_body is not None and isinstance(received_body, FormData):
        for field in required_params:
            alias = field.alias
            
            # Check if the alias key exists multiple times in FormData
            if alias in received_body.keys():
                value = received_body.getlist(alias)
                
                # Convert values to list if multiple values exist for the same key
                if len(value) > 1 or field.shape in sequence_shapes:
                    value = list(value)
                else:
                    value = value[0]
            else:
                value = None

            v_, errors_ = field.validate(value, values, loc=("body", alias))
            
            if isinstance(errors_, ErrorWrapper):
                errors.append(errors_)
            elif isinstance(errors_, list):
                errors.extend(errors_)
            else:
                if value is not None:
                    values[field.name] = v_

    return values, errors
```

By modifying the function as outlined above, we address the issue of processing repeated keys in form data correctly. This corrected version should now pass the failing tests and align with the expected input/output values for the function.
