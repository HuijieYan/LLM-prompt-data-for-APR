### Analysis:
1. The function `request_body_to_args` is responsible for converting required parameters and received body data into a dictionary of values and a list of errors.
2. The bug seems to be related to handling repeated keys in form data, where only the last key=value pair is considered. This leads to incorrect validation when multiple values are expected.
3. The function combines all the received values for a key into a single value, which causes issues when dealing with sequence types like lists, sets, and tuples.
4. To fix the bug, a modification is needed to correctly handle repeated keys in form data and assign them as a list to the same key, as suggested in the GitHub issue.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Modify the function to check if the received value is a list and then handle it as a list for the corresponding key.
2. Implement logic to check for repeated keys in form data and consolidate them into a list before validation.
3. Update the function to correctly process repeated keys and handle sequence shapes to ensure proper validation.

### Corrected Function:
```python
async def request_body_to_args(
    required_params: List[ModelField],
    received_body: Optional[Union[Dict[str, Any], FormData]],
) -> Tuple[Dict[str, Any], List[ErrorWrapper]]:
    values = {}
    errors = []
    if required_params:
        field = required_params[0]
        field_info = get_field_info(field)
        embed = getattr(field_info, "embed", None)
        for field in required_params:
            value: Any = None
            if received_body is not None:
                if field.shape in sequence_shapes and isinstance(
                    received_body, FormData
                ):
                    if field.alias in received_body:
                        value = received_body.getlist(field.alias)
                    else:
                        value = None
                else:
                    value = received_body.get(field.alias)
            if value is None:
                if field.required:
                    if PYDANTIC_1:
                        errors.append(
                            ErrorWrapper(MissingError(), loc=("body", field.alias))
                        )
                    else:  # pragma: nocover
                        errors.append(
                            ErrorWrapper(  # type: ignore
                                MissingError(),
                                loc=("body", field.alias),
                                config=BaseConfig,
                            )
                        )
                else:
                    values[field.name] = deepcopy(field.default)
                continue
            if (
                isinstance(field_info, params.File)
                and lenient_issubclass(field.type_, bytes)
                and isinstance(value, UploadFile)
            ):
                value = await value.read()
            elif (
                field.shape in sequence_shapes
                and isinstance(field_info, params.File)
                and lenient_issubclass(field.type_, bytes)
                and isinstance(value, sequence_types)
            ):
                awaitables = [sub_value.read() for sub_value in value]
                contents = await asyncio.gather(*awaitables)
                value = sequence_shape_to_type[field.shape](contents)
            v_, errors_ = field.validate(value, values, loc=("body", field.alias))
            if isinstance(errors_, ErrorWrapper):
                errors.append(errors_)
            elif isinstance(errors_, list):
                errors.extend(errors_)
            else:
                values[field.name] = v_
    return values, errors
```

### Correction Rationale:
1. Updated the function to correctly handle repeated keys in form data by checking if the received value is a list.
2. Added logic to handle repeated keys as a list under the same key for validation.
3. Ensured that the function appropriately processes sequence shapes and handles validation based on the received data.
4. The corrected function should now handle sequence types like lists, sets, and tuples correctly, resolving the bug in processing repeated keys in form data. This change aligns with the suggested solution in the GitHub issue.
