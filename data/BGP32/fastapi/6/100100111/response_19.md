### Analysis:
The buggy function `request_body_to_args` is responsible for converting request body data to arguments based on the required parameters defined in the function input. The bug lies in handling sequence-shaped fields like lists, sets, and tuples correctly. The current implementation only considers the last value of a repeated key in form data. This behavior is not aligned with the expected behavior described in the GitHub issue, which requires collecting repeated keys and assigning them as a list.

### Error Locations:
1. The condition to check if the field shape is a sequence shape (`field.shape in sequence_shapes`) is problematic.
2. When checking for sequences of files, the logic to read sub-values should be adjusted.

### Bug Cause:
The bug causes the function to only consider the last value of a repeated key in form data, leading to incorrect data processing and validation for sequence-shaped fields. This behavior is not aligned with the expected behavior required in the GitHub issue.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
1. Modify the logic to correctly handle sequence-shaped fields by collecting all values for a repeated key as a list.
2. Adjust the logic for reading sub-values in sequence-shaped file fields to ensure correct handling.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
from typing import Dict, Any, List

async def request_body_to_args(
    required_params: List[ModelField],
    received_body: Optional[Union[Dict[str, Any], FormData]],
) -> Tuple[Dict[str, Any], List[ErrorWrapper]]:
    values = {}
    errors = []
    if required_params:
        field = required_params[0]
        field_info = get_field_info(field)
        embed = getattr(field_info, "embed", None)
        if len(required_params) == 1 and not embed:
            received_body = {field.alias: received_body}

        for field in required_params:
            value: Any = None
            if received_body is not None:
                if field.shape in sequence_shapes and isinstance(
                    received_body, FormData
                ):
                    if field.alias in received_body:
                        value = received_body.getlist(field.alias)
                else:

                    and len(value) == 0

            ):
                if field.required:
                    if PYDANTIC_1:
                        errors.append(
                            ErrorWrapper(MissingError(), loc=("body", field.alias))
                        )
                    else:  # pragma: nocover
                        errors.append(
                            ErrorWrapper(  # type: ignore
                                MissingError(),

                                config=BaseConfig,
                            )
                        )
                else:
                    values[field.name] = deepcopy(field.default)
                continue

            if (
                isinstance(field_info, params.File)
                and lenient_issubclass(field.type_, bytes)
                and isinstance(value, UploadFile)
            ):
                value = await value.read()
            elif (
                field.shape in sequence_shapes
                and isinstance(field_info, params.File)
                and lenient_issubclass(field.type_, bytes)
                and isinstance(value, list)
            ):
                awaitables = [sub_value.read() for sub_value in value]
                contents = await asyncio.gather(*awaitables)
                value = sequence_shape_to_type[field.shape](contents)

            v_, errors_ = field.validate(value, values, loc=("body", field.alias))
            if isinstance(errors_, ErrorWrapper):
                errors.append(errors_)
            elif isinstance(errors_, list):
                errors.extend(errors_)
            else:
                values[field.name] = v_

    return values, errors
```

### Summary:
The corrected version of the `request_body_to_args` function has been updated to handle sequence-shaped fields correctly as requested in the GitHub issue. The function should now pass the failing tests and correctly process repeated key data in form requests.
