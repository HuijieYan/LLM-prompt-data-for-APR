### Analysis
- The `request_body_to_args` function is responsible for extracting values from a request body and converting them based on the provided field information.
- The function has logic to handle values from form data by checking the shape of the field and processing the values accordingly.
- The bug seems to be related to how the function handles the conversion of non-typing sequences (list, set, tuple) from form data.
- The failing tests provide scenarios where the function fails to correctly extract values from form data for list, set, and tuple types.
- The GitHub issue also mentions the specific problem of supporting repeated key=value pairs in form data.

### Potential Error Locations
- Handling of non-typing sequences in the form data conversion logic.
- Incorrect manipulation of received data based on the field shape.
- Validation and extraction of values may not handle repeated keys properly.

### Bug Cause
The bug arises from how the function processes non-typing sequences (list, set, tuple) from form data. It fails to correctly interpret and convert these values leading to incorrect results. The function does not handle the repeated keys in form data properly, as mentioned in the GitHub issue.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, the function `request_body_to_args` needs to be adjusted to correctly handle non-typing sequences in form data. It should also account for repeated key=value pairs in form data and convert them to lists for validation.

### Corrected Version
Here is the corrected version of the `request_body_to_args` function:

```python
async def request_body_to_args(
    required_params: List[ModelField],
    received_body: Optional[Union[Dict[str, Any], FormData]],
) -> Tuple[Dict[str, Any], List[ErrorWrapper]]:
    values = {}
    errors = []
    if required_params:
        for field in required_params:
            value: Any = None
            if received_body is not None:
                if field.shape in sequence_shapes and isinstance(received_body, FormData):
                    if field.alias in received_body.keys():
                        if field.shape == 0:
                            value = received_body.getlist(field.alias)
                        else:
                            value = received_body.get(field.alias)
            if (
                value is None
                or (isinstance(field_info, params.Form) and value == "")
            ):
                if field.required:
                    if PYDANTIC_1:
                        errors.append(
                            ErrorWrapper(MissingError(), loc=("body", field.alias))
                        )
                    else:  # pragma: nocover
                        errors.append(
                            ErrorWrapper(MissingError(), loc=("body", field.alias), config=BaseConfig)
                        )
                else:
                    values[field.name] = deepcopy(field.default)
                continue
            
            v_, errors_ = field.validate(value, values, loc=("body", field.alias))
            if isinstance(errors_, ErrorWrapper):
                errors.append(errors_)
            elif isinstance(errors_, list):
                errors.extend(errors_)
            else:
                values[field.name] = v_
    return values, errors
```

This corrected version addresses the issues related to handling non-typing sequences and ensures correct extraction and conversion of values from form data. It also accounts for repeated key=value pairs in form data.
