### Error Analysis:

The buggy function `request_body_to_args` is causing issues due to its handling of multiple values for the same key in the `received_body` FormData. It fails to correctly process multiple values with the same key, leading to only the last value being considered, which is not the expected behavior as mentioned in the GitHub issue.

1. The current implementation only handles one key-value pair per field when `received_body` is a FormData and does not handle repeated keys for the same field.
2. As a result, when multiple values are passed for the same key in FormData, only the last value is considered and processed, leading to validation errors.

### Bug Fix Strategy:

To address the bug and support repeated key-value pairs in FormData, the function should be modified to handle multiple values for the same field correctly. A possible approach is to update the logic to aggregate all values for a field key into a list and then process them accordingly.

### Bug Fix Solution:

Here is the corrected version of the `request_body_to_args` function that addresses the bug:

```python
async def request_body_to_args(
    required_params: List[ModelField],
    received_body: Optional[Union[Dict[str, Any], FormData]],
) -> Tuple[Dict[str, Any], List[ErrorWrapper]]:
    values = {}
    errors = []
    if required_params:
        for field in required_params:
            value: Any = None
            if received_body is not None:
                if field.shape in sequence_shapes and isinstance(
                    received_body, FormData
                ):
                    values_list = received_body.getlist(field.alias)
                    if len(values_list) == 1:
                        value = values_list[0]
                    else:
                        value = values_list
                else:
                    in_val = received_body.get(field.alias)
                    if isinstance(in_val, list):
                        value = in_val
                    else:
                        value = [in_val]
            if value is not None:
                ...
                
                # Remaining validation code remains the same

    return values, errors
```

In this corrected version, the function now correctly handles cases where multiple values are provided for the same field key in FormData. It aggregates all values into a list for that field key, allowing proper processing during validation.
