### Bug Analysis and Explanation:
The bug in the `request_body_to_args` function lies in how it handles multiple values for a single field when processing `FormData` objects. The code does not properly consider scenarios where the same key appears multiple times in the `FormData`. Instead of collecting all values for a field and converting them to a list, it only assigns the last value encountered, leading to validation errors in cases where multiple values are present.

### Bug Location:
The issue occurs in the block of code where the function processes the values from `FormData` for each field. When encountering a field with multiple values (e.g., 'items'), the function should collect all values into a list rather than simply assigning the last value.

### Cause of the Bug:
The bug arises from the assumption that each field in the `FormData` dictionary will have a single value, leading to the incorrect handling of repeated keys. This assumption causes validation errors when fields with multiple values are encountered, as evident from the failing test cases provided.

### Fix Strategy:
To resolve the bug and address the GitHub issue related to handling repeated key-value pairs in `FormData`, the function should be modified to correctly collect all values for a field into a list when processing `FormData`. This adjustment ensures that fields with multiple values are properly handled and validated.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
Here is the corrected version of the `request_body_to_args` function:

```python
async def request_body_to_args(
    required_params: List[ModelField],
    received_body: Optional[Union[Dict[str, Any], FormData]],
) -> Tuple[Dict[str, Any], List[ErrorWrapper]]:
    values = {}
    errors = []
    if required_params:
        for field in required_params:
            value: Any = None
            if received_body is not None:
                if field.shape in sequence_shapes and isinstance(
                    received_body, FormData
                ):
                    value = received_body.getlist(field.alias)
                else:
                    value = received_body.getlist(field.alias) if field.alias in received_body else None
            if value is None or (field.required and len(value) == 0):
                if field.required:
                    errors.append(
                        ErrorWrapper(MissingError(), loc=("body", field.alias))
                    )
                else:
                    values[field.name] = deepcopy(field.default)
                continue
            if (
                isinstance(field_info, params.File)
                and lenient_issubclass(field.type_, bytes)
                and all(isinstance(v, UploadFile) for v in value)
            ):
                value = [await v.read() for v in value]
            v_, errors_ = field.validate(value, values, loc=("body", field.alias))
            if isinstance(errors_, ErrorWrapper):
                errors.append(errors_)
            elif isinstance(errors_, list):
                errors.extend(errors_)
            else:
                values[field.name] = v_
    return values, errors
```

Please test the corrected version with the provided failing test cases and check if the original issue as described in the GitHub report is resolved. The updated function should now handle repeated key-value pairs in `FormData` properly and address the validation errors related to fields with multiple values.
