### Analysis
- The function `request_body_to_args` aims to convert the received body data into arguments based on the required parameters.
- It iterates through the required parameters and extracts values from the received body data, validating and processing them.
- The bug seems to stem from how the function handles sequence shapes (`list`, `set`, `tuple`) and multiple values for the same key in the received body data.
- The identified bug prevents the correct extraction and handling of multiple values when a key appears multiple times in the `FormData`.

### Bug Cause
1. When a key appears multiple times in the `FormData`, the function only considers the last value for that key due to the current handling logic.
2. The code is not structured to gather all values for a key and process them as a list, set, or tuple based on the field's type definition.
3. This leads to incorrect validation and processing of repeated keys in the received body data, impacting the correctness and completeness of the extracted values.

### Bug Fix Strategy
1. Adjust the logic to collect all values corresponding to the same key in the `FormData` and process them as a unified list, set, or tuple depending on the type of the field.
2. Update the logic to handle different sequence shapes correctly and ensure that all values for a key are considered during validation and processing.

### Correction

```python
async def request_body_to_args(
    required_params: List[ModelField],
    received_body: Optional[Union[Dict[str, Any], FormData]],
) -> Tuple[Dict[str, Any], List[ErrorWrapper]]:
    values = {}
    errors = []
    for field in required_params:
        value = None
        if received_body is not None:
            if field.shape in sequence_shapes and isinstance(received_body, FormData):
                all_values = received_body.getlist(field.alias)
                if field.shape == sequence_types["list"]:
                    value = all_values
                elif field.shape == sequence_types["set"]:
                    value = set(all_values)
                elif field.shape == sequence_types["tuple"]:
                    value = tuple(all_values)
            else:
                value = received_body.get(field.alias)
        if (
            value is None
            or (isinstance(field_info, params.Form) and value == "")
            or (
                isinstance(field_info, params.Form)
                and field.shape in sequence_shapes
                and len(value) == 0
            )
        ):
            if field.required:
                errors.append(ErrorWrapper(MissingError(), loc=("body", field.alias))
            else:
                values[field.name] = deepcopy(field.default)
            continue
        v_, errors_ = field.validate(value, values, loc=("body", field.alias))
        if isinstance(errors_, ErrorWrapper):
            errors.append(errors_)
        elif isinstance(errors_, list):
            errors.extend(errors_)
        else:
            values[field.name] = v_
    return values, errors
```

### Correction Rationale
- The corrected version now correctly handles multiple values for the same key in the received body data.
- It collects all values corresponding to a key in a list, set, or tuple based on the field's sequence shape.
- The logic ensures that all values for a key are considered during validation and processing, aligning with the expected behavior based on the identified issue.
- The function now accurately extracts and processes data from the received body, addressing the bug related to repeated keys in the form data.
