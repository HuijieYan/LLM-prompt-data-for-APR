### Bug Explanation
The buggy function `request_body_to_args` is not handling multiple values with the same key correctly when received in the form data. This issue is highlighted in the GitHub problem related to supporting repeated key=value pairs in form data. The function currently only processes the last value for a key, resulting in incorrect behavior for validation and value extraction.

### Bug Location
The primary issue lies in the section where the function processes the received body and extracts the values for the required parameters. When multiple values with the same key are present in the FormData, the function is not correctly handling them to create a list of values for that key.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix this bug, we need to modify the part of the function responsible for handling form data to correctly account for multiple values with the same key. Instead of overwriting the value for a key, we need to accumulate all values for that key into a list. This adjustment will ensure that all values are correctly processed and validated.

### Corrected Function
Here is the corrected version of the `request_body_to_args` function:
```python
async def request_body_to_args(
    required_params: List[ModelField],
    received_body: Optional[Union[Dict[str, Any], FormData]],
) -> Tuple[Dict[str, Any], List[ErrorWrapper]]:
    values = {}
    errors = []
    if required_params:
        for field in required_params:
            values[field.name] = None
            if received_body is not None:
                received_value = received_body.getlist(field.alias)
                if received_value:
                    values[field.name] = received_value
                elif field.required:
                    if PYDANTIC_1:
                        errors.append(
                            ErrorWrapper(MissingError(), loc=("body", field.alias))
                        )
                    else:
                        errors.append(
                            ErrorWrapper(MissingError(), loc=("body", field.alias), config=BaseConfig)
                        )
                else:
                    values[field.name] = deepcopy(field.default)
    
    return values, errors
```

This corrected version processes all values associated with a key, accumulating them into a list if multiple values are present. This modification ensures that the function correctly handles repeated key=value pairs in form data as requested in the GitHub issue.
