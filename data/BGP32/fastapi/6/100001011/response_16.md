### Analysis:
The buggy function `request_body_to_args` is designed to convert the request body to arguments based on the required parameters and received body. However, the function has a bug that causes issues with processing repeated key-value pairs in form data.

#### Identified Issues:
1. The function does not properly handle scenarios where a field may have multiple values (repeated key-value pairs) in the received body.
2. In the case of repeated key-value pairs for a field, the function only considers the last value which conflicts with the expectation of collecting all values as a list for the same key.
3. The validation and assignment of repeated key-value pairs to a list for the same key are missing, leading to incorrect behavior.

### Cause of the Bug:
The bug in the function can be attributed to the assumption that a field in the request body will have a single value, leading to the overwrite of previous values in the case of repeated key-value pairs. This behavior does not align with the expectation of collecting all values for the same key.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To resolve the bug and align with the feature request on the GitHub issue, the function needs to be updated to correctly handle repeated key-value pairs in form data. Specifically:
- Modify the logic to collect all values for a field with repeated key-value pairs as a list.
- Update validation and assignment mechanisms to handle list values for the same field.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
async def request_body_to_args(
    required_params: List[ModelField],
    received_body: Optional[Union[Dict[str, Any], FormData]],
) -> Tuple[Dict[str, Any], List[ErrorWrapper]]:
    values = {}
    errors = []
    
    if required_params:
        for field in required_params:
            value: Any = None
            if received_body is not None:
                if field.shape in sequence_shapes and isinstance(
                    received_body, FormData
                ):
                    values_list = received_body.getlist(field.alias)
                    if len(values_list) == 1:
                        value = values_list[0]
                    else:
                        value = values_list
                else:
                    value = received_body.get(field.alias)
            
            if value is None or (
                isinstance(field_info, params.Form)
                and field.shape in sequence_shapes
                and len(value) == 0
            ):
                if field.required:
                    if PYDANTIC_1:
                        errors.append(
                            ErrorWrapper(MissingError(), loc=("body", field.alias))
                        )
                    else:
                        errors.append(
                            ErrorWrapper(
                                MissingError(),
                                loc=("body", field.alias),
                                config=BaseConfig,
                            )
                        )
                else:
                    values[field.name] = deepcopy(field.default)
                continue
            
            if (
                isinstance(field_info, params.File)
                and lenient_issubclass(field.type_, bytes)
                and isinstance(value, UploadFile)
            ):
                value = await value.read()
            
            v_, errors_ = field.validate(value, values, loc=("body", field.alias))
            
            if isinstance(errors_, ErrorWrapper):
                errors.append(errors_)
            elif isinstance(errors_, list):
                errors.extend(errors_)
            else:
                values[field.name] = v_
    
    return values, errors
```

### Changes Made:
1. Added logic to check if the received body is a `FormData` and handle gathering values as a list for repeated key-value pairs.
2. Updated the validation step to handle list values properly and assign them as a list for the same field.
3. Revamped the processing of values to align with the expected behavior of collecting all values for the same key.

By implementing these changes, the corrected function should now address the bug and correctly handle repeated key-value pairs in form data as stated in the GitHub issue.
