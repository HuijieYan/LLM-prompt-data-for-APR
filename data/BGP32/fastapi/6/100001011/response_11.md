### Analysis:
The buggy function `request_body_to_args` is designed to extract and validate values from the received body based on the required parameters. However, it seems to be handling the scenario of multiple values associated with the same key (like in form data) incorrectly. This issue is directly related to the GitHub issue, where the expectation is that repeated keys in form data should be collected and stored as a list for validation.

### Identified Bug:
The bug lies in how the function handles repeated keys in form data. It currently only considers the last value associated with a key for validation, leading to inaccurate validation results when dealing with multiple values for a single key.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To address the bug, we need to modify the function's logic to appropriately handle repeated keys in form data. Instead of replacing the value associated with a key, we should aggregate all values belonging to the same key into a list for validation.

### Bug Fix (Corrected Version of the Function):
```python
async def request_body_to_args(
    required_params: List[ModelField],
    received_body: Optional[Union[Dict[str, Any], FormData]],
) -> Tuple[Dict[str, Any], List[ErrorWrapper]]:
    values = {}
    errors = []
    if required_params:
        for field in required_params:
            value: Any = None
            if received_body is not None:
                if field.shape in sequence_shapes and isinstance(received_body, FormData):
                    if field.alias in received_body.keys():
                        value = received_body.getlist(field.alias)  # Change this line
                    else:
                        value = []
                else:
                    value = received_body.get(field.alias) if field.alias in received_body.keys() else None  # Change this line
            if value is None or (isinstance(field_info, params.Form) and value == "") or (
                isinstance(field_info, params.Form) and field.shape in sequence_shapes and len(value) == 0
            ):
                if field.required:
                    if PYDANTIC_1:
                        errors.append(ErrorWrapper(MissingError(), loc=("body", field.alias)))
                    else:  # pragma: nocover
                        errors.append(ErrorWrapper(MissingError(), loc=("body", field.alias), config=BaseConfig))
                else:
                    values[field.name] = deepcopy(field.default)
                continue
            if isinstance(field_info, params.File) and lenient_issubclass(field.type_, bytes) and isinstance(value, UploadFile):
                value = await value.read()
            elif field.shape in sequence_shapes and isinstance(field_info, params.File) and lenient_issubclass(field.type_, bytes) and isinstance(value, sequence_types):
                awaitables = [sub_value.read() for sub_value in value]
                contents = await asyncio.gather(*awaitables)
                value = sequence_shape_to_type[field.shape](contents)
            v_, errors_ = field.validate(value, values, loc=("body", field.alias))
            if isinstance(errors_, ErrorWrapper):
                errors.append(errors_)
            elif isinstance(errors_, list):
                errors.extend(errors_)
            else:
                values[field.name] = v_
    return values, errors
```

The corrected version of the function addresses the issue by correctly handling repeated keys in the form data. It now aggregates multiple values associated with the same key into a list for proper validation, aligning with the expected behavior stated in the GitHub issue.
