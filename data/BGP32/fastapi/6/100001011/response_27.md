### Bug Explanation
The bug in the `request_body_to_args` function arises from the handling of repeated keys in the `FormData`. When receiving FormData with repeated keys, the function currently only considers the last value instead of collecting all values into a list for validation. This behavior is not aligned with the feature request presented in the GitHub issue, which suggests aggregating repeated keys into a list.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix this issue, the function needs to be modified to handle repeated keys in FormData correctly. We should update the logic to collect all values for a repeated key into a list before validation.

### Corrected Version of the Function
Here is the corrected version of the `request_body_to_args` function that addresses the bug and aligns with the GitHub issue's feature request:

```python
async def request_body_to_args(
    required_params: List[ModelField],
    received_body: Optional[Union[Dict[str, Any], FormData]],
) -> Tuple[Dict[str, Any], List[ErrorWrapper]]:
    values = {}
    errors = []
    if required_params:
        if received_body is not None and isinstance(received_body, FormData):
            for field in required_params:
                values[field.name] = []
                for key, value in received_body.items():
                    if field.alias == key:
                        values[field.name].append(value)
                if not values[field.name] and field.required:
                    errors.append(
                        ErrorWrapper(MissingError(), loc=("body", field.alias))
                    )
        else:
            # Handle the case when received_body is not FormData
            for field in required_params:
                if field.required:
                    errors.append(
                        ErrorWrapper(MissingError(), loc=("body", field.alias))
                    )
                else:
                    values[field.name] = deepcopy(field.default)
    return values, errors
```

This corrected version ensures that all values for a repeated key in FormData are collected into a list, allowing validation against a list of values for the same key.
