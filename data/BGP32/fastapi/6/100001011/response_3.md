### Analysis
The buggy function `request_body_to_args` is responsible for converting the received body parameters into arguments compatible with required parameters in a request. The issue reported on GitHub highlights the problem with repeated keys in form data, where only the last key-value pair is considered. This causes issues with validation against multiple values, especially when expecting lists.

### Error Locations
1. The logic to handle repeated keys in form data is missing.
2. Validation against multiple values is not correctly implemented.
3. Error handling for missing values is causing issues with validation errors.

### Bug Cause
The bug arises from the insufficient handling of repeated keys in form data. The function processes the input data based on a singular key-value approach, causing validation errors when multiple values are expected for a single key. This inconsistency in handling form data leads to incorrect validations and error reporting.

### Fix Strategy
To address the bug, the function needs to be modified to aggregate and process repeated keys in form data correctly. By updating the logic to handle multiple values for a single key and ensuring proper validation against those values, the function should correctly process form data and avoid validation errors for missing values.

### Updated Function
```python
async def request_body_to_args(
    required_params: List[ModelField],
    received_body: Optional[Union[Dict[str, Any], FormData]],
) -> Tuple[Dict[str, Any], List[ErrorWrapper]]:
    values = {}
    errors = []
    if required_params:
        for field in required_params:
            value: Any = None
            if received_body is not None:
                if field.shape in sequence_shapes and isinstance(
                    received_body, FormData
                ):
                    values[field.name] = received_body.getlist(field.alias)
                else:
                    raw_value = received_body.get(field.alias)
                    if isinstance(raw_value, list):
                        values[field.name] = raw_value
                    elif raw_value is not None:
                        values[field.name] = [raw_value]
            if field.required and field.name not in values:
                errors.append(ErrorWrapper(MissingError(), loc=("body", field.alias)))
            elif field.name not in values:
                values[field.name] = deepcopy(field.default) if field.default else None
            else:
                v_, errors_ = field.validate(values[field.name], values, loc=("body", field.alias))
                if isinstance(errors_, ErrorWrapper):
                    errors.append(errors_)
                elif isinstance(errors_, list):
                    errors.extend(errors_)
                else:
                    values[field.name] = v_
    return values, errors
```

This corrected version of the function addresses the issue by properly handling repeated keys in form data and validating against all values associated with a key. It ensures accurate processing of form data and correct error reporting.
