### Potential Error Locations:
1. The condition `received_body = {field.alias: received_body}` may not handle multiple occurrences of the same key in the `received_body`.
2. The validation for sequences such as list, set, and tuple may cause issues with handling repeated keys in FormData.

### Cause of the Bug:
The bug stems from the function not handling multiple occurrences of the same key in the `received_body`. It only considers the last value for a key when dealing with FormData, leading to discrepancies in the validation process.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Modify the function to handle multiple occurrences of the same key by collecting them as a list before validation.
2. Update the validation logic for sequences to properly handle repeated keys in FormData by parsing them into lists.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
async def request_body_to_args(
    required_params: List[ModelField],
    received_body: Optional[Union[Dict[str, Any], FormData]],
) -> Tuple[Dict[str, Any], List[ErrorWrapper]]:
    values = {}
    errors = []
    if required_params:
        for field in required_params:
            value: Any = None
            if received_body is not None:
                if field.shape in sequence_shapes and isinstance(
                    received_body, FormData
                ):
                    values[field.alias] = received_body.getlist(field.alias)
                else:
                    value = received_body.get(field.alias)
                    if isinstance(value, list):
                        values[field.alias] = value
                    else:
                        values[field.alias] = [value]

            v_, errors_ = field.validate(values[field.alias], values, loc=("body", field.alias))
            
            if isinstance(errors_, ErrorWrapper):
                errors.append(errors_)
            elif isinstance(errors_, list):
                errors.extend(errors_)
            else:
                values[field.name] = v_
    return values, errors
```

### Correction Summary:
1. Adjusted the logic to correctly handle multiple occurrences of the same key.
2. Updated the validation process to account for the data structure changes when dealing with repeated keys.
3. Simplified the code by removing unnecessary conditions and ensuring consistent handling of data.
