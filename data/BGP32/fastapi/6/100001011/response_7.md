### Analysis:
The buggy function `request_body_to_args` is designed to convert request body data into arguments based on required parameters and handle validation errors. However, there are issues related to handling repeated keys in form data, as highlighted in the GitHub issue.

### Potential Error Locations:
1. Handling repeated keys in form data may lead to incorrect validation of input values.
2. The approach to iterating over required parameters and processing received body data might need modification to address the issue with repeated keys.


### Bug Cause:
The function fails to correctly handle repeated keys in form data, resulting in only the last key=value pair being processed. This behavior conflicts with the expectation of treating repeated keys as a list. This inconsistency leads to validation errors and incorrect extraction of input values from the request body.

### Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, the function should be modified to properly handle repeated keys in form data. A solution could involve aggregating values associated with repeated keys into a list under the same key name before validation. This adjustment will align the processing with the desired behavior described in the GitHub issue.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
async def request_body_to_args(
    required_params: List[ModelField],
    received_body: Optional[Union[Dict[str, Any], FormData]],
) -> Tuple[Dict[str, Any], List[ErrorWrapper]]:
    values = {}
    errors = []
    for field in required_params:
        value: Any = None
        if received_body is not None:
            if field.shape in sequence_shapes and isinstance(
                received_body, FormData
            ):
                if field.alias in received_body:
                    value = received_body.getlist(field.alias)
            else:
                if field.alias in received_body:
                    value = received_body.get(field.alias)

        if value is None or (
            isinstance(field_info, params.Form)
            and field.shape in sequence_shapes
            and len(value) == 0
        ):
            if field.required:
                if PYDANTIC_1:
                    errors.append(
                        ErrorWrapper(MissingError(), loc=("body", field.alias))
                    )
                else:  # pragma: nocover
                    errors.append(
                        ErrorWrapper(  # type: ignore
                            MissingError(),
                            loc=("body", field.alias),
                            config=BaseConfig,
                        )
                    )
            else:
                values[field.name] = deepcopy(field.default)
            continue

        if (
            isinstance(field_info, params.File)
            and lenient_issubclass(field.type_, bytes)
            and isinstance(value, UploadFile)
        ):
            value = await value.read()
        elif (
            field.shape in sequence_shapes
            and isinstance(field_info, params.File)
            and lenient_issubclass(field.type_, bytes)
            and isinstance(value, sequence_types)
        ):
            awaitables = [sub_value.read() for sub_value in value]
            contents = await asyncio.gather(*awaitables)
            value = sequence_shape_to_type[field.shape](contents)
        
        v_, errors_ = field.validate(value, values, loc=("body", field.alias))
        if isinstance(errors_, ErrorWrapper):
            errors.append(errors_)
        elif isinstance(errors_, list):
            errors.extend(errors_)
        else:
            values[field.name] = v_

    return values, errors
```

This corrected version of the function addresses the issue of handling repeated keys in form data by appropriately processing them into lists before validation. This adjustment aligns with the desired behavior outlined in the GitHub issue.
