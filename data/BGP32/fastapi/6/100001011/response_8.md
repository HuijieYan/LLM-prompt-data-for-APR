### Analyzing the buggy function and the GitHub issue
The buggy function `request_body_to_args` is responsible for converting received request body data into arguments for a FastAPI endpoint. The issue relates to handling repeated keys in form data, where only the last key=value pair is considered.

Looking at the runtime values and types provided, it appears that the function is not handling repeated keys in form data correctly as per the GitHub issue's concern. This results in only the last key=value pair being processed, leading to validation errors due to missing data.

### Potential Error Locations:
1. The handling of `received_body` for multiple values of the same key.
2. The way the function checks and processes the values for each field.

### Cause of the Bug:
The bug arises from the function's assumption that only single values are present for each key in form data. When faced with repeated keys, it substitutes the value with the last occurrence, causing missing data and validation errors.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, the function should be modified to handle repeated keys correctly by collecting all values associated with a key and treating them as a list of values for that key.

### Corrected Version of the Function
Here is a corrected version of the function that addresses the issue of supporting repeated key=value pairs in form data:

```python
async def request_body_to_args(
    required_params: List[ModelField],
    received_body: Optional[Union[Dict[str, Any], FormData]],
) -> Tuple[Dict[str, Any], List[ErrorWrapper]]:
    values = {}
    errors = []
    
    if received_body is not None:    
        for field in required_params:
            value: Any = None
            if field.shape in sequence_shapes and isinstance(received_body, FormData):
                value = received_body.getlist(field.alias)
            else:
                value = received_body.get(field.alias)
                
            if value is None or (
                isinstance(field_info, params.Form)
                and field.shape in sequence_shapes
                and len(value) == 0
            ):
                if field.required:
                    if PYDANTIC_1:
                        errors.append(ErrorWrapper(MissingError(), loc=("body", field.alias)))
                    else:  # pragma: nocover
                        errors.append(
                            ErrorWrapper(MissingError(), loc=("body", field.alias), config=BaseConfig)
                        )
                else:
                    values[field.name] = deepcopy(field.default)
            else:
                if field.shape in sequence_shapes and isinstance(field_info, params.File) and lenient_issubclass(field.type_, bytes) and isinstance(value, sequence_types):
                    awaitables = [sub_value.read() for sub_value in value]
                    contents = await asyncio.gather(*awaitables)                    
                    value = sequence_shape_to_type[field.shape](contents)
                
                v_, errors_ = field.validate(value, values, loc=("body", field.alias))
                
                if isinstance(errors_, ErrorWrapper):
                    errors.append(errors_)
                elif isinstance(errors_, list):
                    errors.extend(errors_)
                else:
                    values[field.name] = v_

    return values, errors
```

This corrected version handles repeated keys correctly by collecting all associated values as a list of values for each key during the processing of form data. It ensures that all values are considered for validation, addressing the GitHub issue's concern.
