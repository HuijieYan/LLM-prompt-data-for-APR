### Analyzing the Bug
The buggy function `request_body_to_args` is responsible for converting received body data into arguments based on required parameters. The function seems to have a problem handling instances where a key has multiple values in the received body, causing issues during validation.

### Potential Error Locations
1. Processing of the received body with multiple values for the same key.
2. Incorrect assignment of values and errors based on the received body data.
3. Lack of handling repeated keys in the received form data.

### Cause of the Bug
The function is not designed to handle cases where a key in the received body has multiple values, leading to issues with validation and assignment of values/errors. This behavior is evident from the runtime input/output scenarios provided.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug
To resolve the bug and address the GitHub issue, the function needs to be modified to properly handle cases where a key has multiple values. This involves collecting all values for the same key in a list before carrying out validation and assignment.

### Corrected Version of the Function
Here is the corrected version of the function that handles repeated keys in form data by compiling the values into lists before validation:

```python
async def request_body_to_args(
    required_params: List[ModelField],
    received_body: Optional[Union[Dict[str, Any], FormData]],
) -> Tuple[Dict[str, Any], List[ErrorWrapper]]:
    values = {}
    errors = []
    
    if required_params:
        if isinstance(received_body, FormData):
            received_body_dict = received_body.multi_items()
        else:
            received_body_dict = received_body or {}
        
        for field in required_params:
            alias_values = [value for key, value in received_body_dict if key == field.alias]
            
            if not alias_values:
                if field.required:
                    errors.append(ErrorWrapper(MissingError(), loc=("body", field.alias)))
                else:
                    values[field.name] = deepcopy(field.default)
            else:
                if len(alias_values) == 1:
                    value = alias_values[0]
                else:
                    value = alias_values
                    
                if isinstance(field_info, params.File) and lenient_issubclass(field.type_, bytes):
                    if isinstance(value, list):
                        value = [await val.read() for val in value]
                    else:
                        value = await value.read()
                
                v_, errors_ = field.validate(value, values, loc=("body", field.alias))
                
                if isinstance(errors_, ErrorWrapper):
                    errors.append(errors_)
                elif isinstance(errors_, list):
                    errors.extend(errors_)
                else:
                    values[field.name] = v_
    
    return values, errors
```

This corrected version ensures that all values for the same key are processed and validated appropriately, addressing the issues related to repeated keys in the form data.
