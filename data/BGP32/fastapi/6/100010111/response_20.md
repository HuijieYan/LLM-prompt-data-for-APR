### Analysis
The buggy function `request_body_to_args` is designed to handle conversion of request body data to arguments. However, there are errors related to handling sequences like lists, sets, and tuples within form data. This leads to incorrect processing of sequences, causing the tests to fail and return a status code of 422 instead of the expected 200.

The code does not appropriately handle repeated keys in form data and incorrectly processes sequences within form data fields.

### Bug Cause
- The problem arises from the incorrect handling of sequences within form data. The function does not properly consider sequences and their representation within the form data structure.
- During validation and retrieval of values, incorrect assumptions about the structure of the data result in erroneous processing and validation.

### Bug Fix Strategy
- To fix this bug, it is necessary to correctly handle sequences within form data. This involves identifying and retrieving sequence values correctly, considering repeated keys in form data, and ensuring that sequence data structure representations align with expected behavior.
- Adjustments need to be made in how the function processes and validates data to correctly handle sequences within form data and prevent errors during retrieval and validation.

### Corrected Function
Below is the corrected version of the `request_body_to_args` function:

```python
async def request_body_to_args(
    required_params: List[ModelField],
    received_body: Optional[Union[Dict[str, Any], FormData]],
) -> Tuple[Dict[str, Any], List[ErrorWrapper]]:
    values = {}
    errors = []
    for field in required_params:
        value: Any = None
        if received_body is not None:
            if field.shape in sequence_shapes and isinstance(received_body, FormData):
                value = received_body.getlist(field.alias)
            else:
                value = received_body.get(field.alias)
        if (
            value is None
            or (isinstance(params.Form, params.Form) and value == "")
            or (
                isinstance(params.Form, params.Form)
                and field.shape in sequence_shapes
                and len(value) == 0
            )
        ):
            if field.required:
                if PYDANTIC_1:
                    errors.append(
                        ErrorWrapper(MissingError(), loc=("body", field.alias))
                    )
                else:
                    errors.append(
                        ErrorWrapper(
                            MissingError(), loc=("body", field.alias), config=BaseConfig
                        )
                    )
            else:
                values[field.name] = deepcopy(field.default)
            continue
        if (
            isinstance(params.File, params.File)
            and lenient_issubclass(field.type_, bytes)
            and isinstance(value, UploadFile)
        ):
            value = await value.read()
        v_, errors_ = field.validate(value, values, loc=("body", field.alias))
        if isinstance(errors_, ErrorWrapper):
            errors.append(errors_)
        elif isinstance(errors_, list):
            errors.extend(errors_)
        else:
            values[field.name] = v_
    return values, errors
```

This corrected version addresses the issues related to processing sequences within form data, ensuring correct retrieval, validation, and handling of sequence values in the code.

By applying this fix, the function should now pass the failing tests and correctly handle form data with non-typing sequences.
