### Analysis:
- The buggy function `request_body_to_args` is responsible for extracting values from the received body based on the required parameters. It handles various cases like sequences of values and files. 
- The bug seems related to handling repeating keys in form data which is not fully supported in the current implementation.
- The failing tests indicate that the response status code is 422 (validation error) instead of the expected 200.

### Bug Cause:
- The bug stems from the fact that the function is not handling repeated keys in the FormData input correctly, leading to validation errors.
- The function is not processing repeated keys effectively and not creating a list of values when a key is repeated in the form data input.
- This issue was not specifically addressed in the current implementation, leading to the incorrect behavior seen in the failing tests.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
- The fix involves modifying the function to correctly handle repeated keys in the FormData input.
- When a key is repeated, the function should accumulate the values into a list instead of just considering the last value.
- By updating the logic to capture and process repeated keys properly, the function should be able to handle these cases and eliminate the validation errors.

### Corrected Function:
```python
async def request_body_to_args(
    required_params: List[ModelField],
    received_body: Optional[Union[Dict[str, Any], FormData]],
) -> Tuple[Dict[str, Any], List[ErrorWrapper]]:
    values = {}
    errors = []
    for field in required_params:
        if received_body is not None:
            value: Any = None
            if field.shape in sequence_shapes and isinstance(received_body, FormData):
                value = received_body.getlist(field.alias)
            else:
                value = received_body.get(field.alias)
            if value is None or (isinstance(field_info, params.Form) and value == "") or (
                field.shape in sequence_shapes and len(value) == 0
            ):
                if field.required:
                    if PYDANTIC_1:
                        errors.append(
                            ErrorWrapper(MissingError(), loc=("body", field.alias))
                        )
                    else:
                        errors.append(
                            ErrorWrapper(MissingError(), loc=("body", field.alias), config=BaseConfig)
                        )
                else:
                    values[field.name] = deepcopy(field.default)
            else:
                if field.shape in sequence_shapes and not isinstance(value, (list, tuple, set)):
                    value = [value]
                if isinstance(field_info, params.File) and lenient_issubclass(field.type_, bytes) and isinstance(value, UploadFile):
                    value = await value.read()
                elif field.shape in sequence_shapes and isinstance(field_info, params.File) and lenient_issubclass(
                    field.type_, bytes) and isinstance(value, (list, tuple, set)):
                    awaitables = [sub_value.read() for sub_value in value]
                    contents = await asyncio.gather(*awaitables)
                    value = sequence_shape_to_type[field.shape](contents)
                    
                v_, errors_ = field.validate(value, values, loc=("body", field.alias))
                if isinstance(errors_, ErrorWrapper):
                    errors.append(errors_)
                elif isinstance(errors_, list):
                    errors.extend(errors_)
                else:
                    values[field.name] = v_
    return values, errors
```

By adjusting how the function handles repeated keys in the form data input, the corrected version should now be able to extract values correctly and pass the failing tests.
