### Analyzing the buggy function and the GitHub issue

The buggy function `request_body_to_args` is responsible for converting the received request body into arguments for FastAPI dependency functions. The function loops through required parameters, extracts values from the received body, checks for errors, and validates the values.

The GitHub issue highlights the problem of handling repeated keys in form data, where only the last key=value pair is considered. As per the issue, the suggested solution is to collect repeated keys and assign their values as a list before validation.

### Identified potential error locations
1. Handling of repeated keys in form data could be problematic.
2. Validation errors might not be handled correctly for non-last key=value pairs.
3. The function might not properly handle the scenario when a required field is not present in the received body.

### Explanation of the bug
The function doesn't handle repeated keys in form data correctly. It generates the dictionary with only the last key=value pair, causing validation issues for FastAPI dependency functions. This leads to a status code of 422 returned instead of the expected 200.

### Strategy for fixing the bug
To fix the bug, we need to modify how the function processes form data with repeated keys. A solution is to aggregate all values corresponding to the same key and then proceed with validation. Additionally, we should adjust the validation logic to properly handle all key=value pairs. Finally, ensure that missing required fields are handled appropriately.

### Corrected version of the function

```python
async def request_body_to_args(
    required_params: List[ModelField],
    received_body: Optional[Union[Dict[str, Any], FormData]],
) -> Tuple[Dict[str, Any], List[ErrorWrapper]]:
    values = {}
    errors = []
    
    if required_params:
        key_values = {}
        
        for field in required_params:
            alias = field.alias
            if alias in key_values:
                if not isinstance(key_values[alias], list):
                    key_values[alias] = [key_values[alias]]
                key_values[alias].append(received_body.get(alias, field.default))
            else:
                key_values[alias] = received_body.get(alias, field.default)
        
        for alias, value in key_values.items():
            field_info = get_field_info(required_params[0])
            field = next(x for x in required_params if x.alias == alias)
            
            if value is None or (isinstance(field_info, params.Form) and value == ""):
                if field.required:
                    errors.append(ErrorWrapper(MissingError(), loc=("body", alias))
                else:
                    values[field.name] = deepcopy(field.default)
            else:
                v_, errors_ = field.validate(value, values, loc=("body", alias))
                if isinstance(errors_, ErrorWrapper):
                    errors.append(errors_)
                elif isinstance(errors_, list):
                    errors.extend(errors_)
                else:
                    values[field.name] = v_
                
    return values, errors
```

With this correction, the function aggregates all values for the same key, correctly handles validation errors, and ensures missing required fields are accounted for. This should resolve the issue reported in the failing tests and align with the expected input/output values.
