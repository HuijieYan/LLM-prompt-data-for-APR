### Analysis:
1. The buggy function is `request_body_to_args` responsible for extracting values from the received body based on required parameters. It checks if the required field is in a sequence shape and correctly handles the data accordingly.
2. The potential error locations could be in how the function handles sequence data such as lists, sets, and tuples.
3. The cause of the bug could be related to how the function processes sequence data from the received body. The function may not correctly handle the submitted list data in FormData for lists, sets, or tuples, leading to validation errors.
4. To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the function correctly handles lists, sets, and tuples received in FormData and assigns them to the appropriate key. We also need to validate and process the sequence data correctly before returning the values.
5. I will provide a corrected version of the function below.

### Corrected Version:
```python
async def request_body_to_args(
    required_params: List[ModelField],
    received_body: Optional[Union[Dict[str, Any], FormData]],
) -> Tuple[Dict[str, Any], List[ErrorWrapper]]:
    values = {}
    errors = []
    if required_params:
        field = required_params[0]
        field_info = get_field_info(field)
        embed = getattr(field_info, "embed", None)
        if len(required_params) == 1 and not embed:
            received_body = {field.alias: received_body}
        for field in required_params:
            value: Any = None
            if received_body is not None:
                if field.shape in sequence_shapes and isinstance(
                    received_body, FormData
                ):
                    if field.shape == 1:
                        value = received_body.getlist(field.alias)
                    elif field.shape == 2:
                        value = received_body.getlist(field.alias, [])
                else:
                    value = received_body.get(field.alias)
            if (
                value is None
                or (isinstance(field_info, params.Form) and value == "")
                or (
                    isinstance(field_info, params.Form)
                    and field.shape in sequence_shapes
                    and len(value) == 0
                )
            ):
                if field.required:
                    if PYDANTIC_1:
                        errors.append(
                            ErrorWrapper(MissingError(), loc=("body", field.alias))
                        )
                    else:
                        errors.append(
                            ErrorWrapper(
                                MissingError(),
                                loc=("body", field.alias),
                                config=BaseConfig,
                            )
                        )
                else:
                    values[field.name] = deepcopy(field.default)
                continue
            if (
                isinstance(field_info, params.File)
                and lenient_issubclass(field.type_, bytes)
                and isinstance(value, UploadFile)
            ):
                value = await value.read()
            elif (
                field.shape in sequence_shapes
                and isinstance(field_info, params.File)
                and lenient_issubclass(field.type_, bytes)
                and isinstance(value, sequence_types)
            ):
                awaitables = [sub_value.read() for sub_value in value]
                contents = await asyncio.gather(*awaitables)
                value = sequence_shape_to_type[field.shape](contents)
            v_, errors_ = field.validate(value, values, loc=("body", field.alias))
            if isinstance(errors_, ErrorWrapper):
                errors.append(errors_)
            elif isinstance(errors_, list):
                errors.extend(errors_)
            else:
                values[field.name] = v_
    return values, errors
```

The corrected version includes handling different sequence shapes correctly from the received FormData and ensuring that the values are processed and validated according to the field type. This version should resolve the issue with handling repeated key=value pairs in form data in FastAPI.
