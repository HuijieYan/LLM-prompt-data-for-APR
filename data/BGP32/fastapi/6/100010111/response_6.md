### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `request_body_to_args` is responsible for converting request body parameters to arguments.
2. The error message indicates that the function is not handling the input data correctly, which causes a status code mismatch (422 instead of 200).
3. The function fails to correctly parse and handle form data with repeated keys (`choices=parrot&choices=spider`).
4. To fix this bug, the function needs to properly handle form data in the case of repeated keys, ensuring all values are collected as a list under the same key for validation.

### Bug Cause:
The cause of the bug is that the function does not account for handling form data with repeated keys. It only considers the last value for a key when processing the form data. This leads to incorrect values being collected and validated, causing mismatches in the expected return values.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to modify the function to handle form data with repeated keys properly. Each distinct value for a repeated key should be collected as a list under the same key. This will ensure that all values are considered during validation.

### Corrected Function:
Here's the corrected version of the `request_body_to_args` function:

```python
async def request_body_to_args(
    required_params: List[ModelField],
    received_body: Optional[Union[Dict[str, Any], FormData]],
) -> Tuple[Dict[str, Any], List[ErrorWrapper]]:
    values = {}
    errors = []
    if required_params and received_body is not None:
        for field in required_params:
            values[field.name] = []
            for key, value in received_body.items():
                if key == field.alias:
                    if isinstance(value, list):
                        values[field.name].extend(value)
                    else:
                        values[field.name].append(value)
    
            v_, errors_ = field.validate(values[field.name], values, loc=("body", field.alias))
            if isinstance(errors_, ErrorWrapper):
                errors.append(errors_)
            elif isinstance(errors_, list):
                errors.extend(errors_)
            else:
                values[field.name] = v_
    return values, errors
```

With the corrected function, the repeated keys in form data will be correctly handled, allowing all values to be collected and validated as expected. This should resolve the status code mismatch issue observed in the failing test cases.
