### Identification of Potential Error Locations
1. The code sets the `received_body` variable to {field.alias: received_body} if there is only one `required_params` field and `embed` is not present in the `field_info`. This could lead to incorrect data assignment.
2. The comparison of `field.shape` with `sequence_shapes` might not be checking the correct condition and could lead to issues with sequence type fields.
3. The handling of values and errors might not be properly updating the `values` dictionary and `errors` list.
4. The validation process and checking for Errors might not be correctly implemented.

### Explanation of the Bug
The bug in the `request_body_to_args` function causes incorrect handling of `required_params` when dealing with repeated key-value pairs in form data. Due to improper assignments, comparisons, and validations, the function fails to properly extract the data and process errors for the required parameters.

The failing tests indicate that the function is returning a status code of 422 instead of the expected 200. This discrepancy is caused by issues in the logic flow, value assignments, and error handling within the function.

### Bug Fix Strategy
1. Update the handling of repeated key-value pairs in form data to correctly extract and assign multiple values when validating against a single parameter.
2. Ensure that the comparison of `field.shape` with `sequence_shapes` is accurate and correctly handles sequence type fields.
3. Validate and update the `values` dictionary and `errors` list properly during the function execution.
4. Improve the validation process and error checking mechanisms to handle and report errors appropriately.

### Corrected Version of the Function
```python
async def request_body_to_args(
    required_params: List[ModelField],
    received_body: Optional[Union[Dict[str, Any], FormData]],
) -> Tuple[Dict[str, Any], List[ErrorWrapper]]:
    values = {}
    errors = []
    if required_params:
        for field in required_params:
            field_info = get_field_info(field)
            embed = getattr(field_info, "embed", None)
            value: Any = None
            if received_body is not None:
                if field.shape in sequence_shapes and isinstance(received_body, FormData):
                    all_values = received_body.getlist(field.alias)
                    if len(all_values) == 1 and not embed:
                        value = all_values[0]
                    else:
                        value = all_values
                else:
                    value = received_body.get(field.alias)

            if value is None or (isinstance(field_info, params.Form) and value == "") or (
                isinstance(field_info, params.Form) and field.shape in sequence_shapes and len(value) == 0
            ):
                if field.required:
                    # Add missing error based on key name
                    errors.append(ErrorWrapper(MissingError(), loc=("body", field.alias)))
                else:
                    values[field.name] = deepcopy(field.default)
                continue

            if (
                isinstance(field_info, params.File)
                and lenient_issubclass(field.type_, bytes)
                and isinstance(value, UploadFile)
            ):
                value = await value.read()
            elif (
                field.shape in sequence_shapes
                and lenient_issubclass(field.type_, bytes)
                and isinstance(value, sequence_types)
            ):
                awaitables = [sub_value.read() for sub_value in value]
                contents = await asyncio.gather(*awaitables)
                value = sequence_shape_to_type[field.shape](contents)

            v_, errors_ = field.validate(value, values, loc=("body", field.alias))
            if isinstance(errors_, ErrorWrapper):
                errors.append(errors_)
            elif isinstance(errors_, list):
                errors.extend(errors_)

            values[field.name] = v_

    return values, errors
```

This corrected version of the `request_body_to_args` function addresses the issues mentioned above and should now handle repeated key-value pairs in form data correctly and ensure accurate data extraction, validation, and error reporting. The function should now pass the failing tests and align with the expected input/output values.
