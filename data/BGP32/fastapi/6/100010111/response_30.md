### Analysis
The buggy function `request_body_to_args` is responsible for processing required parameters and received body data to extract values and handle errors. The function loops through the required params, retrieves the corresponding values from the received body, handles special cases for files, and performs validation of the extracted values.

The potential error locations in the function include the processing of the received body data, validation checks for required fields, handling of file types, and building the final values dictionary.

The cause of the bug is related to the processing of repeated keys in the form data. The function is unable to correctly handle scenarios where the same key appears multiple times in the form data (`FormData`) which is a requirement specified in the GitHub issue "Support repeated key=value in form data".

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug
To fix the bug and address the GitHub issue, we need to modify the function to correctly handle repeated keys in the form data. Instead of overwriting the values associated with the same key, we should aggregate them into lists as suggested in the GitHub issue. This adjustment will ensure that all values for the same key are captured and treated appropriately.

We need to modify the logic responsible for extracting values from the received body, especially for cases where the same key appears multiple times. By updating this logic, we can ensure that the values are correctly processed and stored in the final values dictionary.

### Corrected Version of the Function
```python
async def request_body_to_args(
    required_params: List[ModelField],
    received_body: Optional[Union[Dict[str, Any], FormData]],
) -> Tuple[Dict[str, Any], List[ErrorWrapper]]:
    values = {}
    errors = []
    if required_params:
        for field in required_params:
            if received_body is not None:
                if isinstance(received_body, FormData):
                    values[field.name] = received_body.getlist(field.alias)
                else:
                    values[field.name] = received_body.get(field.alias)

            if field.required and values.get(field.name) is None:
                if PYDANTIC_1:
                    errors.append(ErrorWrapper(MissingError(), loc=("body", field.alias)))
                else:
                    errors.append(
                        ErrorWrapper(
                            MissingError(), loc=("body", field.alias), config=BaseConfig
                        )
                    )
                continue

            if isinstance(field.info, params.File) and isinstance(
                field.type_, bytes
            ) and isinstance(values[field.name], UploadFile):
                values[field.name] = await values[field.name].read()

            v_, errors_ = field.validate(
                values.get(field.name), values, loc=("body", field.alias)
            )

            if isinstance(errors_, ErrorWrapper):
                errors.append(errors_)
            elif isinstance(errors_, list):
                errors.extend(errors_)
            else:
                values[field.name] = v_

    return values, errors
```

This corrected version of the function includes adjustments to properly handle repeated keys in form data and ensure that all corresponding values are captured correctly. Additionally, it addresses the GitHub issue by aggregating values associated with the same key into lists.
