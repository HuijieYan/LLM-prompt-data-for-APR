### Analysis:
- The function `request_body_to_args` is meant to convert the request body data into a dictionary of values and track any errors encountered during validation.
- The bug causes incorrect processing of sequence values (lists, sets, tuples) in the request body, leading to a status code error in the tests.
- The issue in focus is related to handling repeated keys in form data.

### Bug Cause:
1. The function incorrectly handles repeated keys in form data. When multiple values are present for the same key, only the last value wins, which results in incorrect validation.
2. For cases involving lists, sets, and tuples, the function does not correctly process the input data and fails to produce the expected values for the response.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
1. Modify the function logic to correctly handle repeated keys in form data and process them as a list of values.
2. Adjust the processing of sequences in the request body to accurately capture the data and populate the output dictionary accordingly.

### Code Fix:
Below is the corrected version of the `request_body_to_args` function:

```python
async def request_body_to_args(
    required_params: List[ModelField],
    received_body: Optional[Union[Dict[str, Any], FormData]],
) -> Tuple[Dict[str, Any], List[ErrorWrapper]]:
    values = {}
    errors = []
    for field in required_params:
        value = None
        if received_body is not None:
            if field.shape in sequence_shapes and isinstance(received_body, FormData):
                if field.alias in received_body:
                    value = received_body.getlist(field.alias)
            else:
                value = received_body.get(field.alias)

        if value is None or (
            isinstance(field_info, params.Form)
            and field.shape in sequence_shapes
            and len(value) == 0
        ):
            if field.required:
                errors.append(ErrorWrapper(MissingError(), loc=("body", field.alias))
            else:
                values[field.name] = deepcopy(field.default)
        else:
            if (
                isinstance(field_info, params.File)
                and lenient_issubclass(field.type_, bytes)
                and isinstance(value, UploadFile)
            ):
                value = await value.read()
            v_, errors_ = field.validate(value, values, loc=("body", field.alias))
            if isinstance(errors_, ErrorWrapper):
                errors.append(errors_)
            elif isinstance(errors_, list):
                errors.extend(errors_)
            else:
                values[field.name] = v_
    return values, errors
```

By making the above changes, the function should now correctly handle repeated keys in the form data, process sequences accurately, and provide the expected output values for each test case.
