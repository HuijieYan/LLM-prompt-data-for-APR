### Analysis:
- The `request_body_to_args` function is supposed to convert received request body data into arguments for a FastAPI route. It iterates over the required parameters, processes the received body data accordingly, and validates the values against the parameters.
- The issue seems to be related to handling form data with repeated keys, such as in the cases where a key appears multiple times with different values. Fixing this bug should address the issue reported in the GitHub problem statement.
- The failing tests indicate that the function is not processing the form data correctly when dealing with list, set, and tuple fields.

### Identified potential errors:
1. Handling of repeated keys in form data (`FormData`) is not correctly processed.
2. The processing for sequence shapes (like list, set, tuple) is not functioning as expected.
3. Validation and conversion of incoming data to the correct data structure (list, set, tuple) is not working as intended.

### Bug Explanation:
The bug is related to how the function processes form data with repeated keys. It currently does not consider the case where a key appears multiple times with different values. This results in incorrect handling of list, set, and tuple fields, leading to validation errors during tests.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Modify the logic to correctly handle repeated keys in form data by grouping them into lists before validation.
2. Ensure that the function properly interprets and processes sequence shapes (list, set, tuple) based on the data received.
3. Update the data conversion and validation steps to align with the expected input/output types.

### Corrected Function:
```python
async def request_body_to_args(
    required_params: List[ModelField],
    received_body: Optional[Union[Dict[str, Any], FormData]],
) -> Tuple[Dict[str, Any], List[ErrorWrapper]]:
    values = {}
    errors = []
    if required_params:
        for field in required_params:
            value: Any = None
            if received_body is not None:
                if isinstance(received_body, FormData):
                    if field.shape in sequence_shapes:
                        values_list = received_body.getlist(field.alias)
                        value = sequence_shape_to_type[field.shape](values_list)
                    else:
                        value = received_body.get(field.alias)
            if value is None or value == "":
                if field.required:
                    errors.append(ErrorWrapper(MissingError(), loc=("body", field.alias)))
                else:
                    values[field.name] = deepcopy(field.default)
                continue
            if (
                isinstance(field_info, params.File)
                and lenient_issubclass(field.type_, bytes)
                and isinstance(value, UploadFile)
            ):
                value = await value.read()
            v_, errors_ = field.validate(value, values, loc=("body", field.alias))
            if isinstance(errors_, ErrorWrapper):
                errors.append(errors_)
            elif isinstance(errors_, list):
                errors.extend(errors_)
            else:
                values[field.name] = v_
    return values, errors
```

This corrected version of the `request_body_to_args` function should address the issues related to handling repeated keys in form data and correctly processing sequence shapes. It aligns with the expected input and output values for the failing test cases provided.
