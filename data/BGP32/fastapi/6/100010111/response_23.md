### Analysis:
1. The provided buggy function is `request_body_to_args` which is responsible for extracting values from the received body based on the required parameters.
2. The function processes each required parameter to extract the corresponding value from the received body.
3. The bug is likely related to handling repeated keys in the FormData correctly, which is in line with the GitHub issue stating the problem with repeated key=value pairs in form data.
4. The expected input includes a list of required parameters and FormData with repeated keys to be processed correctly.
5. The function is failing to properly handle repeated keys in the FormData, leading to the incorrect validation and mismatched status codes in the test cases.

### Bug Cause:
The bug occurs due to the incorrect processing of repeated keys in the FormData. When the function encounters multiple values for the same key, it only considers the last value and discards the previous ones. This behavior leads to incorrect values being extracted and hence failing the test cases.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, the function should be updated to correctly handle repeated keys in FormData and collect those values into a list before validation. This change aligns with the GitHub issue's suggested solution to support repeated key=value pairs in form data.

### Corrected Function:
```python
async def request_body_to_args(
    required_params: List[ModelField],
    received_body: Optional[Union[Dict[str, Any], FormData]],
) -> Tuple[Dict[str, Any], List[ErrorWrapper]]:
    values = {}
    errors = []
    
    if required_params:
        for field in required_params:
            value: Any = None
            if received_body is not None:
                if field.shape == 1 and isinstance(received_body, FormData):
                    value = received_body.getlist(field.alias)
                else:
                    value = received_body.get(field.alias)
                
                if value is None or (isinstance(field_info, params.Form) and value == ""):
                    if field.required:
                        errors.append(ErrorWrapper(MissingError(), loc=("body", field.alias)))
                    else:
                        values[field.name] = deepcopy(field.default)
                else:
                    if field_info.embed:
                        values[field.name] = value
                    else:
                        values[field.name] = value[-1] if isinstance(value, list) else value
            
            v_, errors_ = field.validate(value, values, loc=("body", field.alias))
            if isinstance(errors_, ErrorWrapper):
                errors.append(errors_)
            elif isinstance(errors_, list):
                errors.extend(errors_)
            else:
                values[field.name] = v_
                
    return values, errors
```

By updating how the function handles repeated keys in FormData and correctly collecting their values into a list before validation, the corrected version should now pass the failing test cases and align with the expected input/output values.
