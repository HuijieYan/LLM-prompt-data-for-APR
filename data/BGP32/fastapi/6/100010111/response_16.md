### Analysis:
- The buggy function `request_body_to_args` is responsible for converting required parameters and received request body into a dictionary of values and a list of errors.
- The error messages indicate that the function is not handling the form data properly when the input consists of non-typing sequences like list, set, and tuple.
- The function should correctly process form data containing repeated keys to support non-typing sequences like list, set, and tuple.
- The GitHub issue suggests that FastAPI should collect repeated keys in the form data and assign those values as a list to the same key before validation.

### Bug:
The buggy function does not handle form data containing repeated keys efficiently, leading to incorrect values and errors, resulting in HTTP 422 error codes instead of 200 status codes.

### Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug in the `request_body_to_args` function, we need to update the logic for processing form data with repeated keys. Additionally, we should handle non-typing sequences properly to support list, set, and tuple inputs.

### Corrected Version:
```python
async def request_body_to_args(
    required_params: List[ModelField],
    received_body: Optional[Union[Dict[str, Any], FormData]],
) -> Tuple[Dict[str, Any], List[ErrorWrapper]]:
    values = {}
    errors = []
    for field in required_params:
        field_info = get_field_info(field)
        if received_body is not None:
            if field.alias in received_body:
                value = received_body.getlist(field.alias)
                if isinstance(field.type_, type) and issubclass(field.type_, list):
                    value = value if isinstance(value, list) else [value]
                if field.required and not value:
                    errors.append(ErrorWrapper(MissingError(), loc=("body", field.alias)))
                else:
                    try:
                        v_, errors_ = field.validate(value, values, loc=("body", field.alias))
                        if isinstance(errors_, ErrorWrapper):
                            errors.append(errors_)
                        elif isinstance(errors_, list):
                            errors.extend(errors_)
                        else:
                            values[field.name] = v_
                    except Exception as e:
                        errors.append(ErrorWrapper(e, loc=("body", field.alias)))
            elif field.required:
                errors.append(ErrorWrapper(MissingError(), loc=("body", field.alias)))
            else:
                values[field.name] = deepcopy(field.default)
    return values, errors
```

### Explanation:
- The corrected version of the function now correctly retrieves values for each field alias from the received form data, including handling repeated keys.
- It checks if the received body contains the field alias and then processes the values accordingly, converting them to lists if needed for non-typing sequences.
- The function now properly validates the values against the field definition and handles any exceptions that may occur during validation.
- This corrected version should address the handling of repeated keys and improve the processing of form data with non-typing sequences, resolving the issue reported in the GitHub discussion.
