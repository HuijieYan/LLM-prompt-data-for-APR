### Analysis:
The buggy function `request_body_to_args` is responsible for converting the received body data into arguments based on the required parameters. The function has issues with handling sequences such as lists, sets, and tuples when passed as form data. The function fails to correctly extract and validate the data in sequential shapes.

1. The function incorrectly handles the scenario when a single parameter's key is repeated in the received body.
2. The function does not properly process lists, sets, and tuples passed as form data causing validation errors.

### Bug Explanation:
The bug arises from the function's incorrect handling of sequential shapes in form data. The function does not correctly extract repeated keys, leading to validation errors when dealing with lists, sets, and tuples passed as form data.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to adjust how the function processes form data with repeated keys and extract the values correctly for lists, sets, and tuples passed as form data.

### Corrected Function:
Below is the corrected version of the `request_body_to_args` function:

```python
async def request_body_to_args(
    required_params: List[ModelField],
    received_body: Optional[Union[Dict[str, Any], FormData]],
) -> Tuple[Dict[str, Any], List[ErrorWrapper]]:
    values = {}
    errors = []
    for field in required_params:
        value = None
        if received_body is not None:
            if field.shape in sequence_shapes and isinstance(received_body, FormData):
                value = received_body.getlist(field.alias)
                if len(value) == 1:  # Handle single value for sequence
                    value = value[0]
            else:
                value = received_body.get(field.alias)

        if value is None and field.required:
            if PYDANTIC_1:
                errors.append(ErrorWrapper(MissingError(), loc=("body", field.alias)))
            else:
                errors.append(
                    ErrorWrapper(MissingError(), loc=("body", field.alias), config=BaseConfig)
                )
        else:
            if isinstance(field_info, params.File) and lenient_issubclass(field.type_, bytes) and isinstance(value, UploadFile):
                value = await value.read()
            v_, errors_ = field.validate(value, values, loc=("body", field.alias))
            if isinstance(errors_, (ErrorWrapper, list)):
                errors.extend(errors_)
            else:
                values[field.name] = v_

    return values, errors
```

This corrected version properly handles repeated keys for sequences and extracts the values accordingly. It also ensures the correct handling of repeated keys for lists, sets, and tuples passed as form data.

By applying this fix, the function should now pass the failing tests and align with the expected input/output values while also resolving the GitHub issue related to supporting repeated key=value pairs in form data.
