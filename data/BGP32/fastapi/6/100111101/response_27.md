The bug in the `request_body_to_args` function arises from how it handles sequence shapes (like lists, sets, and tuples) when extracting values from the received body. The current implementation causes errors due to incorrect handling of these shapes.

The main issue lies in the logic for extracting values from the received body when dealing with sequence shapes. The code incorrectly processes the value from the received body, leading to validation errors and incorrect behavior.

To fix the bug, we need to update the logic for extracting values based on the sequence shape of the field. We should handle lists, sets, and tuples differently to correctly parse the received data.

Here is the corrected version of the `request_body_to_args` function:

```python
async def request_body_to_args(
    required_params: List[ModelField],
    received_body: Optional[Union[Dict[str, Any], FormData]],
) -> Tuple[Dict[str, Any], List[ErrorWrapper]]:
    values = {}
    errors = []
    if required_params:
        field = required_params[0]
        for field in required_params:
            value = None
            if received_body is not None:
                value = received_body.get(field.alias)
                if field.shape in sequence_shapes:
                    if isinstance(value, list) or isinstance(value, FormData):
                        value = value.getlist(field.alias)
                    elif isinstance(value, set):
                        value = set(value.getlist(field.alias))
                    elif isinstance(value, tuple):
                        value = tuple(value.getlist(field.alias))

            # Remaining validation and handling remains the same
            v_, errors_ = field.validate(value, values, loc=("body", field.alias))
            if isinstance(errors_, ErrorWrapper):
                errors.append(errors_)
            elif isinstance(errors_, list):
                errors.extend(errors_)
            else:
                values[field.name] = v_

    return values, errors
```

With this corrected implementation, the function should now correctly handle sequence shapes such as lists, sets, and tuples when extracting values from the received body. This correction should address the validation errors observed in the failing tests.
