The bug in the `request_body_to_args` function seems to be related to how it processes different types of sequences (lists, sets, tuples) in the received body data. The current implementation fails to correctly extract and handle these sequences, leading to validation errors and incorrect results.

### Bug Explanation:

1. The function doesn't consider the case when the received body data is a FormData with multiple values for the same key (items). It incorrectly processes the values without grouping them correctly as a list, set, or tuple.

2. The function doesn't handle sequences (lists, sets, tuples) properly when extracting values from the received body or when validating them.

### Fix Strategy:
1. Check the type of the received data and handle multiple values correctly in the case of lists, sets, and tuples.
   
2. Ensure that the function processes and validates sequences properly for different field types (list, set, tuple).

### Corrected Version of the Function:

```python
async def request_body_to_args(
    required_params: List[ModelField],
    received_body: Optional[Union[Dict[str, Any], FormData]],
) -> Tuple[Dict[str, Any], List[ErrorWrapper]]:
    values = {}
    errors = []
    for field in required_params:
        value = None
        if received_body is not None:
            # Extract the values based on the field type
            if isinstance(received_body, FormData):
                key_values = received_body.getlist(field.alias)
                if field.shape == 1:
                    value = key_values[0] if len(key_values) == 1 else key_values
                elif field.shape == 2:
                    value = set(key_values)
                else:
                    value = tuple(key_values)

        if value is None and field.required:
            errors.append(ErrorWrapper(MissingError(), loc=("body", field.alias)))
        else:
            v_, errors_ = field.validate(value, values, loc=("body", field.alias))
            if isinstance(errors_, ErrorWrapper):
                errors.append(errors_)
            elif isinstance(errors_, list):
                errors.extend(errors_)
            else:
                values[field.name] = v_

    return values, errors
```
Now this corrected version should properly handle lists, sets, and tuples in the received body data and perform field validation accordingly.

By replacing the buggy function with this corrected version, all the failing tests should pass successfully.
