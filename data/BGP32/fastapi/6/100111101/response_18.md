Based on the analysis of the provided buggy function and the failing tests along with their input/output values, we identified the issue causing the failures. The problem lies in how the function handles different types of sequences like lists, sets, and tuples when parsing the received body data. The function does not properly extract the values from the FormData and assign them to the correct structure.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the function to correctly handle the conversion of sequence types from the FormData. By iterating over the received body values and extracting the appropriate type of sequence, we can ensure that the values are correctly assigned and validated.

Here is the corrected version of the `request_body_to_args` function:

```python
async def request_body_to_args(
    required_params: List[ModelField],
    received_body: Optional[Union[Dict[str, Any], FormData]],
) -> Tuple[Dict[str, Any], List[ErrorWrapper]]:
    values = {}
    errors = []
    for field in required_params:
        value = None
        if received_body is not None:
            if isinstance(received_body, FormData):
                if field.shape == 2:  # Check if the field shape is a set
                    value = set(received_body.getlist(field.alias))
                elif field.shape == 3:  # Check if the field shape is a tuple
                    value = tuple(received_body.getlist(field.alias))
                else:  # Default to list
                    value = received_body.getlist(field.alias)
            else:
                value = received_body.get(field.alias)
        if value is None or (isinstance(field_info, params.Form) and value == ""):
            if field.required:
                errors.append(ErrorWrapper(MissingError(), loc=("body", field.alias)))
            else:
                values[field.name] = deepcopy(field.default)
        else:
            v_, errors_ = field.validate(value, values, loc=("body", field.alias))
            if isinstance(errors_, ErrorWrapper):
                errors.append(errors_)
            elif isinstance(errors_, list):
                errors.extend(errors_)
            else:
                values[field.name] = v_
    return values, errors
```

With this correction, the function should now properly handle different types of sequences from the received body data, ensuring the correct values are extracted, assigned, and validated according to the specified field types. This should fix the failing tests and align the function's behavior with the expected input/output values.
