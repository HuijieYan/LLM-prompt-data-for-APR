### Bug Explanation
The bug originates from how the function processes values for different types of fields (list, set, tuple) when received as form data. The function incorrectly assigns the received values based on the field shape, causing errors in validation and ultimately leading to the incorrect status code (422 instead of 200) in the failing tests.

The main issue arises from how the `value` is handled for sequence shapes (list, set, tuple) and file uploads. The function fails to correctly parse and assign values for sequences and files, which results in validation errors and incorrect output.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, the function needs to correctly handle sequence shapes (like list, set, tuple) and file uploads when parsing the received data. Ensure that the function properly retrieves the values for each field type and processes them accordingly to pass the validation checks and return the expected status code.

### Corrected Version of the Function
```python
async def request_body_to_args(
    required_params: List[ModelField],
    received_body: Optional[Union[Dict[str, Any], FormData]],
) -> Tuple[Dict[str, Any], List[ErrorWrapper]]:
    values = {}
    errors = []
    if required_params:
        for field in required_params:
            if received_body is not None:
                value = None
                if field.shape in sequence_shapes and isinstance(received_body, FormData):
                    if field.alias in received_body.keys():
                        value = received_body.getlist(field.alias)
                else:
                    value = received_body.get(field.alias)
                    
                if value is not None and (isinstance(field_info, params.File) or field.shape not in sequence_shapes):
                    if isinstance(field_info, params.File) and lenient_issubclass(field.type_, bytes) and isinstance(value, UploadFile):
                        value = await value.read()
                    elif field.shape in sequence_shapes and isinstance(value, sequence_types):
                        awaitables = [sub_value.read() for sub_value in value]
                        contents = await asyncio.gather(*awaitables)
                        value = sequence_shape_to_type[field.shape](contents)
                    
                v_, errors_ = field.validate(value, values, loc=("body", field.alias))
                if isinstance(errors_, ErrorWrapper):
                    errors.append(errors_)
                elif isinstance(errors_, list):
                    errors.extend(errors_)
                else:
                    values[field.name] = v_
            else:
                if field.required:
                    if PYDANTIC_1:
                        errors.append(ErrorWrapper(MissingError(), loc=("body", field.alias)))
                    else:
                        errors.append(ErrorWrapper(MissingError(), loc=("body", field.alias), config=BaseConfig))
                else:
                    values[field.name] = deepcopy(field.default)
    return values, errors
```

The corrected version of the function now takes into account the specific logic needed for handling sequence shapes (list, set, tuple) and file uploads. By properly extracting and processing the received data, the function can now correctly handle the validation and return the expected values, resolving the issue with the failing tests.
