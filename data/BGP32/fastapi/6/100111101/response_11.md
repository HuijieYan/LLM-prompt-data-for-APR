The bug in the provided function `request_body_to_args` is caused by the incorrect handling of sequence shapes like lists, sets, and tuples when processing the received body data.

The current implementation assumes that the received body is a dictionary, which causes issues when dealing with sequences such as lists, sets, and tuples.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the logic inside the function to correctly handle different sequence shapes and extract the values accordingly.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
async def request_body_to_args(
    required_params: List[ModelField],
    received_body: Optional[Union[Dict[str, Any], FormData]],
) -> Tuple[Dict[str, Any], List[ErrorWrapper]]:
    values = {}
    errors = []
    for field in required_params:
        value = None
        if received_body is not None:
            if field.shape in sequence_shapes and isinstance(received_body, FormData):
                if field.alias in received_body:
                    value = received_body.getlist(field.alias)
            else:
                value = received_body.get(field.alias, None)
            
        if value is None or (
            isinstance(field_info, params.Form)
            and isinstance(value, str)
            and value == ""
        ):
            value = deepcopy(field.default) if not field.required else None
        if value is not None:
            v_, errors_ = field.validate(value, values, loc=("body", field.alias))
            if errors_:
                if isinstance(errors_, ErrorWrapper):
                    errors.append(errors_)
                else:
                    errors.extend(errors_)

            values[field.name] = v_

    return values, errors
```

With this corrected version, the function should now correctly handle lists, sets, and tuples in the received body data and process them accordingly based on the required parameters.

Make sure to test the function with the failing test cases provided to ensure that it now passes all the tests successfully.
