### Bug Explanation
The bug in the `request_body_to_args` function is due to how it handles different types of fields when parsing the received body. The function currently processes each field one by one without considering the overall structure of the received body. This becomes problematic when dealing with sequences like lists, sets, and tuples because the function incorrectly processes them as individual values instead of the sequence as a whole.

For example, in the failing test cases provided:
- Case 1 expects the function to parse a list field correctly by capturing all values in the list from the received body.
- Case 2 expects the function to parse a set field by correctly capturing the set of values from the received body.
- Case 3 expects the function to parse a tuple field by correctly capturing all values in the tuple from the received body.

However, the function fails to do so because it does not handle sequences properly, resulting in the incorrect error responses and status codes seen in the failing tests.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, the function needs to handle sequences (lists, sets, tuples) in a way that correctly captures all values in the sequence from the received body as a whole. Here are the steps to address the bug:
1. Check if the field type is a sequence (e.g., list, set, tuple).
2. If it is a sequence, extract and process all the values as a single unit before validation.
3. Update the values dictionary and errors list accordingly.
4. Ensure that the function correctly handles different types of sequences and fields.

### Corrected Function
```python
async def request_body_to_args(
    required_params: List[ModelField],
    received_body: Optional[Union[Dict[str, Any], FormData]],
) -> Tuple[Dict[str, Any], List[ErrorWrapper]]:
    values = {}
    errors = []
    if required_params:
        for field in required_params:
            value: Any = None
            if received_body is not None:
                if field.shape in sequence_shapes and isinstance(
                    received_body, FormData
                ):
                    if field.shape == 1:
                        value = received_body.getlist(field.alias)
                    elif field.shape == 2:
                        value = [received_body.get(field.alias) for _ in range(len(received_body.getlist(field.alias)))]
                else:
                    value = received_body.get(field.alias)
                
            if value is None or (isinstance(field_info, params.Form) and value == ""):
                if field.required:
                    errors.append(
                        ErrorWrapper(MissingError(), loc=("body", field.alias))
                    )
                else:
                    values[field.name] = deepcopy(field.default)
                continue
            
            if (
                isinstance(field_info, params.File)
                and lenient_issubclass(field.type_, bytes)
                and isinstance(value, UploadFile)
            ):
                value = await value.read()
            
            v_, errors_ = field.validate(value, values, loc=("body", field.alias))
            if isinstance(errors_, ErrorWrapper):
                errors.append(errors_)
            elif isinstance(errors_, list):
                errors.extend(errors_)
            else:
                values[field.name] = v_
            
    return values, errors
``` 

By updating the function to correctly handle different sequence shapes and types, the corrected version is expected to pass the failing tests and provide the expected input/output values outlined above for each case.
