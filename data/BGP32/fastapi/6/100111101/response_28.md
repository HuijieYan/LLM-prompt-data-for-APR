The bug in the `request_body_to_args` function stems from the incorrect handling of sequence shapes (lists, sets, tuples) in the received body. The bug fails to properly extract and validate the values within these sequences, causing the function to return errors instead of the expected values.

To fix the bug, we need to adjust the logic in the function to correctly handle sequences such as lists, sets, and tuples within the received form data. Specifically, we need to modify how the values are retrieved and processed based on the shape of the field.

Here is the corrected version of the `request_body_to_args` function:

```python
async def request_body_to_args(
    required_params: List[ModelField],
    received_body: Optional[Union[Dict[str, Any], FormData]],
) -> Tuple[Dict[str, Any], List[ErrorWrapper]]:
    values = {}
    errors = []
    
    for field in required_params:
        field_info = get_field_info(field)
        embed = getattr(field_info, "embed", None)
        if len(required_params) == 1 and not embed:
            received_body = {field.alias: received_body}

        value: Any = None
        if received_body is not None:
            if field.shape in sequence_shapes and isinstance(received_body, FormData):
                if field.alias in received_body:
                    value = received_body.getlist(field.alias)
            else:
                value = received_body.get(field.alias)

        if value is None or (isinstance(field_info, params.Form) and value == ""):
            if field.required:
                errors.append(ErrorWrapper(MissingError(), loc=("body", field.alias))
            else:
                values[field.name] = deepcopy(field.default)
        else:
            if isinstance(field_info, params.File) and lenient_issubclass(field.type_, bytes) and isinstance(value, UploadFile):
                value = await value.read()
            v_, errors_ = field.validate(value, values, loc=("body", field.alias))
            if isinstance(errors_, ErrorWrapper):
                errors.append(errors_)
            elif isinstance(errors_, list):
                errors.extend(errors_)
            else:
                values[field.name] = v_

    return values, errors
```

This corrected version ensures that the function properly handles sequence shapes in the received form data by extracting the values based on the shape of the field passed in the required parameters list.

With the corrected function in place, the failing tests for Python list, set, and tuple parameters in form data should now pass successfully.
