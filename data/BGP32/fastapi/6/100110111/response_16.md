## Analysis
1. The buggy function `request_body_to_args` is responsible for extracting values from the received body based on the required parameters (ModelFields) provided. It handles various scenarios like files, sequences, etc.
2. The failing tests show that the function is returning a status code of 422 instead of the expected 200. This discrepancy arises when dealing with non-typing sequences like lists, sets, and tuples.
3. The source of the bug seems related to how the function processes the received body and extracts values for non-typing sequences. The function should correctly handle such cases and return the expected output.
4. To fix the bug, we need to ensure that for non-typing sequence fields like lists, sets, and tuples, the function correctly extracts and processes the values from the received body.

## Bug Fix Strategy
1. Update the logic for handling sequence shapes such as lists, sets, and tuples in the function to properly extract values from the received body.
2. Ensure that the values extracted for non-typing sequences are processed and validated correctly before returning.

## Bug Fix
```python
async def request_body_to_args(
    required_params: List[ModelField],
    received_body: Optional[Union[Dict[str, Any], FormData]],
) -> Tuple[Dict[str, Any], List[ErrorWrapper]]:
    values = {}
    errors = []
    if required_params:
        field = required_params[0]
        field_info = get_field_info(field)
        embed = getattr(field_info, "embed", None)
        if len(required_params) == 1 and not embed:
            received_body = {field.alias: received_body}
        for field in required_params:
            value: Any = None
            if received_body is not None:
                value = received_body.get(field.alias)
                if value is not None:
                    if field.shape in sequence_shapes:
                        if isinstance(received_body, FormData):
                            value = received_body.getlist(field.alias)
                        else:
                            value = [received_body.get(field.alias)]
            if value is None:
                if field.required:
                    if PYDANTIC_1:
                        errors.append(
                            ErrorWrapper(MissingError(), loc=("body", field.alias))
                        )
                    else:
                        errors.append(
                            ErrorWrapper(  # type: ignore
                                MissingError(),
                                loc=("body", field.alias),
                                config=BaseConfig,
                            )
                        )
                else:
                    values[field.name] = deepcopy(field.default)
                continue

            if isinstance(field_info, params.File) and lenient_issubclass(field.type_, bytes):
                if isinstance(value, UploadFile):
                    value = await value.read()
                elif field.shape in sequence_shapes and isinstance(value, sequence_types):
                    awaitables = [sub_value.read() for sub_value in value]
                    contents = await asyncio.gather(*awaitables)
                    value = sequence_shape_to_type[field.shape](contents)

            v_, errors_ = field.validate(value, values, loc=("body", field.alias))
            if isinstance(errors_, ErrorWrapper):
                errors.append(errors_)
            elif isinstance(errors_, list):
                errors.extend(errors_)
            else:
                values[field.name] = v_

    return values, errors
```

With this corrected version, the `request_body_to_args` function should now properly handle non-typing sequences like lists, sets, and tuples extracted from the received body, ensuring correct validation and processing. The function should now pass the failing tests and return the expected output.
