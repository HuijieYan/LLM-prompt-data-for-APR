### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `request_body_to_args` is responsible for converting request body data to arguments with validation in a FastAPI application.
2. The function handles required parameters specified by the `required_params` list and the received body data `received_body`.
3. The bug seems to be related to handling non-typing sequences like lists, sets, and tuples in form data, leading to incorrect validation and status code 422 instead of the expected 200.
4. The bug is significant as it prevents correct validation for non-typing sequences in form data, affecting the overall functionality of the FastAPI application.
5. The bug is mapped to a GitHub issue related to supporting repeated key=value in form data to resolve this specific issue.

### Error Cause:
The bug causes incorrect handling of repeated key=value pairs in form data for non-typing sequences, resulting in failed validation.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Update the logic to correctly handle repeated key=value pairs in form data for non-typing sequences such as lists, sets, and tuples.
2. Ensure that values are properly extracted and interpreted for non-typing sequences during validation.
3. Modify the conditions and the way values are validated based on the type of field and the received data.

### Bug-fixed Function:
```python
async def request_body_to_args(
    required_params: List[ModelField],
    received_body: Optional[Union[Dict[str, Any], FormData]],
) -> Tuple[Dict[str, Any], List[ErrorWrapper]]:
    values = {}
    errors = []
    for field in required_params:
        value = None
        if received_body is not None:
            if field.shape in sequence_shapes and isinstance(received_body, FormData):
                value = received_body.getlist(field.alias)
            else:
                value = received_body.get(field.alias)
        
        if value is None or (isinstance(get_field_info(field), params.Form) and value == "") or \
                (isinstance(get_field_info(field), params.Form) and field.shape in sequence_shapes and len(value) == 0):
            if field.required:
                errors.append(ErrorWrapper(MissingError(), loc=("body", field.alias)))
            else:
                values[field.name] = deepcopy(field.default)
            continue
        
        if field.shape in sequence_shapes:
            v_ = value if field.type_ == list else set(value) if field.type_ == set else tuple(value)
        else:
            v_ = await field.validate(value, values, loc=("body", field.alias))
        
        if isinstance(v_, list):
            values[field.name] = v_
        else:
            values[field.name] = v_.value
        errors.extend(v_.errors())
    
    return values, errors
```

By updating the function with the corrected logic, we can address the bug and ensure proper validation for non-typing sequences in form data. This updated version should pass the failing tests and resolve the issue reported on GitHub.
