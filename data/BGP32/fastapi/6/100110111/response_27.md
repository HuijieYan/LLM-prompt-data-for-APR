### Analysis
1. The `request_body_to_args` function is designed to process request body parameters based on the required parameters and the received body. It iterates over required parameters, extracts values from the received body, and validates them.
2. The bug in the function seems to be related to handling sequence shapes in the data processing logic.
3. The failing tests are due to incorrect handling of list, set, and tuple sequences in the received body, leading to incorrect status code responses.
4. To fix the bug, we need to update the logic for handling sequence shapes in the received body.
5. The GitHub issue suggests solving a related problem about supporting repeated keys in form data.

### Bug Fix Strategy
1. Check the logic for handling sequence shapes in the received body against the expected behavior of supporting repeated keys with the same name.
2. Update the processing logic to correctly handle multiple values for the same key in the received body.
3. Run the failing tests after applying the fix to ensure the correct processing of sequence shapes and the response status codes.

### Bug-fixed Version of the Function
```python
async def request_body_to_args(
    required_params: List[ModelField],
    received_body: Optional[Union[Dict[str, Any], FormData]],
) -> Tuple[Dict[str, Any], List[ErrorWrapper]]:
    values = {}
    errors = []
    if required_params:
        for field in required_params:
            value: Any = None
            if received_body is not None:
                if field.shape in sequence_shapes and isinstance(
                    received_body, FormData
                ):
                    if field.alias in received_body:
                        if field.shape != 1:
                            value = received_body.getlist(field.alias)
                        else:
                            value = received_body.get(field.alias)
                else:
                    value = received_body.get(field.alias)
            if (
                value is None
                or (isinstance(field_info, params.Form) and value == "")
                or (
                    isinstance(field_info, params.Form)
                    and field.shape in sequence_shapes
                    and len(value) == 0
                )
            ):
                if field.required:
                    if PYDANTIC_1:
                        errors.append(
                            ErrorWrapper(MissingError(), loc=("body", field.alias))
                        )
                    else:  # pragma: nocover
                        errors.append(
                            ErrorWrapper(  # type: ignore
                                MissingError(),
                                loc=("body", field.alias),
                                config=BaseConfig,
                            )
                        )
                else:
                    values[field.name] = deepcopy(field.default)
                continue
            if (
                isinstance(field_info, params.File)
                and lenient_issubclass(field.type_, bytes)
                and isinstance(value, UploadFile)
            ):
                value = await value.read()
            elif (
                field.shape in sequence_shapes
                and isinstance(field_info, params.File)
                and lenient_issubclass(field.type_, bytes)
                and isinstance(value, sequence_types)
            ):
                awaitables = [sub_value.read() for sub_value in value]
                contents = await asyncio.gather(*awaitables)
                value = sequence_shape_to_type[field.shape](contents)
            v_, errors_ = field.validate(value, values, loc=("body", field.alias))
            if isinstance(errors_, ErrorWrapper):
                errors.append(errors_)
            elif isinstance(errors_, list):
                errors.extend(errors_)
            else:
                values[field.name] = v_
    return values, errors
```

After applying this corrected version, the function should now correctly handle the sequence shapes in the received body and resolve the issues with the failing tests related to list, set, and tuple sequences. The corrected function should align with the expected input/output values and successfully address the problem reported in the GitHub issue regarding supporting repeated keys in form data.
