### Analysis:
1. The `request_body_to_args` function is responsible for extracting values from the received body based on the required parameters' information.
2. The buggy function has issues with extracting values correctly, particularly with sequences like lists, sets, and tuples.
3. The failing tests all expect the extracted values to match the input data structure, but the function fails to handle sequences properly.
4. The GitHub issue indicates that the current behavior is not handling repeated keys correctly in form data.

### Bug Explanation:
1. The buggy function fails to handle sequences like lists, sets, and tuples correctly. It does not properly extract individual values for these sequences, leading to incorrect results.
2. When processing lists, sets, or tuples in the received body, the function does not handle them as expected, resulting in validation errors.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Modify the function to handle sequence-shaped data properly when extracting values.
2. For sequences like lists, sets, and tuples, ensure that each element inside the sequence is extracted individually and correctly.
3. Refactor the function logic to handle repeated keys in form data by collecting all values associated with a key into a list before validation.

### Updated Corrected Function:

```python
async def request_body_to_args(
    required_params: List[ModelField],
    received_body: Optional[Union[Dict[str, Any], FormData]],
) -> Tuple[Dict[str, Any], List[ErrorWrapper]]:
    values = {}
    errors = []
    for field in required_params:
        value: Any = None
        if received_body is not None:
            if field.shape in sequence_shapes and isinstance(
                received_body, FormData
            ):
                value = received_body.getlist(field.alias)
            else:
                value = received_body.get(field.alias)
        if (
            value is None
            or (isinstance(get_field_info(field), params.Form) and value == "")
            or (
                isinstance(get_field_info(field), params.Form)
                and field.shape in sequence_shapes
                and len(value) == 0
            )
        ):
            if field.required:
                if PYDANTIC_1:
                    errors.append(
                        ErrorWrapper(MissingError(), loc=("body", field.alias))
                    )
                else:  # pragma: nocover
                    errors.append(
                        ErrorWrapper(  # type: ignore
                            MissingError(),
                            loc=("body", field.alias),
                            config=BaseConfig,
                        )
                    )
            else:
                values[field.name] = deepcopy(field.default)
            continue
        if (
            isinstance(get_field_info(field), params.File)
            and lenient_issubclass(field.type_, bytes)
            and isinstance(value, UploadFile)
        ):
            value = await value.read()
        elif (
            field.shape in sequence_shapes
            and isinstance(get_field_info(field), params.File)
            and lenient_issubclass(field.type_, bytes)
            and isinstance(value, sequence_types)
        ):
            awaitables = [sub_value.read() for sub_value in value]
            contents = await asyncio.gather(*awaitables)
            value = sequence_shape_to_type[field.shape](contents)
        v_, errors_ = field.validate(value, values, loc=("body", field.alias))
        if isinstance(errors_, ErrorWrapper):
            errors.append(errors_)
        elif isinstance(errors_, list):
            errors.extend(errors_)
        else:
            values[field.name] = v_
    return values, errors
```

### Changes Made:
1. Removed the unnecessary check for a single field with no embed.
2. Modified the logic to properly handle sequences like lists, sets, and tuples by extracting individual elements from the sequence.
3. Utilized `get_field_info(field)` to retrieve the field information and handle sequence validations correctly.
4. Updated the function to handle repeated keys in form data as described in the GitHub issue by collecting values associated with a key into a list before validation.

By making these modifications, the corrected function should now accurately extract values from the received body and handle sequence-shaped data appropriately. This should resolve the failing tests and address the issue reported on GitHub.
