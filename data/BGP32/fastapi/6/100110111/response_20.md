## Analysis
1. The `request_body_to_args` function is meant to convert received request body data to arguments based on required parameters. It checks the shape of the field and processes the received body data accordingly.
2. The failing tests indicate that the function is not handling repeated keys (`items` in this case) in the form data correctly.
3. The cause of the bug seems to be related to how the function processes repeated keys in form data. It only considers the last value for a repeated key when building the arguments.
4. To fix the bug, the function needs to handle repeated keys by collecting all values for the same key and assigning them as a list before validation.
5. Below is the corrected version of the function.

## Corrected Version
```python
async def request_body_to_args(
    required_params: List[ModelField],
    received_body: Optional[Union[Dict[str, Any], FormData]],
) -> Tuple[Dict[str, Any], List[ErrorWrapper]]:
    values = {}
    errors = []
    for field in required_params:
        field_info = get_field_info(field)
        if field.alias in received_body:
            value = received_body.getlist(field.alias)
            v_, errors_ = field.validate(value, values, loc=("body", field.alias))
            if isinstance(errors_, ErrorWrapper):
                errors.append(errors_)
            elif isinstance(errors_, list):
                errors.extend(errors_)
            else:
                values[field.name] = v_
    return values, errors
```

By using `getlist` instead of `get`, the corrected function retrieves all values for a given key in form data. It then validates these values, treating them as a list when necessary. This change ensures that all values are considered for decision-making and validation.
