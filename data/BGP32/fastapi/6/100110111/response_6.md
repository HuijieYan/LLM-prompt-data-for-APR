### Potential Error Locations:
1. The conditional check and assignment of `received_body` being wrapped with `if len(required_params) == 1 and not embed:` might be causing issues with handling multiple values for the same key.
2. `value = received_body.get(field.alias)` might not handle sequences of values properly.
3. Errors could occur due to incorrect validation conditions for various field types such as `params.Form` and `params.File`.

### Cause of Bug:
The bug in the `request_body_to_args` function seems to be related to the handling of sequences in form data. Specifically, for the test cases provided, where a list, set, or tuple is being passed as form data with multiple values, the function fails to process the data correctly. The bug possibly arises from how multiple values for the same key are handled within the function, leading to incorrect value extraction and validation.

### Suggested Strategy for Fix:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the function correctly handles scenarios where form data contains sequences with multiple values for the same key. Adjustments should be made to correctly extract and process these values to ensure they are appropriately assigned and validated for the corresponding fields.

### Corrected Version of the Function:

```python
async def request_body_to_args(
    required_params: List[ModelField],
    received_body: Optional[Union[Dict[str, Any], FormData]],
) -> Tuple[Dict[str, Any], List[ErrorWrapper]]:
    values = {}
    errors = []
    if required_params:
        for field in required_params:
            if received_body is not None:
                values[field.name] = []
                if field.shape in sequence_shapes and isinstance(received_body, FormData):
                    values[field.name] = received_body.getlist(field.alias)
                else:
                    value = received_body.get(field.alias)
                    if value is not None:
                        values[field.name].append(value)
            if not values[field.name]:
                if field.required:
                    errors.append(ErrorWrapper(MissingError(), loc=("body", field.alias)))
                else:
                    values[field.name] = deepcopy(field.default)
            for i, val in enumerate(values[field.name]):
                if isinstance(field_info, params.File) and lenient_issubclass(field.type_, bytes) and isinstance(val, UploadFile):
                    values[field.name][i] = await val.read()
            v_, errors_ = field.validate(values[field.name], values, loc=("body", field.alias))
            if isinstance(errors_, ErrorWrapper):
                errors.append(errors_)
            elif isinstance(errors_, list):
                errors.extend(errors_)
            else:
                values[field.name] = v_
    return values, errors
```

In this corrected version:
1. The function now correctly handles sequences in form data by extracting values for the same key into a list.
2. Values from the form data are correctly stored in the `values` dictionary with proper key associations.
3. The validation process now processes each value individually in sequences to ensure correct validation behavior is maintained.

By applying these changes, the corrected function should now be able to handle sequences in form data properly and pass the failing test cases while aligning with the expected input/output values.
