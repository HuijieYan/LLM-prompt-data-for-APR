### Analysis
1. The buggy function `request_body_to_args` is responsible for converting a request body into a dictionary of values based on required parameters.
2. The bug seems to be related to handling repeated keys in form data, causing validation issues for keys with multiple values.
3. The failing tests indicate that the function is not correctly parsing and processing form data with repeated keys.
4. The GitHub issue points out the problem of handling repeated key=value pairs in form data, which aligns with the failing tests.

### Bug Cause
The bug in the function is due to the way it processes form data with repeated keys. It currently only considers the last value associated with a key, leading to incorrect behavior when dealing with keys that have multiple values.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix this bug and align with the expected behavior described in the GitHub issue, the function should be modified to handle repeated keys and aggregate their values appropriately before validation.

### Corrected Function
Here is the corrected version of the `request_body_to_args` function:

```python
async def request_body_to_args(
    required_params: List[ModelField],
    received_body: Optional[Union[Dict[str, Any], FormData]],
) -> Tuple[Dict[str, Any], List[ErrorWrapper]]:
    values = {}
    errors = []
    for field in required_params:
        value = []
        if received_body is not None:
            if field.shape in sequence_shapes and isinstance(received_body, FormData):
                values_list = received_body.getlist(field.alias)
                value.extend(values_list)
            else:
                value = received_body.get(field.alias)

        v_ = value
        errors_ = []
        
        if value is None or (isinstance(field_info, params.Form) and value == ""):
            if field.required:
                if PYDANTIC_1:
                    errors.append(ErrorWrapper(MissingError(), loc=("body", field.alias)))
                else:
                    errors.append(ErrorWrapper(MissingError(), loc=("body", field.alias), config=BaseConfig))
            values[field.alias] = deepcopy(field.default)
        else:
            v_, errors_ = field.validate(v_, values, loc=("body", field.alias))

        if isinstance(errors_, ErrorWrapper):
            errors.append(errors_)
        elif isinstance(errors_, list):
            errors.extend(errors_)
        else:
            values[field.alias] = v_
    
    return values, errors
```

With this corrected version, the function now accumulates values for repeated keys correctly and validates them accordingly. This fix should resolve the issues seen in the failing tests and align with the expected behavior specified in the GitHub issue.
