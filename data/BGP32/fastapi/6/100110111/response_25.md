### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `request_body_to_args` is responsible for converting received body data into arguments based on the required parameters.
2. The function checks for required parameters and processes them accordingly.
3. The function has issues with handling sequence shapes and form data, leading to incorrect processing of input data, resulting in the failing tests.
4. The failing tests are due to the function not correctly handling sequence shapes like lists, sets, and tuples in form data and extracting values properly.
5. The failing tests are related to different sequence shapes being passed as form data, leading to incorrect status code responses.

### Bug Cause:
1. The function does not properly handle sequence shapes like lists, sets, and tuples in form data.
2. Incorrect processing of form data values, especially with respect to sequence shapes, leading to incorrect handling of input data.
3. Missing validation and extraction steps for sequence shapes within form data.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Identify the sequence shapes correctly within the form data and extract the values accordingly.
2. Update the retrieval logic to handle different sequence shapes properly.
3. Ensure that the function processes form data accurately for different parameter types.
4. Validate and extract values for sequence shapes in form data before validation occurs.

### Bug-fixed Function:
```python
async def request_body_to_args(
    required_params: List[ModelField],
    received_body: Optional[Union[Dict[str, Any], FormData]],
) -> Tuple[Dict[str, Any], List[ErrorWrapper]]:
    values = {}
    errors = []
    
    if required_params:
        for field in required_params:
            field_info = get_field_info(field)
            value: Any = None
            if received_body is not None:
                if field.shape in sequence_shapes and isinstance(received_body, FormData):
                    if field.alias in received_body:
                        value = received_body.getlist(field.alias)
                else:
                    value = received_body.get(field.alias)
            
            if value is None or (
                isinstance(field_info, params.Form) and field.shape in sequence_shapes and len(value) == 0
            ):
                if field.required:
                    errors.append(
                        ErrorWrapper(MissingError(), loc=("body", field.alias))
                    )
                else:
                    values[field.name] = deepcopy(field.default)
                continue
            
            if (
                isinstance(field_info, params.File)
                and lenient_issubclass(field.type_, bytes)
                and isinstance(value, UploadFile)
            ):
                value = await value.read()
            elif (
                field.shape in sequence_shapes
                and isinstance(field_info, params.File)
                and lenient_issubclass(field.type_, bytes)
                and isinstance(value, sequence_types)
            ):
                awaitables = [sub_value.read() for sub_value in value]
                contents = await asyncio.gather(*awaitables)
                value = sequence_shape_to_type[field.shape](contents)
                
            v_, errors_ = field.validate(value, values, loc=("body", field.alias))
            if isinstance(errors_, ErrorWrapper):
                errors.append(errors_)
            elif isinstance(errors_, list):
                errors.extend(errors_)
            else:
                values[field.name] = v_
    
    return values, errors
```

After applying the fix, the function should correctly handle different sequence shapes within form data and extract values accordingly, resolving the failing tests and satisfying the expected input/output values and GitHub issue requirements.
