### Analysis:
1. The `request_body_to_args` function is intended to process incoming request body parameters and convert them to a dictionary while performing validations and error handling.
2. The function fails to handle the case where multiple values are associated with the same key in a form data request. This issue is directly related to the failing test cases where the expected output does not match the actual output due to this limitation.
3. The cause of the bug lies in how the function processes incoming form data when multiple values are associated with the same key. The function only considers the last value associated with the key instead of aggregating all values into a list.
4. To fix the bug, the function needs to be updated to handle the scenario where multiple values are associated with the same key in form data requests. Before returning the values dictionary, a check should be added to check for repeated keys and combine their values into a list.
5. The corrected version of the function is provided below:

### Corrected Function:
```python
async def request_body_to_args(
    required_params: List[ModelField],
    received_body: Optional[Union[Dict[str, Any], FormData]],
) -> Tuple[Dict[str, Any], List[ErrorWrapper]]:
    values = {}
    errors = []
    
    if received_body is not None and isinstance(received_body, FormData):
        form_data = {}
        for key, value in received_body.items():
            if key not in form_data:
                form_data[key] = [value]
            else:
                form_data[key].append(value)
        
        received_body = {}
        for key, value in form_data.items():
            if len(value) == 1:
                received_body[key] = value[0]
            else:
                received_body[key] = value
    
    if required_params:
        field = required_params[0]
        field_info = get_field_info(field)
        embed = getattr(field_info, "embed", None)
        
        if len(required_params) == 1 and not embed:
            received_body = {field.alias: received_body}
        
        for field in required_params:
            value: Any = None
            if received_body is not None:
                if field.shape in sequence_shapes and isinstance(
                    received_body, FormData
                ):
                    value = received_body.getlist(field.alias)
                else:
                    value = received_body.get(field.alias)
            
            # Remaining code remains the same
            
    return values, errors
```

### Explanation:
1. The corrected function now properly handles the case where multiple values are associated with the same key in form data requests.
2. It aggregates all values associated with the same key into a list before returning the processed values dictionary.
3. The function now correctly processes and validates form data with repeated keys, addressing the issue mentioned in the GitHub problem statement.
4. The corrected function should now pass the failing test cases and provide the expected output as described in the test cases' expectations.
