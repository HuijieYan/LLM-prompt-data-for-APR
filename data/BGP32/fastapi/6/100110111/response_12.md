The buggy function `request_body_to_args` is causing issues in processing and validating form data for FastAPI endpoints. The function fails to handle cases where multiple values with the same key are present in the form data. This leads to validation errors and incorrect behavior in the tests provided.

### Potential Error Locations:
1. The section where `value` is extracted from the `received_body` does not handle cases with repeated keys properly.
2. Handling of values for repeated keys needs to be improved, and the validation logic should be updated accordingly.

### Cause of the Bug:
The bug in the function lies in the way it handles form data with repeated keys. When multiple values are present for the same key in the form data, the function wrongly assigns only the last value to the corresponding field, leading to validation errors and unexpected behavior in the tests.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Modify the logic for extracting values from the `received_body` to correctly handle repeated keys and store values accordingly.
2. Update the validation process to consider all values associated with repeated keys during the validation step.

### Bug-Free Version of the Function
Here is the corrected version of the `request_body_to_args` function that addresses the issues mentioned:

```python
async def request_body_to_args(
    required_params: List[ModelField],
    received_body: Optional[Union[Dict[str, Any], FormData]],
) -> Tuple[Dict[str, Any], List[ErrorWrapper]]:
    values = {}
    errors = []
    if required_params:
        for field in required_params:
            value: Any = None
            if received_body is not None:
                if field.shape in sequence_shapes and isinstance(
                    received_body, FormData
                ):
                    values[field.alias] = received_body.getlist(field.alias)
                else:
                    values[field.alias] = received_body.getlist(field.alias)
            if field.alias not in values:
                if field.required:
                    if PYDANTIC_1:
                        errors.append(
                            ErrorWrapper(MissingError(), loc=("body", field.alias))
                        )
                    else:
                        errors.append(
                            ErrorWrapper(
                                MissingError(), loc=("body", field.alias), config=BaseConfig
                            )
                        )
                else:
                    values[field.alias] = deepcopy(field.default)
            else:
                v_, errors_ = field.validate(values[field.alias], values, loc=("body", field.alias))
                if isinstance(errors_, ErrorWrapper):
                    errors.append(errors_)
                elif isinstance(errors_, list):
                    errors.extend(errors_)
                else:
                    values[field.name] = v_

    return values, errors
```

By updating the logic to handle repeated keys properly and ensuring that values are stored and validated correctly, the corrected function should now pass the failing tests and satisfy the expected input/output values.
