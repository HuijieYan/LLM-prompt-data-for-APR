### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `request_body_to_args` is intended to extract values from a request body and validate them against required parameters. It processes the received body data based on the required parameters' information and populates `values` with validated values and `errors` with any validation errors encountered.
2. The potential error locations in the function could be related to processing sequence shapes, file uploads, validation, and handling missing values.
3. The cause of the bug can be attributed to improper handling of sequences (lists, sets, tuples) in the received body data, leading to validation errors and incorrect output values. The failing tests indicate that issue revolves around processing non-typing sequences like lists, sets, and tuples from form data.
4. To fix the bug, the function needs to correctly handle the case where a single field has multiple values in the form data. It should aggregate these values into a list, set, or tuple before validation. Additionally, handling file uploads, validation, and missing values should be revised where necessary.
5. Below is the corrected version of the `request_body_to_args` function:

### Corrected Version:
```python
async def request_body_to_args(
    required_params: List[ModelField],
    received_body: Optional[Union[Dict[str, Any], FormData]],
) -> Tuple[Dict[str, Any], List[ErrorWrapper]]:
    values = {}
    errors = []
    
    if required_params:
        for field in required_params:
            value = None
            if received_body is not None:
                alias = field.alias
                if field.shape in sequence_shapes and isinstance(received_body, FormData):
                    if alias in received_body:
                        value = received_body.getlist(alias)
                else:
                    value = received_body.get(alias, None)
                
            if value is None or (isinstance(get_field_info(field), params.Form) and value == "") or (isinstance(get_field_info(field), params.Form) and field.shape in sequence_shapes and len(value) == 0):
                if field.required:
                    errors.append(ErrorWrapper(MissingError(), loc=("body", field.alias)))
                else:
                    values[field.name] = deepcopy(field.default)
            else:
                if isinstance(field_info, params.File) and lenient_issubclass(field.type_, bytes) and isinstance(value, UploadFile):
                    value = await value.read()
                elif field.shape in sequence_shapes and isinstance(field_info, params.File) and lenient_issubclass(field.type_, bytes) and isinstance(value, sequence_types):
                    awaitables = [sub_value.read() for sub_value in value]
                    contents = await asyncio.gather(*awaitables)
                    value = sequence_shape_to_type[field.shape](contents)
                
                v_, errors_ = field.validate(value, values, loc=("body", field.alias))
                if isinstance(errors_, ErrorWrapper):
                    errors.append(errors_)
                elif isinstance(errors_, list):
                    errors.extend(errors_)
                else:
                    values[field.alias] = v_
    
    return values, errors
```

By updating the `request_body_to_args` function as shown above, the function should be able to properly handle non-typing sequences from form data and resolve the validation issues observed in the failing tests.
