### Analysis

The buggy function `request_body_to_args` is responsible for converting request data into arguments for FastAPI endpoints. The function processes required parameters and received body data to extract values and handle validations, returning a dictionary of values and a list of error wrappers.

The failing tests provided demonstrate issues related to processing list, set, and tuple data provided in the form data. The tests send data in different formats, but the function fails to handle them correctly, resulting in incorrect HTTP status codes and failed assertions.

The GitHub issue linked to the bug suggests that the problem lies in how repeated keys in form data are handled. Currently, only the last key-value pair is considered, leading to incorrect behavior when trying to work with sequences in the request data.

### Issue in the Buggy Function

The main issue in the `request_body_to_args` function is around handling repeated keys in form data for sequences. The function is not correctly processing list, set, and tuple data passed as form values, leading to failed validations and wrong outputs.

The primary errors in the function include:
1. Incorrect handling of repeated keys for sequence-like parameters.
2. Inadequate parsing and validation logic for varying data types.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug

To resolve the issues in the `request_body_to_args` function, the handling of repeated form keys and the processing of list, set, and tuple data types need to be corrected. Specifically:
1. Detect and handle repeated keys in form data, collecting them into a list for sequence-like parameters.
2. Update the value extraction and validation logic to support different sequence shapes properly.

By addressing these issues, we can ensure that the function correctly processes form data containing sequences and handles validations accurately.

### Corrected Version of the Function

Below is the corrected version of the `request_body_to_args` function addressing the identified issues:

```python
async def request_body_to_args(
    required_params: List[ModelField],
    received_body: Optional[Union[Dict[str, Any], FormData]],
) -> Tuple[Dict[str, Any], List[ErrorWrapper]]:
    values = {}
    errors = []
    if required_params:
        for field in required_params:
            values[field.name] = await extract_value(field, received_body)
            v_, errors_ = field.validate(values[field.name], values, loc=("body", field.alias))
            if isinstance(errors_, ErrorWrapper):
                errors.append(errors_)
            elif isinstance(errors_, list):
                errors.extend(errors_)
            else:
                values[field.name] = v_
    return values, errors

async def extract_value(field: ModelField, received_body: Optional[Union[Dict[str, Any], FormData]]) -> Any:
    value = None
    if received_body is not None:
        if field.alias in received_body:
            raw_value = received_body[field.alias]
            if field.shape in sequence_shapes:
                if not isinstance(raw_value, list):
                    raw_value = [raw_value]
            value = await prepare_value(field, raw_value)
    if value is None:
        value = deepcopy(field.default) if not field.required else None
    
    return value

async def prepare_value(field: ModelField, raw_value: Union[Any, List[Any]]) -> Any:
    if isinstance(field_info, params.File):
        if isinstance(field.type_, bytes):
            if isinstance(raw_value, UploadFile):
                return await raw_value.read()
            elif isinstance(raw_value, list) and all(isinstance(item, UploadFile) for item in raw_value):
                return [await item.read() for item in raw_value]
    return raw_value
```

This corrected version introduces helper functions to improve modularization and clarity. The `extract_value` function handles the extraction of values from the received body, correctly processing sequence-like data by converting single entries to lists. The `prepare_value` function takes care of preparing values for files, reading their contents if necessary.

By implementing these changes, the function should now handle form data containing sequences correctly, enabling the tests to pass as expected and resolving the issue described in the GitHub report.
