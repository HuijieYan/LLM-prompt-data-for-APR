### Issue Analysis
1. The buggy function `request_body_to_args` is responsible for converting the received body data into arguments for FastAPI endpoints' dependencies.
2. The failing test cases indicate that the function is not handling list, set, and tuple input types correctly, leading to status code 422 errors.
3. The core issue seems to be with how the function processes repeating keys in Form Data and assigns values to fields for validation.
4. The GitHub issue suggests that the current behavior does not support collecting repeated keys in form data which could be the root cause of the bug.

### Bug Explanation
1. In the failing test cases, when receiving data with repeated keys in the form (e.g., `data={"items": ["first", "second", "third"]}`), the function fails to process this properly.
2. The function does not properly handle repeated keys in form data, leading to incorrect processing and validation errors (status code 422).
3. This bug prevents the function from correctly extracting values for list, set, and tuple types from the form data and hence fails the validation process.

### Bug Fix Strategy
1. Update the `request_body_to_args` function to correctly handle repeated keys in form data for list, set, and tuple types.
2. Modify the logic to aggregate values for repeated keys into a single list, set, or tuple before validation to ensure correct processing.
3. Incorporate a solution to support collecting repeated keys in form data as suggested in the GitHub issue to address the core problem.

### Corrected Function
```python
async def request_body_to_args(
    required_params: List[ModelField],
    received_body: Optional[Union[Dict[str, Any], FormData]],
) -> Tuple[Dict[str, Any], List[ErrorWrapper]]:
    values = {}
    errors = []
    if required_params:
        for field in required_params:
            raw_values = []
            if received_body is not None:
                raw_values = received_body.getlist(field.alias)
                if not raw_values:
                    raw_values.append(received_body.get(field.alias))
            cleaned_values = [x for x in raw_values if x is not None]
            if cleaned_values:
                if (
                    isinstance(field, ModelField)
                    and field.sub_fields
                    and field.shape in sequence_shapes
                ):
                    values[field.name] = sequence_shape_to_type[field.shape](cleaned_values)
                else:
                    v_, errors_ = field.validate(cleaned_values, values, loc=("body", field.alias))
                    if isinstance(errors_, ErrorWrapper):
                        errors.append(errors_)
                    elif isinstance(errors_, list):
                        errors.extend(errors_)
                    else:
                        values[field.name] = v_
            elif field.required:
                errors.append(ErrorWrapper(MissingError(), loc=("body", field.alias)))
            else:
                values[field.name] = deepcopy(field.default)
    return values, errors
```

By updating the function as shown above, it should now correctly process repeated keys in form data for list, set, and tuple types and handle the validation process without errors. This fix should address the failing test cases and align with the expected input/output values provided.
