### Analysis
The buggy function `request_body_to_args` is responsible for converting received data from a request body into corresponding arguments based on required parameters. The function iterates over each required parameter, extracts the corresponding value from the received body, validates it, and populates the values and errors lists accordingly.

The failing tests related to `test_python_list_param_as_form`, `test_python_set_param_as_form`, and `test_python_tuple_param_as_form` indicate that the function is not handling sequences properly. In each case, the function fails to process the received data correctly, leading to validation errors and a status code of 422 instead of the expected 200.

The expected output values and types for the function reveal that the function should accurately process the received form data and populate the values dictionary with the correct values. This is essential for the function to return the expected data and pass the tests.

### Bug Explanation
The cause of the bug lies in how the function handles the received form data, especially when the data is a sequence (list, set, tuple). The current implementation of the function does not correctly process sequences, leading to validation errors and incorrect results.

When processing sequences, the function should extract each item from the form data and ensure that it handles all items correctly, maintaining the sequence structure in the final values dictionary. However, the current implementation does not account for this, causing the reported issues with sequence handling.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, the function needs to be updated to accurately handle sequences in the received form data. This involves iterating over sequence items and correctly processing them based on their type (list, set, tuple) while ensuring proper validation and population of the values dictionary.

The fix should involve updating the logic within the function that deals with sequence shapes and file values to accurately process sequence data. By correctly handling sequences, the function should be able to pass the failing tests and return the expected output values without validation errors.

### Corrected Version
Here is the corrected version of the `request_body_to_args` function:

```python
async def request_body_to_args(
    required_params: List[ModelField],
    received_body: Optional[Union[Dict[str, Any], FormData]],
) -> Tuple[Dict[str, Any], List[ErrorWrapper]]:
    values = {}
    errors = []

    if required_params:
        for field in required_params:
            alias = field.alias
            value = None

            if received_body is not None:
                if isinstance(received_body, FormData):
                    value = received_body.getlist(alias) if field.shape in sequence_shapes else received_body.get(alias)

            if value is None or (isinstance(field_info, params.Form) and (not value or value == [""])):
                if field.required:
                    errors.append(
                        ErrorWrapper(MissingError(), loc=("body", alias))
                    )
                else:
                    values[field.name] = deepcopy(field.default)
            else:
                if field_info.embed and lenient_issubclass(field.type_, bytes):
                    if field.shape in sequence_shapes:
                        awaitables = [item.read() for item in value]
                        contents = await asyncio.gather(*awaitables)
                        value = sequence_shape_to_type[field.shape](contents)
                    else:
                        if isinstance(value, UploadFile):
                            value = await value.read()

                v, error = field.validate(value, values, loc=("body", alias))
                
                if isinstance(error, ErrorWrapper):
                    errors.append(error)
                elif isinstance(error, list):
                    errors.extend(error)
                else:
                    values[field.name] = v

    return values, errors
```

In the corrected version, the function iterates correctly over the required params, handles sequence values based on the sequence shape, and appropriately validates and populates the values dictionary. This should resolve the issues reported in the failing tests and align with the expected output values for the function.
