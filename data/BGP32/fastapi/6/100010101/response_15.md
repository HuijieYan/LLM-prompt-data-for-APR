### Bug Analysis:
The buggy function `request_body_to_args` is responsible for extracting values from the received body based on required parameters and converting those values to the appropriate types. The function checks for different conditions, such as handling file uploads, empty values, and validation.

The bug seems to be related to how the function handles sequences like lists, sets, and tuples when parsing the received body. The function incorrectly processes the values for sequences, leading to the wrong values being extracted and causing the test failures.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the function correctly handles sequences (lists, sets, tuples) in the received body. We should extract values from the body based on the type of sequence expected and create the corresponding final value to be validated and returned.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
async def request_body_to_args(
    required_params: List[ModelField],
    received_body: Optional[Union[Dict[str, Any], FormData]],
) -> Tuple[Dict[str, Any], List[ErrorWrapper]]:
    values = {}
    errors = []
    sequence_shapes = {1, 2, 3}
    sequence_types = (list, set, tuple)

    if required_params:
        field = required_params[0]
        field_info = get_field_info(field)
        embed = getattr(field_info, "embed", None)

        if len(required_params) == 1 and not embed:
            received_body = {field.alias: received_body}

        for field in required_params:
            value: Any = None

            if received_body is not None:
                if field.shape in sequence_shapes and isinstance(received_body, FormData):
                    value = received_body.getlist(field.alias)
                else:
                    value = received_body.get(field.alias)

            if value is None or (isinstance(field_info, params.Form) and value == ""):
                if field.required:
                    errors.append(ErrorWrapper(MissingError(), loc=("body", field.alias)))
                else:
                    values[field.name] = deepcopy(field.default)
                continue

            if (
                field.shape in sequence_shapes
                and isinstance(field_info, params.Form)
                and lenient_issubclass(field.type_, sequence_types)
            ):
                value = sequence_types(field.validate(sub_value, values, loc=("body", field.alias))[0] for sub_value in value)

            if isinstance(field_info, params.File) and lenient_issubclass(field.type_, bytes) and isinstance(value, UploadFile):
                value = await value.read()

            v_, errors_ = field.validate(value, values, loc=("body", field.alias))

            if isinstance(errors_, ErrorWrapper):
                errors.append(errors_)
            elif isinstance(errors_, list):
                errors.extend(errors_)
            else:
                values[field.name] = v_

    return values, errors
```

The corrected function now properly handles sequences from the received body, ensuring that lists, sets, and tuples are processed correctly based on the expected type. This should resolve the issues causing the test failures and provide the expected output for different sequence types.
