## Bug Analysis
The buggy function `request_body_to_args` is designed to extract values from a request body based on provided model fields and return any errors encountered during the process. The function seems to be incorrectly handling the case when dealing with sequence shapes (like lists, sets, tuples) in request bodies.

The bug likely arises from how the function processes sequence shapes (lists, sets, tuples) in the request body, leading to incorrect extraction of values and potential errors. This discrepancy explains why the tests are failing with a status code of 422 instead of the expected 200.

### Bug Cause
1. The function does not handle sequence shapes properly when extracting values from the request body.
2. Sequences like lists, sets, and tuples are not being processed correctly, leading to errors and incorrect values being stored.

### Bug Fix Strategy
1. Update the logic related to handling sequence shapes in the request body to correctly extract values.
2. Ensure that the extracted values are properly validated and stored before returning.

### Corrected Version of the Function
Here is the corrected version of the `request_body_to_args` function:

```python
async def request_body_to_args(
    required_params: List[ModelField],
    received_body: Optional[Union[Dict[str, Any], FormData]],
) -> Tuple[Dict[str, Any], List[ErrorWrapper]]:
    values = {}
    errors = []
    
    sequence_shapes = {1}  # Define the shape for sequence types
    sequence_types = {list, set, tuple}  # Define accepted sequence types

    for field in required_params:
        if field.alias in received_body:
            value = received_body[field.alias]
            
            field_info = get_field_info(field)
            embed = getattr(field_info, "embed", None)
            
            if embed:
                value = [value]  # Wrap single values in a list for non-sequence shapes
                
            if isinstance(value, sequence_types) and field.shape in sequence_shapes:
                value = list(value)  # Convert sequence shapes to lists for consistent processing
                
            if isinstance(field_info, params.File) and lenient_issubclass(field.type_, bytes):
                if isinstance(value, UploadFile):
                    value = await value.read()
                elif isinstance(value, sequence_types):
                    awaitables = [sub_value.read() for sub_value in value]
                    value = [await sub_value for sub_value in asyncio.as_completed(awaitables)]

            v_, errors_ = field.validate(value, values, loc=("body", field.alias))
            
            if isinstance(errors_, ErrorWrapper):
                errors.append(errors_)
            elif isinstance(errors_, list):
                errors.extend(errors_)
            else:
                values[field.name] = v_

    return values, errors
```

This corrected version ensures that values from sequence shapes are properly processed and stored before final validation and error identification.
