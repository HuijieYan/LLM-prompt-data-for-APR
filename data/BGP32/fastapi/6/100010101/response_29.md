The buggy function `request_body_to_args` is designed to take a list of required parameters and a received body (either a dictionary or FormData) as input. It processes the received body data to extract values for each required parameter and validate them accordingly. However, the issue arises when the received data is not correctly handled for non-typing sequences like lists, sets, and tuples, causing the function to return incorrect results.

The identified potential error locations are:
1. The logic surrounding how the received body is processed and assigned to a specific field.
2. Handling sequence shapes and their specific processing based on the input data type.
3. The validation and extraction of values for each field.

The cause of the bug is that the code does not handle non-typing sequences like lists, sets, and tuples correctly when processing the received body data. This results in incorrect values being extracted and validated for these types, leading to the failing test cases.

To fix the bug:
1. Update the logic for how the received body data is processed for non-typing sequences like lists, sets, and tuples.
2. Ensure that the correct values are extracted and validated for each field based on the input data type.

Here is the corrected version of the `request_body_to_args` function:

```python
async def request_body_to_args(
    required_params: List[ModelField],
    received_body: Optional[Union[Dict[str, Any], FormData]],
) -> Tuple[Dict[str, Any], List[ErrorWrapper]]:
    values = {}
    errors = []
    if required_params:
        for field in required_params:
            value: Any = None
            if received_body is not None:
                if isinstance(received_body, FormData):
                    value = received_body.getlist(field.alias)
                else:
                    value = received_body.get(field.alias)
            if (
                value is None
                or (isinstance(get_field_info(field), params.Form) and value == "")
                or (
                    isinstance(get_field_info(field), params.Form)
                    and isinstance(field.type_, Sequence)
                    and len(value) == 0
                )
            ):
                if field.required:
                    errors.append(ErrorWrapper(MissingError(), loc=("body", field.alias))
                else:
                    values[field.name] = deepcopy(field.default)
                continue

            if isinstance(get_field_info(field), params.File) and \
                    lenient_issubclass(field.type_, bytes) and isinstance(value, UploadFile):
                value = await value.read()
            
            v_, errors_ = field.validate(value, values, loc=("body", field.alias))
            if isinstance(errors_, ErrorWrapper):
                errors.append(errors_)
            elif isinstance(errors_, list):
                errors.extend(errors_)
            else:
                values[field.name] = v_
    return values, errors
```

This corrected version should now properly handle non-typing sequences like lists, sets, and tuples in the input data, allowing the function to return the correct values for the specified parameters.
