### Analyzing the Buggy Function and Error Message

The buggy function `request_body_to_args` is responsible for converting incoming request body data into arguments for FastAPI path operations. The error message indicates that the expected HTTP status code of `200` is not being returned, instead, it returns status code `422`, which typically signifies an issue with validation errors.

The function extracts values from the incoming request body based on the required parameters defined and creates a dictionary of values and a list of errors. The error could be related to how the function handles sequences in the request body.

### Identified Bug

The bug might be in the way the function is handling sequences like lists, sets, and tuples in the request body. The function doesn't correctly handle the case where an attribute is represented multiple times in a FormData object when dealing with sequences. This causes the value extraction and validation process to go wrong, leading to validation errors.

### Bug Fix Strategy

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the function correctly handles sequences within the request body. Specifically, we need to address how repeated attributes are processed when dealing with sequences like lists, sets, and tuples.

### Corrected Version of the Function

Here is the corrected version of the `request_body_to_args` function:

```python
async def request_body_to_args(
    required_params: List[ModelField],
    received_body: Optional[Union[Dict[str, Any], FormData]],
) -> Tuple[Dict[str, Any], List[ErrorWrapper]]:
    values = {}
    errors = []
    
    if required_params:
        main_field = required_params[0]
        embed = getattr(get_field_info(main_field), "embed", None)

        if len(required_params) == 1 and not embed:
            received_body = {main_field.alias: received_body.getlist(main_field.alias)}

        for field in required_params:
            value: Any = None

            if received_body is not None:
                if main_field.shape in sequence_shapes and isinstance(received_body, FormData):
                    value = received_body.getlist(field.alias)
                else:
                    value = received_body.get(field.alias)

            if value is None or (isinstance(get_field_info(field), params.Form) and value == ""):
                if field.required:
                    errors.append(ErrorWrapper(MissingError(), loc=("body", field.alias))
                else:
                    values[field.name] = deepcopy(field.default)
            else:
                if isinstance(get_field_info(field), params.File) and lenient_issubclass(field.type_, bytes) and isinstance(value, UploadFile):
                    value = await value.read()
                elif field.shape in sequence_shapes and isinstance(get_field_info(field), params.File) and lenient_issubclass(field.type_, bytes) and isinstance(value, sequence_types):
                    awaitables = [sub_value.read() for sub_value in value]
                    contents = await asyncio.gather(*awaitables)
                    value = sequence_shape_to_type[field.shape](contents)
                v_, errors_ = field.validate(value, values, loc=("body", field.alias))

                if isinstance(errors_, ErrorWrapper):
                    errors.append(errors_)
                elif isinstance(errors_, list):
                    errors.extend(errors_)
                else:
                    values[field.name] = v_

    return values, errors
```

By updating the processing logic to correctly handle sequences within the request body and addressing how repeated attributes should be handled, the corrected version should address the validation errors and ensure that the expected HTTP status code of `200` is returned for the provided test cases.
