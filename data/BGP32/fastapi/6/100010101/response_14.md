### Analysis:
1. The function is supposed to convert the received HTTP request body into arguments that match the required parameters.
2. The failing tests indicate that the function is returning a status code of 422 (validation error) instead of the expected status code of 200.
3. The function seems to have a bug in handling non-typing sequences like lists, sets, and tuples when received as form data.
4. The bug is likely related to how the function processes and validates non-list sequences like sets and tuples.

### Bug Explanation:
- In the buggy function, when a non-typing sequence such as a list, set, or tuple is received as form data, it tries to extract the value for the field key. However, the validation logic does not correctly handle these non-list sequence shapes.
- This leads to a validation error and the returned status code being 422 ('Unprocessable Entity') instead of the expected code of 200 ('OK').

### Bug Fix Strategy:
- Modify the function to properly handle non-list sequence shapes by extracting values differently based on the type of sequence being processed.
- Ensure that the validation process is appropriately applied to non-list sequence shapes without raising unnecessary errors.

### Corrected Function:
```python
async def request_body_to_args(
    required_params: List[ModelField],
    received_body: Optional[Union[Dict[str, Any], FormData]],
) -> Tuple[Dict[str, Any], List[ErrorWrapper]]:
    values = {}
    errors = []
    if required_params:
        field = required_params[0]
        field_info = get_field_info(field)
        embed = getattr(field_info, "embed", None)
        if len(required_params) == 1 and not embed:
            received_body = {field.alias: received_body}
        for field in required_params:
            value: Any = None
            if received_body is not None:
                if field.shape in sequence_shapes and isinstance(
                    received_body, FormData
                ):
                    # Modified the value extraction logic for non-list sequence shapes
                    if field.shape == 1:  # List
                        value = received_body.getlist(field.alias)
                    elif field.shape == 3:  # Set
                        value = set(received_body.getlist(field.alias))
                    elif field.shape == 2:  # Tuple
                        value = tuple(received_body.getlist(field.alias))
                else:
                    value = received_body.get(field.alias)
            if (
                value is None
                or (isinstance(field_info, params.Form) and value == "")
                or (
                    isinstance(field_info, params.Form)
                    and field.shape in sequence_shapes
                    and len(value) == 0
                )
            ):
                # Validation for required fields
                if field.required:
                    errors.append(
                        ErrorWrapper(MissingError(), loc=("body", field.alias))
                    )
                else:
                    values[field.name] = deepcopy(field.default)
                continue
            if (
                isinstance(field_info, params.File)
                and lenient_issubclass(field.type_, bytes)
                and isinstance(value, UploadFile)
            ):
                value = await value.read()
            elif (
                field.shape in sequence_shapes
                and isinstance(field_info, params.File)
                and lenient_issubclass(field.type_, bytes)
                and isinstance(value, sequence_types)
            ):
                awaitables = [sub_value.read() for sub_value in value]
                contents = await asyncio.gather(*awaitables)
                value = sequence_shape_to_type[field.shape](contents)
            v_, errors_ = field.validate(value, values, loc=("body", field.alias))
            if isinstance(errors_, ErrorWrapper):
                errors.append(errors_)
            elif isinstance(errors_, list):
                errors.extend(errors_)
            else:
                values[field.name] = v_
    return values, errors
```

By incorporating the modifications mentioned in the corrected function above, the bug should be fixed, and the function should return the expected HTTP status code of 200 for the provided test cases.
