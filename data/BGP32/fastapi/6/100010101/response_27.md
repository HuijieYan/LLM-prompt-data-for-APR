### Analysis
The buggy function `request_body_to_args` is intended to convert received body data into arguments based on required parameters. It is primarily designed to handle various shapes of parameters such as sequences and file uploads.

The bug arises when handling form data for sequences like lists, sets, and tuples. The current implementation fails to correctly parse and assign values for these types of parameters, resulting in validation errors.

### Bug Explanation
1. When receiving form data for non-typing sequences such as lists, sets, and tuples, the values are not correctly extracted and validated. This results in the function returning validation errors even when the data provided is valid.

2. The logic for handling sequence shapes within the form data is incorrect, leading to improper extraction and validation of values from the form data.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug:
1. Adjust the logic for extracting values from form data for sequence shapes.
2. Ensure that the validation of these sequence shapes is correctly handled.
3. Update the way values are assigned and validated for non-typing sequences like lists, sets, and tuples.

### Corrected Function
```python
async def request_body_to_args(
    required_params: List[ModelField],
    received_body: Optional[Union[Dict[str, Any], FormData]],
) -> Tuple[Dict[str, Any], List[ErrorWrapper]]:
    values = {}
    errors = []
    sequence_shapes = {1, 2, 3}
    sequence_types = (list, set, tuple)
    sequence_shape_to_type = {1: list, 2: set, 3: tuple}

    if required_params:
        field = required_params[0]
        field_info = get_field_info(field)
        embed = getattr(field_info, "embed", None)
        if len(required_params) == 1 and not embed:
            received_body = {field.alias: received_body}

        for field in required_params:
            value: Any = None
            if received_body is not None:
                if field.shape in sequence_shapes:
                    value = received_body.getlist(field.alias)
                else:
                    value = received_body.get(field.alias)

            if value is None or not value:
                if field.required:
                    errors.append(ErrorWrapper(MissingError(), loc=("body", field.alias))
                else:
                    values[field.name] = deepcopy(field.default)
                continue

            if isinstance(field_info, params.File) and lenient_issubclass(field.type_, bytes):
                if isinstance(value, list):  # Process each item in the list
                    value = [await sub_value.read() for sub_value in value]
                elif isinstance(value, sequence_types):  # Process single item like set or tuple
                    value = await value.read()

            v_, errors_ = field.validate(value, values, loc=("body", field.alias))

            if isinstance(errors_, ErrorWrapper):
                errors.append(errors_)
            elif isinstance(errors_, list):
                errors.extend(errors_)
            else:
                values[field.name] = v_
    return values, errors
```

With the corrections applied to the function, it should now correctly handle form data for non-typing sequences like lists, sets, and tuples and pass the failing test cases.
