### Analysis:
The buggy function `request_body_to_args` is responsible for mapping request body parameters to arguments based on required parameters and received body data. The function handles fields differently based on their type and shape, validation rules, file data handling, and default values.

The error messages indicate that the function is not correctly interpreting or assigning the values from the received body, leading to a status code error when it should return 200. The cases mentioned include scenarios where a list, set, or tuple field is expected in the request body, but the function's processing is causing issues.

### Bugs Identified:
1. The function is not correctly handling the case when the received data is a FormData but required to be a list/set/tuple in the output values.
2. The logic for extracting values from the received body is not precise when dealing with different shapes and types of fields.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bugs, we need to adjust the logic in handling different field shapes and types to match the expected output. We must ensure that the values extracted from the FormData are correctly processed and assigned to the output values based on the required parameters.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
async def request_body_to_args(
    required_params: List[ModelField],
    received_body: Optional[Union[Dict[str, Any], FormData]],
) -> Tuple[Dict[str, Any], List[ErrorWrapper]]:
    values = {}
    errors = []
    sequence_shapes = {1, 3}  # Assuming 1 for list, 3 for tuple
    for field in required_params:
        value: Any = None
        if received_body is not None:
            if field.shape in sequence_shapes and isinstance(received_body, FormData):
                unpacked_values = received_body.getlist(field.alias)
                if field.type_ == list:
                    value = unpacked_values
                elif field.type_ == set:
                    value = set(unpacked_values)
                elif field.type_ == tuple:
                    value = tuple(unpacked_values)

            else:
                value = received_body.get(field.alias)
        if value is None or (isinstance(get_field_info(field), params.Form) and value == ""):
            if field.required:
                errors.append(ErrorWrapper(MissingError(), loc=("body", field.alias))
            else:
                values[field.name] = deepcopy(field.default)
            continue
            
        if isinstance(get_field_info(field), params.File) and lenient_issubclass(field.type_, bytes) and isinstance(value, UploadFile):
            value = await value.read()
            
        v_, errors_ = field.validate(value, values, loc=("body", field.alias))
        if isinstance(errors_, ErrorWrapper):
            errors.append(errors_)
        elif isinstance(errors_, list):
            errors.extend(errors_)
        else:
            values[field.name] = v_
    
    return values, errors
```

With this corrected version, the function should now properly extract and handle data from FormData for list, set, and tuple fields, ensuring that the output values align correctly with the required parameters. This should resolve the issues causing the failing tests and lead to the expected status code of 200 in the test cases.
