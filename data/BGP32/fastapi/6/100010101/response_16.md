### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `request_body_to_args` is designed to convert received body data into a dictionary of values and a list of errors based on required parameters.
2. The error is likely due to incorrect handling of form data with non-typing sequences such as lists, sets, and tuples.
3. The error message indicates a status code of 422, meaning a validation error occurred, while the test expects a status code of 200, suggesting a failure in parameter handling.
4. The current implementation does not properly handle the conversion of form data containing non-typing sequences.
5. To fix the bug, we need to correctly extract values from form data for non-typing sequences like lists, sets, and tuples.

### Fix Strategy:
1. Ensure that list, set, and tuple input parameters are handled correctly within the function.
2. Extract values from form data for non-typing sequences and convert them appropriately.
3. Update the logic to handle form data for non-typing sequences based on the provided cases and expected values.
4. Incorporate the correct handling of form data for non-typing sequences to ensure the function returns the expected output.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
Here is the corrected version of the `request_body_to_args` function to handle form data with non-typing sequences properly:

```python
async def request_body_to_args(
    required_params: List[ModelField],
    received_body: Optional[Union[Dict[str, Any], FormData]],
) -> Tuple[Dict[str, Any], List[ErrorWrapper]]:
    values = {}
    errors = []
    
    sequence_shapes = {1}  # Define sequence shapes
    
    for field in required_params:
        if received_body is None or field.alias not in received_body:
            if field.required:
                errors.append(
                    ErrorWrapper(MissingError(), loc=("body", field.alias))
                )
            else:
                values[field.name] = deepcopy(field.default)
            continue
        
        value = received_body[field.alias]
        
        if field.shape in sequence_shapes:
            if isinstance(value, list):
                values[field.name] = value
            elif isinstance(value, (str, set, tuple)):
                values[field.name] = value if isinstance(value, tuple) else [value]
        else:
            values[field.name] = value
    
    return values, errors
```

### Explanation of Changes:
1. The corrected version adapts the logic to properly handle form data for lists, sets, and tuples as input parameters.
2. It checks if the field is present in the received body data and extracts the values accordingly.
3. It explicitly handles the case of non-typing sequences like lists, sets, and tuples to ensure correct conversion and assignment to the values dictionary.
4. Error handling is maintained for cases where required parameters are missing in the received body data.

By implementing these changes, the `request_body_to_args` function should now correctly handle form data with non-typing sequences and provide the expected values as per the defined test cases.
