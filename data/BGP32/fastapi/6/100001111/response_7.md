The bug in the `request_body_to_args` function arises from how repeated keys in form data are processed. The function fails to handle situations where multiple values are associated with the same key in the form data. It only considers the last key-value pair, leading to incorrect validation and parsing.

To fix the bug:
1. Update the function to properly handle repeated keys in the form data by collecting all values associated with the same key.
2. Ensure that the values are correctly assigned to the corresponding keys for validation.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
async def request_body_to_args(
    required_params: List[ModelField],
    received_body: Optional[Union[Dict[str, Any], FormData]],
) -> Tuple[Dict[str, Any], List[ErrorWrapper]]:
    values = {}
    errors = []
    if required_params:
        for field in required_params:
            if received_body is not None:
                if field.shape in sequence_shapes and isinstance(received_body, FormData):
                    if field.alias in received_body:
                        value = received_body.getlist(field.alias)
                    else:
                        value = field.default
                else:
                    value = received_body.get(field.alias)
            else:
                value = field.default

            v_, errors_ = field.validate(value, values, loc=("body", field.alias))

            if isinstance(errors_, ErrorWrapper):
                errors.append(errors_)
            elif isinstance(errors_, list):
                errors.extend(errors_)
            else:
                values[field.name] = v_

    return values, errors
```

This corrected version addresses the issue reported on GitHub by correctly handling repeated keys in form data. It ensures that all values associated with the same key are collected and validated as expected.
