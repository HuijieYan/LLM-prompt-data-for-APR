The issue mentioned on GitHub indicates that the current behavior of FastAPI does not support collecting repeated key=value pairs in form data and assigning them as a list to the same key before validation. This aligns with the observed behavior in the provided buggy function.

### Analysis and Bug Cause:
1. The buggy function `request_body_to_args` processes the received body data but does not handle repeated key=value pairs correctly when the shape of the field is a list, set, or tuple.
2. In the failing cases, the function only processes the last value of the repeated key, leading to validation errors and incorrect final values.
3. The function should collect all values of the repeated key and assign them as a list, set, or tuple to the same key before validation.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Modify the function to properly handle repeated key=value pairs when the field shape is a list, set, or tuple.
2. Collect all values of a repeated key and assign them as a list, set, or tuple during data processing.
3. Ensure proper validation considering the collected values for a field with a shape different than "single".

### Corrected Function:
```python
async def request_body_to_args(
    required_params: List[ModelField],
    received_body: Optional[Union[Dict[str, Any], FormData]],
) -> Tuple[Dict[str, Any], List[ErrorWrapper]]:
    values = {}
    errors = []
    if required_params:
        for field in required_params:
            value: Any = None
            if received_body is not None:
                if field.shape in sequence_shapes and isinstance(
                    received_body, FormData
                ):
                    values[field.name] = received_body.getlist(field.alias)
                else:
                    value = received_body.get(field.alias)
                    if field.shape in sequence_shapes and isinstance(value, (list, set, tuple)):
                        values[field.name] = value
            if values.get(field.name) is None or (value == "" and field.required):
                if field.required:
                    errors.append(
                        ErrorWrapper(MissingError(), loc=("body", field.alias))
                    )
                else:
                    values[field.name] = deepcopy(field.default)
            else:
                v_, errors_ = field.validate(values[field.name], values, loc=("body", field.alias))
                if isinstance(errors_, ErrorWrapper):
                    errors.append(errors_)
                elif isinstance(errors_, list):
                    errors.extend(errors_)
                else:
                    values[field.name] = v_
    return values, errors
```

### Updated explanations:
1. Collect all values of a repeated key and assign them to the same key during processing.
2. Check for the presence of collected values and handle missing or empty values according to field requirements.
3. Validate the collected values considering the correct shapes for the fields.

The corrected function should now properly handle repeated key=value pairs in form data and provide the expected output values based on the failing test cases.
