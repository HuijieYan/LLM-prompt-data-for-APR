### Error and Bug Analysis
The buggy function `request_body_to_args` is designed to convert the body of a request into arguments based on required parameters. However, the function faces issues when handling incoming data that contains repeated keys, such as `FormData` with multiple values under the same key. The function fails to correctly process and assign these values to the appropriate fields, leading to validation errors and incorrect output.

The primary issue stems from how the function handles keys with multiple values in the provided `FormData`. It doesn't account for scenarios where a single key corresponds to multiple values, causing it to incorrectly process and validate the data.

### Bug Identification
1. The function doesn't correctly handle repeated keys in the `FormData` input, which results in only the last value being extracted and processed.
2. It fails to aggregate multiple values under the same key into a list to support cases where a field should accept multiple values.
3. The `value` extracted from the `received_body` variable isn't handled as a list when it contains multiple values for the same key.

### Bug Cause
The bug occurs due to the assumption that each key in the `received_body` corresponds to a single value, leading to overwriting of previous values when multiple values are present. This behavior contradicts the expected functionality, causing issues with validation and parameter assignment.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To address the bug, the function should be modified to properly handle repeated keys in the input `FormData`. When encountering multiple values for the same key, these values should be aggregated into a list before validation. By ensuring that all values for a field are appropriately processed and considered, the bug can be resolved.

### Corrected Function
Here is the corrected version of the `request_body_to_args` function:

```python
async def request_body_to_args(
    required_params: List[ModelField],
    received_body: Optional[Union[Dict[str, Any], FormData]],
) -> Tuple[Dict[str, Any], List[ErrorWrapper]]:
    values = {}
    errors = []
    if required_params:
        for field in required_params:
            value = None
            if received_body is not None:
                if field.shape in sequence_shapes and isinstance(received_body, FormData):
                    value = received_body.getlist(field.alias)
                else:
                    value = received_body.getlist(field.alias) if field.alias in received_body else None

            if value is None and field.required:
                if PYDANTIC_1:
                    errors.append(
                        ErrorWrapper(MissingError(), loc=('body', field.alias))
                    )
                else:
                    errors.append(
                        ErrorWrapper(MissingError(), loc=('body', field.alias), config=BaseConfig)
                    )
            else:
                if isinstance(field_info, params.File) and lenient_issubclass(field.type_, bytes) and isinstance(value, sequence_types):
                    awaitables = [sub_value.read() for sub_value in value]
                    contents = await asyncio.gather(*awaitables)
                    value = sequence_shape_to_type[field.shape](contents)

                v_, errors_ = field.validate(value, values, loc=('body', field.alias))

                if isinstance(errors_, ErrorWrapper):
                    errors.append(errors_)
                elif isinstance(errors_, list):
                    errors.extend(errors_)
                else:
                    values[field.name] = v_
    return values, errors
```

In the corrected version, the function now correctly handles repeated keys and aggregates multiple values into lists when extracting data from `FormData`. This modification ensures that all values associated with a field are considered during validation, resolving the bug and aligning with the expected behavior outlined in the GitHub issue.
