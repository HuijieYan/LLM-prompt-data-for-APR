### Analysis:
The bug in the `request_body_to_args` function is related to how FastAPI handles repeated keys in form data. The function is responsible for extracting values from request body data and populating a dictionary with these values. However, the current implementation does not correctly handle repeated keys in form data, leading to only the last key=value pair being considered.

### Potential Error Locations:
1. The section where `received_body` is modified to assign only the last value when no `embed` attribute is present.
2. The section where values are extracted from `received_body` using `field.alias`.

### Cause of the Bug:
The cause of the bug is that the function doesn't account for repeated keys in form data. When multiple values are associated with the same key in form data, only the last value is considered. This behavior contradicts the expected behavior where all values associated with the same key should be collected into a list.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug and address the GitHub issue, we need to modify the function to collect all values associated with repeated keys and populate them as a list in the dictionary. This way, users can access all the values associated with a repeated key when using `Form` in FastAPI.

### Corrected Version:
```python
async def request_body_to_args(
    required_params: List[ModelField],
    received_body: Optional[Union[Dict[str, Any], FormData]],
) -> Tuple[Dict[str, Any], List[ErrorWrapper]]:
    values = {}
    errors = []
    if required_params:
        field = required_params[0]
        field_info = get_field_info(field)
        embed = getattr(field_info, "embed", None)
        if len(required_params) == 1 and not embed:
            received_body = {field.alias: received_body}
        for field in required_params:
            values[field.name] = []
            if received_body is not None:
                if field.shape in sequence_shapes and isinstance(
                    received_body, FormData
                ):
                    values[field.name].extend(received_body.getlist(field.alias))
                else:
                    values[field.name].append(received_body.get(field.alias))
            for index, value in enumerate(values[field.name]):
                if (
                    value is None
                    or (isinstance(field_info, params.Form) and value == "")
                    or (
                        isinstance(field_info, params.Form)
                        and field.shape in sequence_shapes
                        and len(value) == 0
                    )

                                ErrorWrapper(MissingError(), loc=("body", field.alias))
                            )
                        else:  # pragma: nocover
                            errors.append(
                                ErrorWrapper(  # type: ignore
                                    MissingError(),
                                    loc=("body", field.alias),
                                    config=BaseConfig,
                                )
                            )
                    else:
                        values[field.name][index] = deepcopy(field.default)
                        continue
                if (
                    isinstance(field_info, params.File)
                    and lenient_issubclass(field.type_, bytes)
                    and isinstance(value, UploadFile)
                ):
                    value = await value.read()
                elif (
                    field.shape in sequence_shapes
                    and isinstance(field_info, params.File)
                    and lenient_issubclass(field.type_, bytes)
                    and isinstance(value, sequence_types)
                ):
                    awaitables = [sub_value.read() for sub_value in value]
                    contents = await asyncio.gather(*awaitables)
                    value = sequence_shape_to_type[field.shape](contents)
                v_, errors_ = field.validate(value, values, loc=("body", field.alias))
                if isinstance(errors_, ErrorWrapper):
                    errors.append(errors_)
                elif isinstance(errors_, list):
                    errors.extend(errors_)
                else:
                    values[field.name][index] = v_
    return values, errors
```

In the corrected version of the function:
- We correctly handle repeated keys in form data by collecting all values associated with the same key into a list within the dictionary.
- Values for each field are now stored in a list to accommodate multiple values for the same key.
- The function now maintains the position of each value in the list to ensure correct validation and processing.

This should address the bug and align with the expected behavior described in the GitHub issue.
