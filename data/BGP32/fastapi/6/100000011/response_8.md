### Analysis:
The buggy function `request_body_to_args` is responsible for converting request body data into arguments based on the required parameters and their corresponding values. The function currently has a bug that causes it to only extract the last value for repeated keys in Form data, which is related to the GitHub issue titled "Support repeated key=value in form data".

### Potential Error Locations:
1. The bug may be occurring in the section where the function processes the input data to handle repeated keys.
2. There might be issues with how the function assigns values to the respective keys in the `values` dictionary.

### Cause of the Bug:
The bug in the function is caused by the logic that handles repeated keys in Form data. The function currently only extracts the last value for repeated keys, which contradicts the expected behavior as described in the GitHub issue. This results in missing or incorrect data when the same key is assigned multiple values.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug and address the GitHub issue, we need to modify the function logic to collect all values associated with repeated keys and store them as a list for the key in question. This way, the function will correctly handle repeated keys in Form data and assign them as a list to the respective key for validation.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
Here is the corrected version of the `request_body_to_args` function:

```python
async def request_body_to_args(
    required_params: List[ModelField],
    received_body: Optional[Union[Dict[str, Any], FormData]],
) -> Tuple[Dict[str, Any], List[ErrorWrapper]]:
    values = {}
    errors = []
    if required_params:
        for field in required_params:
            value: Any = None
            if received_body is not None:
                if isinstance(received_body, FormData):
                    if field.shape in sequence_shapes:
                        value = received_body.getlist(field.alias)
                    else:
                        value = received_body.get(field.alias)
            if value is None and field.required:
                if PYDANTIC_1:
                    errors.append(
                        ErrorWrapper(MissingError(), loc=("body", field.alias))
                    )
                else:  # pragma: nocover
                    errors.append(
                        ErrorWrapper(MissingError(), loc=("body", field.alias), config=BaseConfig)
                    )
            elif value is not None:
                if field.shape in sequence_shapes:
                    values[field.name] = value
                else:
                    v_, errors_ = field.validate(value, values, loc=("body", field.alias))
                    if isinstance(errors_, ErrorWrapper):
                        errors.append(errors_)
                    elif isinstance(errors_, list):
                        errors.extend(errors_)
                    else:
                        values[field.name] = v_
    return values, errors
```

In the corrected version above, we have updated the logic for handling repeated keys in Form data by correctly assigning all values associated with a key as a list to the respective key in the `values` dictionary. This fix will resolve the bug related to processing repeated keys and ensure that all key=value pairs are handled appropriately during validation.
