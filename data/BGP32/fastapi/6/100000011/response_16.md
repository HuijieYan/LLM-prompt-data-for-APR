### Analysis:
The buggy function `request_body_to_args` is responsible for converting the request body parameters to the appropriate arguments based on the required parameters list. One of the issues raised in the GitHub issue is related to handling repeated keys in form data. Currently, the function does not support this behavior.

### Potential Error Locations:
1. Handling of repeated keys in form data to create a list of values for the same key.
2. Validating against the last value only, instead of collecting all values for repeated keys.
3. Data conversion and validation logic might not be handling repeated keys correctly.

### Cause of the Bug:
The bug in the current function is due to not handling repeated keys in form data appropriately. It only considers the last key=value pair for a key with multiple occurrences. This behavior prevents proper validation of all values for repeated keys, leading to incorrect results.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix this bug, we need to modify the function to handle repeated keys in form data correctly. We should update the logic to collect and assign all values for a repeated key as a list before validation occurs. This will ensure that all values are considered during validation and no data loss occurs.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
Here is the corrected version of the `request_body_to_args` function:

```python
async def request_body_to_args(
    required_params: List[ModelField],
    received_body: Optional[Union[Dict[str, Any], FormData]],
) -> Tuple[Dict[str, Any], List[ErrorWrapper]]:
    values = {}
    errors = []
    for field in required_params:
        value = None
        if received_body is not None:
            if field.shape in sequence_shapes and isinstance(received_body, FormData):
                values[field.name] = received_body.getlist(field.alias)
            else:
                value = received_body.get(field.alias)
            if value is None or (isinstance(get_field_info(field), params.Form) and value == ""):
                if field.required:
                    errors.append(ErrorWrapper(MissingError(), loc=("body", field.alias))
                else:
                    values[field.name] = deepcopy(field.default)
            else:
                if isinstance(get_field_info(field), params.File) and lenient_issubclass(field.type_, bytes) and isinstance(value, UploadFile):
                    value = await value.read()
                v_, errors_ = field.validate(value, values, loc=("body", field.alias))
                if isinstance(errors_, ErrorWrapper):
                    errors.append(errors_)
                elif isinstance(errors_, list):
                    errors.extend(errors_)
                else:
                    values[field.name] = v_

    return values, errors
```

In this corrected version:
- We iterate over all required parameters and handle repeated keys by collecting all values as a list of values for the same key.
- Data conversion, validation, and error handling logic have been maintained with appropriate modifications to support handling repeated keys in form data.

This corrected version addresses the bug and aligns with the requirements mentioned in the GitHub issue related to supporting repeated key=value pairs in form data.
