### Analysis:
The buggy function `request_body_to_args` is responsible for converting request body parameters into arguments. The issue on GitHub indicates that there is a problem with handling repeated key-value pairs in form data. The function currently does not account for this scenario and only retrieves the last key-value pair.

### Potential Error Locations:
1. The for loop iterating over `required_params` may not handle repeated keys properly.
2. The logic for checking the shape of the field and handling sequence shapes may cause issues.
3. The validation logic for field values may not handle repeated keys correctly.

### Cause of the Bug:
The bug in the current function is that it does not handle repeated key-value pairs in form data. It only retrieves the last value for a key, which does not align with the expected behavior mentioned in the GitHub issue. This leads to the issue raised in the GitHub where FastAPI cannot validate against all values for a repeated key.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to modify the function to correctly handle repeated key-value pairs in form data. We should collect all values for the same key and store them as a list before validation occurs. This will align with the expected behavior mentioned in the GitHub issue.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
async def request_body_to_args(
    required_params: List[ModelField],
    received_body: Optional[Union[Dict[str, Any], FormData]],
) -> Tuple[Dict[str, Any], List[ErrorWrapper]]:
    values = {}
    errors = {}
    collected_values = {}
    if required_params:
        for field in required_params:
            values[field.name] = deepcopy(field.default)
            collected_values[field.name] = []
        
        if received_body is not None:
            for field in required_params:
                if field.shape in sequence_shapes and isinstance(received_body, FormData):
                    collected_values[field.name] = received_body.getlist(field.alias)
                else:
                    value = received_body.get(field.alias)
                    collected_values[field.name].append(value)
        
        for field in required_params:
            errors[field.name] = []
            if field.required and not collected_values[field.name]:
                errors[field.name].append(ErrorWrapper(MissingError(), loc=("body", field.alias)))
            else:
                for idx, value in enumerate(collected_values[field.name]):
                    if isinstance(field_info, params.File) and lenient_issubclass(field.type_, bytes) and isinstance(value, UploadFile):
                        collected_values[field.name][idx] = await value.read()
                    
                    v_, errors_ = field.validate(value, values, loc=("body", field.alias))
                    if isinstance(errors_, ErrorWrapper):
                        errors[field.name].append(errors_)
                    elif isinstance(errors_, list):
                        errors[field.name].extend(errors_)
                    else:
                        values[field.name] = v_
    
    return values, errors
``` 

In the corrected version of the function:
1. We collect all values for the same key into a list before validation.
2. We check if the value is empty for a required field and add a MissingError if necessary.
3. We iterate over collected values for each field and handle file types appropriately.
4. We validate each value against the field and store errors accordingly.

This corrected version should now handle repeated key-value pairs in form data as mentioned in the GitHub issue.
