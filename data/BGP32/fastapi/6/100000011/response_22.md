### Analysis:
The buggy function `request_body_to_args` is expected to convert the received body data into arguments based on the required parameters. However, there seems to be an issue in handling repeated key-value pairs in form data. This issue is related to the GitHub issue titled "Support repeated key=value in form data."

### Potential Error Locations:
1. The loop handling the required parameters may not correctly handle repeated key-value pairs.
2. Validation logic for handling repeated key-value pairs might not be implemented accurately.

### Cause of the Bug:
The bug is likely caused by the function assuming that only the last key=value pair is considered when handling repeated values for a single key. This results in incorrect handling of repeated values, which does not align with the expected behavior mentioned in the GitHub issue.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug and address the GitHub issue, the function should be modified to correctly handle repeated key-value pairs for the same key in form data. This involves collecting all values associated with a repeated key and assigning them as a list to the same key before validation occurs.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
Below is the corrected version of the `request_body_to_args` function:

```python
async def request_body_to_args(
    required_params: List[ModelField],
    received_body: Optional[Union[Dict[str, Any], FormData]],
) -> Tuple[Dict[str, Any], List[ErrorWrapper]]:
    values = {}
    errors = {}
    form_data = received_body if isinstance(received_body, FormData) else FormData(received_body)
    for field in required_params:
        alias = field.alias
        values[alias] = []
        for key, value in form_data.multi_items():
            if key == alias:
                values[alias].append(value)
        if field in form_data:
            value = form_data[field.alias]
            if len(value) == 1:
                value = value[0]
            v_, errors_ = field.validate(value, values, loc=("body", alias))
            if isinstance(errors_, ErrorWrapper):
                errors[alias] = errors_
            elif isinstance(errors_, list):
                errors[alias] = errors_
            else:
                values[field.name] = v_
    return values, errors
```

This corrected version ensures that all values associated with a repeated key are collected as a list before validation, addressing the bug and aligning with the expected behavior mentioned in the GitHub issue.
