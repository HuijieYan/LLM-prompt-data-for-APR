### Analysis:
The buggy function `request_body_to_args` is responsible for extracting values from request bodies and converting them to arguments based on the provided required params. The issue reported on GitHub suggests that the function should support repeated keys in form data and handle them as a list.

### Potential error locations:
1. The logic for handling sequence shapes and form data keys in the `request_body_to_args` function.
2. Validation and processing of values extracted from the request body.
3. Error handling and appending errors to the errors list.

### Cause of the bug:
The current implementation of the `request_body_to_args` function does not handle repeated keys in form data properly. It assigns the last key=value pair instead of aggregating them into a list. This behavior does not align with the expectations of the users requesting support for repeated key=value in form data.

### Strategy for fixing the bug:
To fix the bug and address the GitHub issue, we need to modify the logic within the `request_body_to_args` function to collect repeated keys in form data as a list and assign them to the same key before validation occurs. This will ensure that all values for repeated keys are considered during the processing.

### Corrected Version:
```python
async def request_body_to_args(
    required_params: List[ModelField],
    received_body: Optional[Union[Dict[str, Any], FormData]],
) -> Tuple[Dict[str, Any], List[ErrorWrapper]]:
    values = {}
    errors = []
    
    if required_params:
        processed_values = {}
        field_info = get_field_info(required_params[0])
        
        for field in required_params:
            key = field.alias
            raw_value = received_body.getlist(key) if isinstance(received_body, FormData) else [received_body.get(key)]
            values[key] = raw_value

            value: Any = None
            if not raw_value:
                if field.required:
                    errors.append(ErrorWrapper(MissingError(), loc=("body", field.alias))
                else:
                    values[field.name] = deepcopy(field.default)
            else:
                value = raw_value if field.shape in sequence_shapes else raw_value[0]
                if (isinstance(field_info, params.File) and lenient_issubclass(field.type_, bytes) and isinstance(value, UploadFile)):
                    value = await value.read()
                    
            v_, errors_ = field.validate(value, values, loc=("body", field.alias))
            if isinstance(errors_, ErrorWrapper):
                errors.append(errors_)
            elif isinstance(errors_, list):
                errors.extend(errors_)
            else:
                values[field.name] = v_

    return values, errors
```

In the corrected version:
- Repeated keys in form data are considered by aggregating their values into a list.
- Each key gets its list of values in the `values` dictionary.
- The validation logic is updated to handle these list values appropriately.
- Errors are added to the `errors` list for proper error handling.

This corrected version aligns with the GitHub issue's request for supporting repeated key=value in form data.
