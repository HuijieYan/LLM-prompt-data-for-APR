### Analysis:
The buggy function `request_body_to_args` is responsible for extracting values from the request body based on the required parameters specified. The function is supposed to handle various cases such as handling form data, validating file uploads, and handling sequences.

### Identified Potential Error Locations:
1. The logic that deals with handling multiple values for the same key in form data might be causing the bug as reported in the GitHub issue.
2. The validation and extraction of values from the request body may have issues, especially when dealing with sequences.

### Cause of the Bug:
The bug reported in the GitHub issue could be caused by the current implementation of the function `request_body_to_args` which does not correctly handle repeated keys in the form data. As a result, only the last key=value pair is considered, leading to incorrect validation against the last value.

### Suggested Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug and address the GitHub issue, the function should be modified to handle repeated keys in the form data properly. The function should collect all values for a repeated key and assign those values as a list to the corresponding key before validation is performed.

### Corrected Function:
```python
async def request_body_to_args(
    required_params: List[ModelField],
    received_body: Optional[Union[Dict[str, Any], FormData]],
) -> Tuple[Dict[str, Any], List[ErrorWrapper]]:
    values = {}
    errors = []
    if required_params:
        for field in required_params:
            values[field.name] = []
            if received_body is not None:
                if field.shape in sequence_shapes and isinstance(
                    received_body, FormData
                ):
                    values[field.name] = received_body.getlist(field.alias)
                else:
                    value = received_body.get(field.alias)
                    if value is not None:
                        values[field.name].append(value)
            if not values[field.name] and field.required:
                if PYDANTIC_1:
                    errors.append(
                        ErrorWrapper(MissingError(), loc=("body", field.alias))
                    )
                else:
                    errors.append(
                        ErrorWrapper(
                            MissingError(),
                            loc=("body", field.alias),
                            config=BaseConfig,
                        )
                    )
        for field in required_params:
            if values[field.name]:
                value = values[field.name]
                field_info = get_field_info(field)
                if (
                    isinstance(field_info, params.File)
                    and lenient_issubclass(field.type_, bytes)
                    and isinstance(value, list)
                ):
                    value = [await val.read() for val in value]
                v_, errors_ = field.validate(value, values, loc=("body", field.alias))
                if isinstance(errors_, ErrorWrapper):
                    errors.append(errors_)
                elif isinstance(errors_, list):
                    errors.extend(errors_)
                else:
                    values[field.name] = v_

    return values, errors
```

### Additional Notes:
- The corrected version of the function now correctly handles repeated keys in form data.
- It collects all values for a repeated key and assigns those values as a list to the corresponding key before validation is performed.
- The corrected function should address the bug reported in the GitHub issue by supporting repeated key=value pairs in form data.
