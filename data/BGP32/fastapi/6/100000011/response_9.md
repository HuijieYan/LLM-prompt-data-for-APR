### Analysis:
The buggy function `request_body_to_args` is responsible for converting the received body data into arguments for a FastAPI endpoint. The function specifically deals with handling form data. The issue reported on GitHub suggests that the function doesn't support handling repeated keys in form data properly, resulting in only the last key=value pair being considered.

### Potential Error Locations:
1. The logic for processing repeated keys in form data is missing.
2. The loop that iterates through the required parameters might not be handling the repeated keys correctly.
3. Incorrect handling of field validation and errors generation.

### Cause of the Bug:
The cause of the bug is related to the incorrect handling of repeated keys in form data. The function is not designed to handle multiple values for the same key and ends up considering only the last value. This behavior contradicts the expected behavior of collecting repeated keys and assigning those values as a list before validation.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to modify the function to properly handle repeated keys in form data. We should modify the logic so that all values for a repeated key are collected into a list before validation. This way, the function can effectively process form data with repeated keys.

### Corrected Version:
```python
async def request_body_to_args(
    required_params: List[ModelField],
    received_body: Optional[Union[Dict[str, Any], FormData]],
) -> Tuple[Dict[str, Any], List[ErrorWrapper]]:
    values = {}
    errors = []
    if required_params:
        field = required_params[0]
        field_info = get_field_info(field)
        embed = getattr(field_info, "embed", None)
        if len(required_params) == 1 and not embed:
            received_body = {field.alias: received_body}
        for field in required_params:
            value: Any = None
            if received_body is not None:
                if field.shape in sequence_shapes and isinstance(
                        received_body, FormData
                ):
                    if field.shape == "list":
                        value = received_body.getlist(field.alias)
                    else:
                        value = received_body.get(field.alias)
                else:
                    value = received_body.get(field.alias)
            if (
                value is None
                or (isinstance(field_info, params.Form) and value == "")
                or (
                    isinstance(field_info, params.Form)
                    and field.shape in sequence_shapes
                    and len(value) == 0
                )
            ):
                if field.required:
                    if PYDANTIC_1:
                        errors.append(
                            ErrorWrapper(MissingError(), loc=("body", field.alias))
                        )
                    else:  # pragma: nocover
                        errors.append(
                            ErrorWrapper(  # type: ignore
                                MissingError(),
                                loc=("body", field.alias),
                                config=BaseConfig,
                            )
                        )
                else:
                    values[field.name] = deepcopy(field.default)
                continue
            if (
                isinstance(field_info, params.File)
                and lenient_issubclass(field.type_, bytes)
                and isinstance(value, UploadFile)
            ):
                value = await value.read()
            elif (
                field.shape in sequence_shapes
                and isinstance(field_info, params.File)
                and lenient_issubclass(field.type_, bytes)
                and isinstance(value, sequence_types)
            ):
                awaitables = [sub_value.read() for sub_value in value]
                contents = await asyncio.gather(*awaitables)
                value = sequence_shape_to_type[field.shape](contents)
            v_, errors_ = field.validate(value, values, loc=("body", field.alias))
            if isinstance(errors_, ErrorWrapper):
                errors.append(errors_)
            elif isinstance(errors_, list):
                errors.extend(errors_)
            else:
                values[field.name] = v_
    return values, errors
```

In the corrected version:
- Repeated keys in form data are now correctly handled by checking if the field shape is "list" and then using `getlist` to retrieve all values.
- Other validation and error generation logic remains intact.

By updating the function to handle repeated keys in form data, the issue reported on GitHub should be resolved, and the function should behave as expected.
