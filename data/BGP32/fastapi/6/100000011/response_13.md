### Analysis:
The buggy function `request_body_to_args` is responsible for converting received request body data into arguments based on the required parameters. The issue reported on GitHub is related to supporting repeated key-value pairs in form data, where currently only the last key-value pair is considered.

### Potential error locations:
1. Incorrect handling of repeated key-value pairs in form data.
2. Incorrect validation and assignment of values for required parameters.
3. Incorrect handling of different field types, especially when dealing with sequences.

### Cause of the bug:
The bug is caused by the function not correctly handling repeated key-value pairs in form data. It only considers the last key-value pair instead of collecting all values for a repeated key into a list before validation. This leads to missing data and incorrect validation results for parameters that are supposed to be lists of values.

### Strategy for fixing the bug:
To fix the bug, we need to modify the function to correctly handle repeated key-value pairs in form data and assign the values as a list for the same key before validation. This will ensure that all values for a repeated key are considered during validation and assigned appropriately to the required parameters.

### Corrected Version:
```python
async def request_body_to_args(
    required_params: List[ModelField],
    received_body: Optional[Union[Dict[str, Any], FormData]],
) -> Tuple[Dict[str, Any], List[ErrorWrapper]]:
    values = {}
    errors = []

    if required_params:
        for field in required_params:
            value: Any = None
            if received_body is not None:
                if field.shape in sequence_shapes and isinstance(received_body, FormData):
                    values[field.alias] = received_body.getlist(field.alias)
                else:
                    value = received_body.get(field.alias)

            if value is None or (isinstance(field_info, params.Form) and value == "") or (
                isinstance(field_info, params.Form)
                and field.shape in sequence_shapes
                and len(value) == 0
            ):
                if field.required:
                    if PYDANTIC_1:
                        errors.append(ErrorWrapper(MissingError(), loc=("body", field.alias))
                    else:
                        errors.append(ErrorWrapper(MissingError(), loc=("body", field.alias), config=BaseConfig)
                else:
                    values[field.name] = deepcopy(field.default)
            else:
                if isinstance(value, list) and field.shape not in sequence_shapes:
                    values[field.name] = value[0]
                else:
                    if isinstance(field_info, params.File) and lenient_issubclass(field.type_, bytes) and isinstance(value, UploadFile):
                        value = await value.read()
                    elif field.shape in sequence_shapes and isinstance(field_info, params.File) and lenient_issubclass(field.type_, bytes) and isinstance(value, sequence_types):
                        awaitables = [sub_value.read() for sub_value in value]
                        contents = await asyncio.gather(*awaitables)
                        value = sequence_shape_to_type[field.shape](contents)
                    
                    v_, errors_ = field.validate(value, values, loc=("body", field.alias))
                    
                    if isinstance(errors_, ErrorWrapper):
                        errors.append(errors_)
                    elif isinstance(errors_, list):
                        errors.extend(errors_)
                    else:
                        values[field.name] = v_
    return values, errors
```

In the corrected version, we have modified the function to handle repeated key-value pairs in form data correctly. The values for a repeated key are now collected into a list before validation. This ensures that all values for a repeated key are considered during validation and assigned appropriately to the required parameters.
