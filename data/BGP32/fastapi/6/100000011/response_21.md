### Analysis:
The buggy function `request_body_to_args` is responsible for extracting values from the request body and validating them based on the provided `required_params`. The function is unable to handle repeated keys in form data, as mentioned in the GitHub issue. This limitation prevents proper validation against all values when multiple values are associated with the same key in the form data.

### Error Location:
The main issue lies in the handling of repeated keys in form data and the subsequent validation process. The current implementation only considers the last value associated with a key, thus limiting the validation against all values.

### Cause of the Bug:
The bug arises from the fact that when iterating over the received body data, the function only retrieves the last value associated with a key, leading to incomplete validation. This behavior does not align with the expectations of users who want to validate all values associated with repeated keys in form data.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug and address the GitHub issue, we need to modify the function to handle repeated keys in form data correctly. The function should collect all values associated with a key and ensure that they are validated as a list when a parameter expects multiple values. This will enable proper validation against all values provided for a key.

### Corrected Version:
Here is the corrected version of the `request_body_to_args` function:

```python
async def request_body_to_args(
    required_params: List[ModelField],
    received_body: Optional[Union[Dict[str, Any], FormData]],
) -> Tuple[Dict[str, Any], List[ErrorWrapper]]:
    values = {}
    errors = []
    if required_params:
        for field in required_params:
            if received_body is not None:
                if field.shape in sequence_shapes and isinstance(received_body, FormData):
                    value = received_body.getlist(field.alias)
                else:
                    value = received_body.getall(field.alias)  # Change to getall to retrieve all values for a key
            if value is None or (isinstance(field_info, params.Form) and value == "") or (
                isinstance(field_info, params.Form)
                and field.shape in sequence_shapes
                and len(value) == 0
            ):
                if field.required:
                    if PYDANTIC_1:
                        errors.append(ErrorWrapper(MissingError(), loc=("body", field.alias)))
                    else:
                        errors.append(
                            ErrorWrapper(MissingError(), loc=("body", field.alias), config=BaseConfig)
                        )
                else:
                    values[field.name] = deepcopy(field.default)
                continue
            if (
                isinstance(field_info, params.File)
                and lenient_issubclass(field.type_, bytes)
                and isinstance(value, UploadFile)
            ):
                value = await value.read()
            elif (
                field.shape in sequence_shapes
                and isinstance(field_info, params.File)
                and lenient_issubclass(field.type_, bytes)
                and isinstance(value, sequence_types)
            ):
                awaitables = [sub_value.read() for sub_value in value]
                contents = await asyncio.gather(*awaitables)
                value = sequence_shape_to_type[field.shape](contents)
            v_, errors_ = field.validate(value, values, loc=("body", field.alias))
            if isinstance(errors_, ErrorWrapper):
                errors.append(errors_)
            elif isinstance(errors_, list):
                errors.extend(errors_)
            else:
                values[field.name] = v_
    return values, errors
```

In the corrected version, the function uses the `getall` method to retrieve all values associated with a key in form data, ensuring that all values are passed for validation against the required parameter. This modification enables the function to support repeated keys in form data while validating all values properly, addressing the issue raised in the GitHub report.
