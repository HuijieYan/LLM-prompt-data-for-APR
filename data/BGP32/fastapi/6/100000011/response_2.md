### Analysis:
The GitHub issue suggests that there is a problem with handling repeated key-value pairs in Form data. The `request_body_to_args` function is responsible for extracting values and errors from the received body based on the required parameters. However, the issue mentions that only the last key-value wins in the current implementation.

### Potential Error Locations:
1. Handling repeated key-value pairs in Form data.
2. Validation logic for extracting values.

### Cause of the Bug:
The bug occurs because the function only captures the last key-value pair from the Form data, leading to validation against only that value. This behavior contradicts the expected functionality mentioned in the GitHub issue.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug and support repeated key-value pairs in Form data, the function needs to be modified to collect all key-value pairs for a specific key and assign them as a list before validation. This adjustment will ensure that all values for a certain key are considered during validation.

### Corrected Version:
```python
async def request_body_to_args(
    required_params: List[ModelField],
    received_body: Optional[Union[Dict[str, Any], FormData]],
) -> Tuple[Dict[str, Any], List[ErrorWrapper]]:
    values = {}
    errors = {}

    if received_body is not None:
        received_data = received_body.dict() if isinstance(received_body, FormData) else received_body
        for field in required_params:
            if field.alias in received_data:
                value = received_data.get(field.alias)

                if field.shape in sequence_shapes and isinstance(value, list):
                    values[field.name] = value
                else:
                    v_, error = field.validate(value, values, loc=("body", field.alias))
                    if error:
                        errors[field.alias] = error
                    else:
                        values[field.name] = v_
            elif field.required:
                errors[field.alias] = ErrorWrapper(MissingError(), loc=("body", field.alias))

    return values, list(errors.values())
```

In the corrected version, the function now checks if a given key exists in the received data and collects all values associated with that key as a list if necessary. It then validates each value against the required parameters and collects any errors before returning the values and errors as expected. This modification ensures correct handling of repeated key-value pairs in Form data.
