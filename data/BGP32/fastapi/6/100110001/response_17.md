### Analysis:
1. The `request_body_to_args` function is responsible for converting the received body data into arguments based on the required list of parameters.
2. The function checks for the value corresponding to each field in the required params list and generates errors if the value is not present or does not meet certain conditions.
3. The failing tests are related to posting form data with non-typing sequence values (lists, sets, tuples) and expecting a specific JSON response.
4. The error messages show that the response status code is 422 instead of 200.
5. The bug seems to be related to how the function handles the values inside the form data for non-typing sequences.

### Bug:
The bug appears to be caused by the function not handling non-typing sequence values correctly when generating the arguments from form data. This leads to incorrect validation and results in a 422 status code instead of 200.

### Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to modify how the function processes non-typing sequences such as lists, sets, and tuples in the form data. Specifically, we need to ensure that these values are extracted and processed correctly to pass the failing tests.

### Corrected Version:
```python
async def request_body_to_args(
    required_params: List[ModelField],
    received_body: Optional[Union[Dict[str, Any], FormData]],
) -> Tuple[Dict[str, Any], List[ErrorWrapper]]:
    values = {}
    errors = []
    if required_params:
        for field in required_params:
            value: Any = None
            if received_body is not None:
                # Check the field alias in the received body and extract the value accordingly
                if isinstance(received_body, FormData):
                    value = received_body.get(field.alias)

            if value is None:
                if field.required:
                    if PYDANTIC_1:
                        errors.append(ErrorWrapper(MissingError(), loc=("body", field.alias)))
                    else:
                        errors.append(ErrorWrapper(MissingError(), loc=("body", field.alias), config=BaseConfig))
                else:
                    values[field.name] = deepcopy(field.default)
            else:
                v_, errors_ = field.validate(value, values, loc=("body", field.alias))
                if isinstance(errors_, ErrorWrapper):
                    errors.append(errors_)
                elif isinstance(errors_, list):
                    errors.extend(errors_)
                else:
                    values[field.name] = v_

    return values, errors
```

By modifying the function to correctly extract and handle values from form data for non-typing sequences, the corrected version should now pass the failing tests and return the expected 200 status code along with the correct JSON response.
