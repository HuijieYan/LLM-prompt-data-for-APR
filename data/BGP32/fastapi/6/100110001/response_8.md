## Analysis:
1. The buggy function `request_body_to_args` is responsible for extracting values from the received body based on the required parameters.
2. It iterates over the required parameters and attempts to extract corresponding values from the received body.
3. The bug likely arises from how the function handles sequence-shaped fields like lists, sets, and tuples when extracting values from the received body.
4. The failing tests are testing the functionality of passing Python List, Python Set, and Python Tuple as form data to the FastAPI endpoint and expecting a 200 status code.
5. The error message indicates that the assertion for the response status code is failing due to a 422 status code being returned instead of the expected 200 status code.

## Bug Cause:
The bug in the `request_body_to_args` function arises from how it handles sequence-shaped fields and their values in the received body. The function incorrectly processes sequence-shaped fields like lists, sets, and tuples, leading to errors and incorrect values being extracted or validated.

## Bug Fix:
To fix the bug, the function needs to correctly handle sequence-shaped fields and ensure that the values are appropriately extracted and processed.

```python
async def request_body_to_args(
    required_params: List[ModelField],
    received_body: Optional[Union[Dict[str, Any], FormData]],
) -> Tuple[Dict[str, Any], List[ErrorWrapper]]:
    values = {}
    errors = []
    for field in required_params:
        value = received_body.get(field.alias) if received_body else None
        if value is None or value == "":  # Check if value is missing or empty string
            if field.required:
                errors.append(ErrorWrapper(MissingError(), loc=("body", field.alias)))
            else:
                values[field.name] = deepcopy(field.default)
        else:
            v, e = field.validate(value, values, loc=("body", field.alias))
            if isinstance(e, ErrorWrapper):
                errors.append(e)
            elif isinstance(e, list):
                errors.extend(e)
            else:
                values[field.name] = v
    return values, errors
```

By simplifying the extraction of values and improving the validation logic for each field, the corrected version of the `request_body_to_args` function should be able to handle sequence-shaped fields correctly.

After applying this fix, the function should correctly process Python List, Python Set, and Python Tuple passed as form data to the FastAPI endpoint, resolving the failing tests and returning the expected 200 status code.
