### Analysis:
1. The `request_body_to_args` function is responsible for converting received body data into arguments based on required fields.
2. The failing tests are related to sending data through the client post request and expecting a status code of 200 but receiving a 422 status code instead.
3. The error message indicates that the status code mismatch is causing the assertion error.
4. The bug in the function seems to be related to handling form data for sequence shapes (like list, set, tuple) where the value is not processed correctly leading to validation errors.

### Bug Cause:
The bug arises from the incorrect handling of sequence shapes (`list`, `set`, `tuple`) in the `request_body_to_args` function. The function doesn't properly extract the values for fields of sequence shapes from the form data, leading to missing or incorrect values being used during validation.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to modify the section of the code that deals with the extraction of values for fields of sequence shapes. This involves checking if the received data is of type `FormData` and extracting the sequence values accordingly.

### Corrected Function:
```python
async def request_body_to_args(
    required_params: List[ModelField],
    received_body: Optional[Union[Dict[str, Any], FormData]],
) -> Tuple[Dict[str, Any], List[ErrorWrapper]]:
    values = {}
    errors = []
    
    if required_params:
        for field in required_params:
            value: Any = None
            if received_body is not None:
                if field.shape in sequence_shapes and isinstance(received_body, FormData):
                    if field.alias in received_body.keys():
                        value = received_body.getlist(field.alias)
                    else:
                        value = None
                else:
                    value = received_body.get(field.alias)
            
            if value is None:
                if field.required:
                    errors.append(ErrorWrapper(MissingError(), loc=("body", field.alias)))
                else:
                    values[field.name] = deepcopy(field.default)
                continue
            
            # processing for File type fields
            if isinstance(field_info, params.File) and lenient_issubclass(field.type_, bytes):
                if isinstance(value, UploadFile):
                    value = await value.read()
                elif field.shape in sequence_shapes and isinstance(value, sequence_types):
                    awaitables = [sub_value.read() for sub_value in value]
                    contents = await asyncio.gather(*awaitables)
                    if field.shape == "list":
                        value = list(contents)
                    elif field.shape == "set":
                        value = set(contents)
                    elif field.shape == "tuple":
                        value = tuple(contents)
                    
            v_, errors_ = field.validate(value, values, loc=("body", field.alias))
            if isinstance(errors_, ErrorWrapper):
                errors.append(errors_)
            elif isinstance(errors_, list):
                errors.extend(errors_)
            else:
                values[field.name] = v_
                
    return values, errors
```

By modifying the extraction logic for sequence data types and ensuring the correct values are obtained for validation, the corrected function should now handle form data for sequence shapes correctly and pass the failing tests.
