The buggy function `request_body_to_args` is responsible for parsing request body parameters based on the required fields defined by the user. The function processes each required field, extracts the corresponding value from the received body, checks for errors and validations, and finally returns the parsed values along with any errors encountered in the process.

Here are the potential issues causing the failing tests:
1. The function doesn't handle specific data structures like lists, sets, and tuples properly, leading to status code 422 (Unprocessable Entity) instead of the expected 200 status code.
2. The function doesn't correctly parse sequence-shaped fields like lists, sets, and tuples from the received body.

To fix the issue, we need to update how sequence-shaped fields (lists, sets, tuples) are processed in the `request_body_to_args` function to ensure they are properly parsed from the received body.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
async def request_body_to_args(
    required_params: List[ModelField],
    received_body: Optional[Union[Dict[str, Any], FormData]],
) -> Tuple[Dict[str, Any], List[ErrorWrapper]]:
    values = {}
    errors = []
    for field in required_params:
        value: Any = None
        if received_body is not None:
            if field.shape in sequence_shapes:
                value = received_body.getlist(field.alias)
            else:
                value = received_body.get(field.alias)
        if (
            value is None
            or (isinstance(get_field_info(field), params.Form) and value == "")
            or (
                isinstance(get_field_info(field), params.Form)
                and field.shape in sequence_shapes
                and len(value) == 0
            )
        ):
            if field.required:
                if PYDANTIC_1:
                    errors.append(
                        ErrorWrapper(MissingError(), loc=("body", field.alias))
                    )
                else:  # pragma: nocover
                    errors.append(
                        ErrorWrapper(MissingError(), loc=("body", field.alias), config=BaseConfig)
                    )
            else:
                values[field.name] = deepcopy(field.default)
            continue
        if isinstance(get_field_info(field), params.File) and lenient_issubclass(field.type_, bytes):
            # Handle file uploads
            if field.shape in sequence_shapes:
                awaitables = [item.read() for item in value]
                contents = await asyncio.gather(*awaitables)
                value = sequence_shape_to_type[field.shape](contents)
            else:
                value = await value.read()
        v_, errors_ = field.validate(value, values, loc=("body", field.alias))
        if isinstance(errors_, ErrorWrapper):
            errors.append(errors_)
        elif isinstance(errors_, list):
            errors.extend(errors_)
        else:
            values[field.name] = v_
    return values, errors
```

This corrected version of the function now properly handles sequence-shaped fields and ensures that lists, sets, and tuples are parsed correctly from the received body data.

After applying this fix, the failing tests for Python list, set, and tuple parameters should pass as expected with a 200 status code for the responses.
