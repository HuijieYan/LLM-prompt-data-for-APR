### Analysis:
1. The `request_body_to_args` function takes a list of required parameters (`required_params`) and a dictionary or `FormData` object (`received_body`) as input.
2. The function checks for the presence of required parameters in the received body and processes them accordingly.
3. The error suggests that the function fails to handle certain types of data structures being passed as form data, leading to a `422` status code instead of the expected `200`.
4. The bug might be related to how sequences like lists, sets, and tuples are handled within the function, resulting in validation errors or missing values.
   
### Bug Cause:
The bug arises from the incorrect handling of sequences within the function. When dealing with sequences like lists, sets, or tuples in the form data, the function fails to process them correctly, causing validation errors or missing values.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to enhance the logic that handles sequences within the `request_body_to_args` function. Specifically, we should update the logic to handle sequences properly when the form data contains them.

### Corrected Function:
```python
async def request_body_to_args(
    required_params: List[ModelField],
    received_body: Optional[Union[Dict[str, Any], FormData]],
) -> Tuple[Dict[str, Any], List[ErrorWrapper]]:
    values = {}
    errors = []
    if required_params:
        for field in required_params:
            value: Any = None
            if received_body is not None:
                value = received_body.get(field.alias)
                if value is None:
                    if field.required:
                        errors.append(ErrorWrapper(MissingError(), loc=("body", field.alias)))
                        continue
            if isinstance(field, params.Form):
                if isinstance(field_info, ModelField):
                    if field_info.shape in sequence_shapes:
                        if isinstance(value, FormData):
                            value = value.getlist(field.alias)
                value = await field.validate(value)
            if value is not None:
                values[field.name] = value
    return values, errors
```

By updating the handling of sequence types within the function and ensuring proper validation and processing of values, the corrected version should be able to pass the failing test cases.
