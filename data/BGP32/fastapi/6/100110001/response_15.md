## Analysis:
1. The `request_body_to_args` function is responsible for processing request body parameters and mapping them to the corresponding model fields.
2. The function seems to have issues with handling sequence-shaped fields correctly, which is causing the failing tests.
3. The failing tests are due to the incorrect processing of Python sequences (list, set, and tuple) in the request body. The function is not able to handle these correctly, leading to validation errors and status code 422 responses.
4. The bug seems to be in the logic that tries to extract values from the request body for sequence-shaped fields. We need to handle list, set, and tuple correctly to pass the failing tests.

## Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Modify the logic for handling sequence-shaped fields in the request body. For Python sequences like lists, sets, and tuples, we need to extract the values correctly and validate them against the model fields.
2. Update the logic to read the values from the request body based on the field's configuration (shape).
3. Ensure correct validation and error handling for sequence-shaped fields.

## Corrected Function:
```python
async def request_body_to_args(
    required_params: List[ModelField],
    received_body: Optional[Union[Dict[str, Any], FormData]],
) -> Tuple[Dict[str, Any], List[ErrorWrapper]]:
    values = {}
    errors = []
    
    for field in required_params:
        value: Any = None
        
        if received_body is not None:
            if field.shape in sequence_shapes:
                value = received_body.getlist(field.alias) if isinstance(received_body, FormData) else received_body.get(field.alias)
            else:
                value = received_body.get(field.alias)
                
        if value is None or (isinstance(field_info, params.Form) and value == ""):
            if field.required:
                if PYDANTIC_1:
                    errors.append(ErrorWrapper(MissingError(), loc=("body", field.alias)))
                else:
                    errors.append(ErrorWrapper(MissingError(), loc=("body", field.alias), config=BaseConfig))
            else:
                values[field.name] = deepcopy(field.default)
        else:
            if isinstance(field_info, params.File) and lenient_issubclass(field.type_, bytes) and isinstance(value, UploadFile):
                value = await value.read()
            v_, errors_ = field.validate(value, values, loc=("body", field.alias))
            if isinstance(errors_, ErrorWrapper):
                errors.append(errors_)
            elif isinstance(errors_, list):
                errors.extend(errors_)
            else:
                values[field.name] = v_
                
    return values, errors
```

With the corrected function, the logic for handling sequence-shaped fields has been updated to correctly parse values from the request body, validate them against the model fields, and produce the expected output. This should address the bug and make the function pass the failing tests.
