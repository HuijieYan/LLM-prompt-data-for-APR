### Analysis:
1. The `request_body_to_args` function receives a list of required parameters and potentially a FormData or Dict containing received values.
2. The function iterates over the required params and attempts to fetch the values from the received body.
3. The function handles different cases such as files, sequences, and missing values.
4. The error occurred when the tests tried to send Python lists, sets, and tuples in the form data, but the function failed to process them correctly.

### Bug:
The buggy function `request_body_to_args` fails to properly handle sequences like lists, sets, and tuples when they are received in the form data. It doesn't extract values from the received body for these sequences, leading to errors and misinterpretation of input data.

### Fix:
Modify the function `request_body_to_args` to correctly handle sequences sent in form data, especially when it comes to lists, sets, and tuples.

### Corrected Version:
```python
async def request_body_to_args(
    required_params: List[ModelField],
    received_body: Optional[Union[Dict[str, Any], FormData]],
) -> Tuple[Dict[str, Any], List[ErrorWrapper]]:
    values = {}
    errors = []
    for field in required_params:
        value: Any = None
        if received_body is not None:
            value = received_body.get(field.alias)
            if value is not None:
                if isinstance(field_info, params.Form):
                    if field.shape in sequence_shapes and isinstance(
                        received_body, FormData
                    ):
                        # Extract values for sequences like lists, sets, and tuples
                        if isinstance(value, list) or isinstance(value, set) or isinstance(value, tuple):
                            value = list(value)
                    elif value == "":
                        value = None
                    
        if value is None:
            if field.required:
                if PYDANTIC_1:
                    errors.append(ErrorWrapper(MissingError(), loc=("body", field.alias)))
                else:  # pragma: nocover
                    errors.append(
                        ErrorWrapper(  # type: ignore
                            MissingError(),
                            loc=("body", field.alias),
                            config=BaseConfig,
                        )
                    )
            else:
                values[field.name] = deepcopy(field.default)
        else:
            v_, errors_ = field.validate(value, values, loc=("body", field.alias))
            if isinstance(errors_, ErrorWrapper):
                errors.append(errors_)
            elif isinstance(errors_, list):
                errors.extend(errors_)
            else:
                values[field.name] = v_

    return values, errors
```

### Summary:
The corrected version now properly handles sequences like lists, sets, and tuples that are sent as form data. It extracts values from the received body for these sequences and ensures that the input data is processed correctly to avoid errors. The function should now pass the failing tests provided.
