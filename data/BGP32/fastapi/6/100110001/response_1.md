## Analysis:
The buggy function `request_body_to_args` is responsible for extracting values from a request body based on the required parameters defined as ModelFields. It then validates the extracted values and accumulates any errors encountered during the process.

The relationship between the buggy function and the failing tests is that the failing tests are attempting to send data in a specific shape (list, set, tuple) as part of the request body, expecting the function to extract and process them correctly. The error message indicates that the response status code is 422 (unprocessable entity) instead of the expected 200 (OK).

## Bug:
The bug in the `request_body_to_args` function likely stems from how it handles sequence-like structures (such as lists) in the request body. The function is not set up to handle extracting these correctly, leading to validation errors and the resulting 422 status code in the responses.

The problematic part of the function is when it attempts to process the values from the request body. It does not handle sequence shapes properly, resulting in errors during value extraction and validation.

## Solution:
To fix the bug, the function needs to correctly handle various sequence shapes in the request body and validation process. Specifically, when dealing with sequence shapes like lists, sets, or tuples, the function should extract them appropriately and ensure that they are validated correctly.

One possible strategy for fixing the bug is to update the logic within the function to handle sequence shapes differently. Specifically, when encountering a sequence shape in the field information, the function should handle it by extracting and processing the values accordingly.

## Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
async def request_body_to_args(
    required_params: List[ModelField],
    received_body: Optional[Union[Dict[str, Any], FormData]],
) -> Tuple[Dict[str, Any], List[ErrorWrapper]]:
    values = {}
    errors = []
    for field in required_params:
        value = None
        if received_body is not None:
            if field.shape in sequence_shapes and isinstance(received_body, FormData):
                value = received_body.getlist(field.alias)
            else:
                value = received_body.get(field.alias)
                
        if value is None:
            if field.required:
                errors.append(ErrorWrapper(MissingError(), loc=("body", field.alias)))
        else:
            v_, errors_ = field.validate(value, values, loc=("body", field.alias))
            if isinstance(errors_, ErrorWrapper):
                errors.append(errors_)
            elif isinstance(errors_, list):
                errors.extend(errors_)
            else:
                values[field.name] = v_
                    
    return values, errors
```

In the corrected version, the function iterates over each required parameter, extracts the corresponding value from the request body based on the field alias, and then validates the extracted value. If the value is missing and the field is required, a missing error is appended to the errors list. Otherwise, the extracted value is validated and stored in the values dictionary.

This corrected version should now handle sequence shapes properly and pass the failing tests provided.
