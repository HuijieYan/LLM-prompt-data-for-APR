## Analysis
The buggy function `request_body_to_args` is responsible for converting received request data into arguments. The issue seems to be related to handling non-keyword arguments in the form data. The failing tests indicate that there is an issue with how sequences (list, set, tuple) are being processed when received as form data.

## Potential Error Locations
- The check for `sequence_shapes` in the if condition seems to be causing the issue.
- The part of the code that handles values for sequence shapes might not be correctly implemented.

## Bug Explanation
The failing tests are due to the fact that the function is not correctly handling form data when it contains sequences (list, set, tuple) as values. This leads to the function returning incorrect status codes (422 instead of 200) because the values are not being processed and validated properly.

## Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the function correctly handles form data with sequence values. This involves properly parsing sequence-shaped values, reading them if they are files, and ensuring correct validation for each element in the sequence.

## Corrected Version of the Function
```python
async def request_body_to_args(
    required_params: List[ModelField],
    received_body: Optional[Union[Dict[str, Any], FormData]],
) -> Tuple[Dict[str, Any], List[ErrorWrapper]]:
    values = {}
    errors = []
    if required_params:
        for field in required_params:
            value: Any = None
            if received_body is not None:
                value = received_body.get(field.alias)
                if value is not None:
                    if (
                        isinstance(value, list)
                        and field.shape not in sequence_shapes
                        and not isinstance(field_info, params.File)
                    ):
                        value = value[0]
            if (
                value is None
                or (isinstance(field_info, params.Form) and value == "")
                or (
                    isinstance(field_info, params.Form)
                    and field.shape in sequence_shapes
                    and len(value) == 0
                )
            ):
                if field.required:
                    errors.append(
                        ErrorWrapper(MissingError(), loc=("body", field.alias))
                    )
                else:
                    values[field.name] = deepcopy(field.default)
                continue
            if (
                isinstance(field_info, params.File)
                and lenient_issubclass(field.type_, bytes)
                and isinstance(value, UploadFile)
            ):
                value = await value.read()
            elif (
                field.shape in sequence_shapes
                and isinstance(field_info, params.File)
                and lenient_issubclass(field.type_, bytes)
                and isinstance(value, sequence_types)
            ):
                awaitables = [sub_value.read() for sub_value in value]
                contents = await asyncio.gather(*awaitables)
                value = sequence_shape_to_type[field.shape](contents)
            v_, errors_ = field.validate(value, values, loc=("body", field.alias))
            if isinstance(errors_, ErrorWrapper):
                errors.append(errors_)
            elif isinstance(errors_, list):
                errors.extend(errors_)
            else:
                values[field.name] = v_
    return values, errors
```

This corrected version of the function addresses the issue by properly handling form data with sequence-shaped values and ensures correct parsing and validation for each field.
