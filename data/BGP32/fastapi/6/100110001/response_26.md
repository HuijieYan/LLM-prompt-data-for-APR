### Analysis:
The buggy function `request_body_to_args` is responsible for extracting values from the received body based on the required parameters. The function then validates these values against the required parameters and returns a dictionary of values and a list of errors.

The function has several potential error locations:
1. The handling of sequence shapes such as lists, sets, and tuples.
2. Validation of the received body against the required parameters.
3. Handling of missing values and defaults.

The failing tests indicate that the function is not able to correctly parse Python list, set, and tuple parameters sent as form data. This leads to a mismatch in the response status code, causing the tests to fail.

### Bug Cause:
The bug in the `request_body_to_args` function is primarily related to how it handles sequence shapes such as lists, sets, and tuples in form data. The function fails to properly extract and validate these data structures, resulting in errors and incorrect responses.

### Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the function can correctly handle sequence shapes when processing form data. This involves accurately extracting values, validating them against the required parameters, and handling missing or default values appropriately.

### Corrected Function:
```python
async def request_body_to_args(
    required_params: List[ModelField],
    received_body: Optional[Union[Dict[str, Any], FormData]],
) -> Tuple[Dict[str, Any], List[ErrorWrapper]]:
    values = {}
    errors = []
    for field in required_params:
        value: Any = None
        if received_body is not None:
            if field.shape in sequence_shapes and isinstance(
                received_body, FormData
            ):
                value = received_body.getlist(field.alias)
            else:
                value = received_body.get(field.alias)
        if value is None or (isinstance(field_info, params.Form) and value == ""):
            if field.required:
                if PYDANTIC_1:
                    errors.append(
                        ErrorWrapper(MissingError(), loc=("body", field.alias))
                    )
                else:
                    errors.append(
                        ErrorWrapper(
                            MissingError(),
                            loc=("body", field.alias),
                            config=BaseConfig,
                        )
                    )
            else:
                values[field.alias] = deepcopy(field.default)
            continue
        if field.shape in sequence_shapes:
            value = sequence_shape_to_type[field.shape](value)
        v_, errors_ = field.validate(value, values, loc=("body", field.alias))
        if isinstance(errors_, ErrorWrapper):
            errors.append(errors_)
        elif isinstance(errors_, list):
            errors.extend(errors_)
        else:
            values[field.name] = v_
    return values, errors
```

This corrected function now properly handles sequence shapes like lists, sets, and tuples when processing form data. It extracts values based on the field alias, validates them against the required parameters, and handles missing values or default values correctly.

With this corrected function, the failing tests related to Python list, set, and tuple parameters as form data should pass successfully.
