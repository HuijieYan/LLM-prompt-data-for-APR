The buggy function `request_body_to_args` is unable to handle form data with Python lists, sets, or tuples correctly, resulting in a 422 error response code in the failing tests. This is likely due to the function not properly extracting the values from the form data for these specific types.

To fix this bug, you need to update the logic inside the `request_body_to_args` function to handle Python lists, sets, and tuples correctly when extracting values from the form data. Specifically, when dealing with sequence shapes, the function should retrieve the values appropriately and validate them accordingly.

Here is the corrected version of the `request_body_to_args` function:

```python
async def request_body_to_args(
    required_params: List[ModelField],
    received_body: Optional[Union[Dict[str, Any], FormData]],
) -> Tuple[Dict[str, Any], List[ErrorWrapper]]:
    values = {}
    errors = []
    
    if required_params:
        for field in required_params:
            value: Any = None
            
            if received_body is not None:
                if field.shape in sequence_shapes and isinstance(received_body, FormData):
                    if field.shape in (params.FormShape.LIST, params.FormShape.SET):
                        value = received_body.getlist(field.alias)
                    elif field.shape == params.FormShape.TUPLE:
                        value = tuple(received_body.getlist(field.alias))
                else:
                    value = received_body.get(field.alias)
                    
            if value is None or (isinstance(field_info, params.Form) and value == "") or (
                isinstance(field_info, params.Form) and field.shape in sequence_shapes and len(value) == 0
            ):
                if field.required:
                    errors.append(ErrorWrapper(MissingError(), loc=("body", field.alias))
                else:
                    values[field.name] = deepcopy(field.default)
                continue
            
            ...
                      
    return values, errors
```

In this corrected version, the function is modified to properly handle form data when dealing with Python lists, sets, and tuples. With these changes, the function should now correctly extract values from the form data and pass the test cases without throwing a 422 error response.
