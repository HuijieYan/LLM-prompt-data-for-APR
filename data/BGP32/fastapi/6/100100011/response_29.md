### Analysis:
The buggy function `request_body_to_args` is responsible for extracting values from a request body and validating them. It seems to have an issue handling sequence shapes like lists, sets, and tuples when the request data is of FormData type.

### Potential Errors:
1. The function may not be correctly handling sequence shapes like lists, sets, and tuples when retrieving values from FormData in the request body.
2. There could be an issue with how values are being validated and extracted from FormData for sequence shapes.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is likely caused by the function not handling the parsing and extraction of values from FormData correctly, especially when dealing with sequence shapes and values for keys like "items".

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the function correctly handles sequence shapes like lists, sets, and tuples when retrieving values from FormData. The function should treat repeated keys properly and collect them as lists before validation.

### Corrected Function:
```python
async def request_body_to_args(
    required_params: List[ModelField],
    received_body: Optional[Union[Dict[str, Any], FormData]],
) -> Tuple[Dict[str, Any], List[ErrorWrapper]]:
    values = {}
    errors = []

    if received_body is None:
        received_body = {}

    for field in required_params:
        value = received_body.get(field.alias)

        if value is None:
            if field.required:
                errors.append(ErrorWrapper(MissingError(), loc=("body", field.alias)))
            else:
                values[field.alias] = deepcopy(field.default)
            continue

        if field.shape in sequence_shapes and isinstance(received_body, FormData):
            if value is not None:
                value = received_body.getlist(field.alias)

        if isinstance(field_info, params.File) and lenient_issubclass(field.type_, bytes) and isinstance(
            value, sequence_types
        ):
            awaitables = [sub_value.read() for sub_value in value]
            value = await asyncio.gather(*awaitables)

        v_, errors_ = field.validate(value, values, loc=("body", field.alias))

        if isinstance(errors_, ErrorWrapper):
            errors.append(errors_)
        elif isinstance(errors_, list):
            errors.extend(errors_)
        else:
            values[field.alias] = v_

    return values, errors
```

The corrected function adjusts the handling of values from FormData and addresses the potential issues with sequence shapes when validating values. This correction should address the bug and allow the function to handle sequence shapes like lists, sets, and tuples correctly when processing the request body data.
