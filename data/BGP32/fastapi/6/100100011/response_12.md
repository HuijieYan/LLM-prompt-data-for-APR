### Analysis:
The buggy function `request_body_to_args` is responsible for converting the received body parameters to arguments based on the required parameters specified. The bug seems to be related to handling non-typing sequences like lists, sets, and tuples in the received body parameters.

### Identified Issues:
1. When handling non-typing sequences in the received body:
   - The function does not correctly extract the values for sequence-shaped fields.
   - There is no specific logic to handle non-typing sequences like lists as form data.

### Cause of the Bug:
The `request_body_to_args` function fails to correctly process non-typing sequences in the received body parameters. This leads to incorrect parsing and validation of data when dealing with form data containing non-typing sequences.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To resolve the bug and address the GitHub issue related to supporting repeated key=value pairs in form data, changes need to be made to properly handle non-typing sequences like lists, sets, and tuples when parsing the received body parameters.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
Here is the corrected version of the `request_body_to_args` function:

```python
async def request_body_to_args(
    required_params: List[ModelField],
    received_body: Optional[Union[Dict[str, Any], FormData]],
) -> Tuple[Dict[str, Any], List[ErrorWrapper]]:
    values = {}
    errors = []
    
    if required_params:
        for field in required_params:
            value = None

            if received_body is not None:
                if isinstance(received_body, FormData):
                    if field.shape in sequence_shapes:
                        value = received_body.getlist(field.alias)
                    else:
                        value = received_body.get(field.alias)

            if value is None or (isinstance(field.info, params.Form) and value == ""):
                if field.required:
                    if PYDANTIC_1:
                        errors.append(
                            ErrorWrapper(MissingError(), loc=("body", field.alias))
                        )
                    else:
                        errors.append(
                            ErrorWrapper(MissingError(), loc=("body", field.alias), config=BaseConfig)
                        )
                else:
                    values[field.name] = deepcopy(field.default)
            else:
                if field.shape in sequence_shapes:
                    value = sequence_shape_to_type[field.shape](value)
                    
                if isinstance(field.info, params.File) and lenient_issubclass(field.type_, bytes):
                    if isinstance(value, UploadFile):
                        value = await value.read()
                    elif isinstance(value, sequence_types):
                        awaitables = [sub_value.read() for sub_value in value]
                        contents = await asyncio.gather(*awaitables)
                        value = sequence_shape_to_type[field.shape](contents)
                
                v_, errors_ = field.validate(value, values, loc=("body", field.alias))
                
                if isinstance(errors_, ErrorWrapper):
                    errors.append(errors_)
                elif isinstance(errors_, list):
                    errors.extend(errors_)
                else:
                    values[field.name] = v_
                    
    return values, errors
```

In this corrected version, the function now properly handles non-typing sequences in the received body parameters, ensuring correct parsing and validation of the data.

This corrected version should address the bug and enable the function to pass the failing tests related to processing non-typing sequences like lists, sets, and tuples in form data. It should also align with the expected behavior described in the GitHub issue regarding supporting repeated key=value pairs in form data.
