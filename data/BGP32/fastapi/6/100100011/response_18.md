Based on the provided buggy function and the failing test, it seems that the issue lies in handling repeated keys in form data which are supposed to be assigned as a list to the same key before validation. The current implementation only considers the last value for repeated keys, leading to validation issues.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the `request_body_to_args` function to properly handle repeated keys in form data and correctly assign them as a list. We can achieve this by updating the logic inside the function to iterate over all values for a repeated key and collect them as a list before validation.

Here is the corrected version of the `request_body_to_args` function:

```python
async def request_body_to_args(
    required_params: List[ModelField],
    received_body: Optional[Union[Dict[str, Any], FormData]],
) -> Tuple[Dict[str, Any], List[ErrorWrapper]]:
    values = {}
    errors = []

    for field in required_params:
        value: Any = None
        if received_body is not None:
            if field.shape in sequence_shapes and isinstance(received_body, FormData):
                value = received_body.getlist(field.alias)
            else:
                value = received_body.get(field.alias)

        if value is None and field.required:
            if PYDANTIC_1:
                errors.append(ErrorWrapper(MissingError(), loc=("body", field.alias)))
            else:
                errors.append(ErrorWrapper(MissingError(), loc=("body", field.alias), config=BaseConfig))
        else:
            if isinstance(value, list):
                values[field.name] = [await field.validate(v, values, loc=("body", field.alias))[0] for v in value]
            else:
                v_, errors_ = field.validate(value, values, loc=("body", field.alias))
                if isinstance(errors_, ErrorWrapper):
                    errors.append(errors_)
                elif isinstance(errors_, list):
                    errors.extend(errors_)
                else:
                    values[field.name] = v_

    return values, errors
```

This corrected version of the function now correctly handles repeated keys in form data by collecting all values associated with a key as a list and then validating each value accordingly.

With this fix, the failing test cases `test_python_list_param_as_form`, `test_python_set_param_as_form`, and `test_python_tuple_param_as_form` should pass as expected.
