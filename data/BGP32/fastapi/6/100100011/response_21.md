### Analysis:
The buggy function `request_body_to_args` is responsible for extracting values from the request body based on the required parameters and validating them. The function seems to have issues handling sequence shapes like lists, sets, and tuples when processing form data.

### Error Locations:
1. The handling of sequence shapes and form data extraction is causing issues for the functions.
2. Validation and handling of multiple repeated keys in form data are missing.

### Cause of the Bug:
The bug is causing issues because the function doesn't correctly handle the extraction and validation process for sequence shapes (like lists, sets, tuples) from form data. This leads to incorrect processing and validation, resulting in failing tests.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to update the function to properly handle sequence shapes and form data extraction. The function should support processing multiple values for the same key in form data and assign them as a list for validation.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
Below is the corrected version of the `request_body_to_args` function:

```python
async def request_body_to_args(
    required_params: List[ModelField],
    received_body: Optional[Union[Dict[str, Any], FormData]],
) -> Tuple[Dict[str, Any], List[ErrorWrapper]]:
    values = {}
    errors = []
    form_params = {}
    
    if received_body is not None:
        if isinstance(received_body, FormData):
            for key, value in received_body.items():
                if key not in form_params:
                    form_params[key] = value
                else:
                    if isinstance(form_params[key], list):
                        form_params[key].append(value)
                    else:
                        form_params[key] = [form_params[key], value]
    
    for field in required_params:
        field_info = get_field_info(field)
        if field.alias in form_params:
            value = form_params[field.alias]
            if field.shape in sequence_shapes:
                if not isinstance(value, list):
                    value = [value]
                
                if isinstance(field_info, params.File) and lenient_issubclass(field.type_, bytes):
                    contents = await asyncio.gather(*[sub_value.read() for sub_value in value])
                    value = sequence_shape_to_type[field.shape](contents)
            
            v_, errors_ = field.validate(value, values, loc=("body", field.alias))
            if isinstance(errors_, ErrorWrapper):
                errors.append(errors_)
            elif isinstance(errors_, list):
                errors.extend(errors_)
            else:
                values[field.name] = v_
        elif field.required:
            errors.append(ErrorWrapper(MissingError(), loc=("body", field.alias))
        else:
            values[field.name] = deepcopy(field.default)
    
    return values, errors
```

### Explanation:
The updated function now correctly handles form data extraction for sequence shapes. It collects all values for the same key in a dictionary, ensuring repeated keys are handled. It then processes these values based on the required parameters, supporting lists, sets, and tuples. This fix should resolve the failing tests and address the issue reported on GitHub.
