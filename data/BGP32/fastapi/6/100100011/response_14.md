### Analysis:
The `request_body_to_args` function is responsible for extracting values from a request body based on required parameters and validating them. The bug seems to be related to handling repeated keys in form data, as mentioned in the GitHub issue.

### Error Identification:
The bug may be located in the section where the function processes values from the form data while looking for the required parameters. Specifically, the handling of repeated keys may not account for multiple values correctly.

### Cause of the Bug:
The bug arises from the fact that when handling repeated keys in form data, only the last value is retained, leading to issues with parameter validation in FastAPI. This issue violates the expectations of users who intend to validate against all values provided for a specific key.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To address this bug and align with the GitHub issue's request, we need to update the logic within the `request_body_to_args` function to collect all values associated with a repeated key and create a list of values for validation instead of only considering the last value.

### Bug Fixed Version:
Below is the corrected version of the `request_body_to_args` function that resolves the bug by collecting all values for repeated keys and ensuring that the validation process includes all values as expected.

```python
async def request_body_to_args(
    required_params: List[ModelField],
    received_body: Optional[Union[Dict[str, Any], FormData]],
) -> Tuple[Dict[str, Any], List[ErrorWrapper]]:
    values = {}
    errors = []
    if required_params:
        for field in required_params:
            value: Any = None
            if received_body is not None:
                if field.shape in sequence_shapes and isinstance(received_body, FormData):
                    if isinstance(received_body, FormData):
                        values[field.name] = received_body.getlist(field.alias)
                    else:
                        values[field.name] = [received_body.get(field.alias)]
                else:
                    value = received_body.get(field.alias)
                    if field.shape in sequence_shapes and field.type_ in sequence_types:
                        values[field.name] = [value]
            if value is None or (
                isinstance(field_info, params.Form) and value == ""
            ):
                if field.required:
                    if PYDANTIC_1:
                        errors.append(
                            ErrorWrapper(MissingError(), loc=("body", field.alias))
                        )
                    else:  # pragma: nocover
                        errors.append(
                            ErrorWrapper(  # type: ignore
                                MissingError(),
                                loc=("body", field.alias),
                                config=BaseConfig,
                            )
                        )
                else:
                    values[field.name] = deepcopy(field.default)
                continue

            v_, errors_ = field.validate(value, values, loc=("body", field.alias))
            if isinstance(errors_, ErrorWrapper):
                errors.append(errors_)
            elif isinstance(errors_, list):
                errors.extend(errors_)
            else:
                values[field.name] = v_

    return values, errors
```

This corrected version of the function should now handle repeated keys in form data correctly, enabling validation against all values for a given key, as requested in the GitHub issue.
