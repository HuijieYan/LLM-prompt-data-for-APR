### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `request_body_to_args` is responsible for extracting values from the `received_body` and validating them against the `required_params`.
2. The bug might be related to handling sequence shapes like lists, sets, and tuples when extracting values from the `received_body`.
3. The failing test cases involve posting data with items in a list format and expecting the response to reflect the same structure. However, the current implementation doesn't handle this correctly.
4. The GitHub issue mentions the need to support repeated key=value pairs in form data, indicating a similar scenario to what the failing tests are trying to achieve.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is likely caused by the incorrect handling of sequence shapes like lists in the `received_body`. The function does not properly extract and process values when dealing with sequences in form data.

### Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to update the logic for handling sequence shapes like lists in the `received_body`. The function should correctly extract and validate values for repeated keys in form data as mentioned in the GitHub issue.

### Corrected Version:
```python
async def request_body_to_args(
    required_params: List[ModelField],
    received_body: Optional[Union[Dict[str, Any], FormData]],
) -> Tuple[Dict[str, Any], List[ErrorWrapper]]:
    values = {}
    errors = []
    if required_params:
        for field in required_params:
            value: Any = None
            if received_body is not None:
                if field.shape in sequence_shapes and isinstance(
                    received_body, FormData
                ):
                    if field.alias in received_body.keys():
                        if field.shape == Sequence:
                            value = received_body.getlist(field.alias)
                        else:
                            value = received_body.get(field.alias)
            if value is None:
                if field.required:
                    if PYDANTIC_1:
                        errors.append(
                            ErrorWrapper(MissingError(), loc=("body", field.alias))
                        )
                    else:  # pragma: nocover
                        errors.append(
                            ErrorWrapper(
                                MissingError(),
                                loc=("body", field.alias),
                                config=BaseConfig,
                            )
                        )
                else:
                    values[field.name] = deepcopy(field.default)
            else:
                if (
                    isinstance(field_info, params.File)
                    and lenient_issubclass(field.type_, bytes)
                    and isinstance(value, UploadFile)
                ):
                    value = await value.read()
                v_, errors_ = field.validate(value, values, loc=("body", field.alias))
                if isinstance(errors_, ErrorWrapper):
                    errors.append(errors_)
                elif isinstance(errors_, list):
                    errors.extend(errors_)
                else:
                    values[field.name] = v_
    return values, errors
```

In the corrected version, we check if the `field.alias` exists in the keys of the `received_body`, and based on the shape of the field, we appropriately handle extracting values. This fix should address the issue with processing sequence shapes like lists in the form data.
