### Analysis:
1. The `request_body_to_args` function is responsible for converting request body parameters into arguments. It iterates over required parameters, extracts values from the received body, performs validations, and handles different cases such as form data and file uploads.
2. The bug might be related to how the function handles sequence shapes (lists, sets, tuples) in the input data.
3. The failing tests suggest that when sending a list of items in the request body, the function may not handle them correctly, leading to incorrect validation and result.
4. To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the function correctly handles sequence shapes when processing form data. We need to identify the issue related to parsing lists, sets, and tuples from form data correctly.
5. The bug might not correctly handle the scenarios where a list is expected as form data. This can be fixed by modifying how the function processes the "shape in sequence_shapes" condition and extracts the list data from the form data correctly.

### Correction:
```python
async def request_body_to_args(
    required_params: List[ModelField],
    received_body: Optional[Union[Dict[str, Any], FormData]],
) -> Tuple[Dict[str, Any], List[ErrorWrapper]]:
    values = {}
    errors = []
    if required_params:
        for field in required_params:
            value: Any = None
            if received_body is not None:
                if field.shape in sequence_shapes and isinstance(
                    received_body, FormData
                ):
                    if field.shape == FormParametersSequence.LIST:
                        value = received_body.getlist(field.alias)
                    else:
                        value = received_body.get(field.alias)
                else:
                    value = received_body.get(field.alias)

            if value is None and field.required:
                errors.append(
                    ErrorWrapper(MissingError(), loc=("body", field.alias))
                )
            else:
                if (
                    isinstance(field_info, params.Form)
                    and lenient_issubclass(field.type_, sequence_types)
                    and isinstance(value, list)
                ):
                    value = sequence_shape_to_type[field.shape](value)
                elif isinstance(field_info, params.File) and lenient_issubclass(field.type_, bytes) and isinstance(value, UploadFile):
                    value = await value.read()
                
                v_, errors_ = field.validate(value, values, loc=("body", field.alias))
                if isinstance(errors_, ErrorWrapper):
                    errors.append(errors_)
                elif isinstance(errors_, list):
                    errors.extend(errors_)
                else:
                    values[field.name] = v_
            if not errors and field.name not in values:
                values[field.name] = deepcopy(field.default)

    return values, errors
```

In the corrected version, we have added a specific check for `field.shape == FormParametersSequence.LIST` to handle the case where a list shape is expected. Additionally, the function now correctly processes and validates the input data for different shapes based on the type of the field.

This fix should address the issue related to handling lists, sets, and tuples in the form data correctly, ensuring that the function processes the input data as expected.
