## Analysis:
1. The buggy function `request_body_to_args` is responsible for extracting values from the received body data based on the required parameters.
2. The root cause of the bug seems to be related to handling non-typing sequence shapes in the request body, leading to incorrect extraction and validation of values.
3. The failing test cases for Python list, set, and tuple as form data indicate that the function is unable to properly parse and validate these non-typing sequence shapes.
4. To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the function correctly extracts and validates values for non-typing sequence shapes like Python lists, sets, and tuples.

## Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Modify the logic for extracting values from non-typing sequence shapes in the request body to handle Python lists, sets, and tuples correctly.
2. Update the validation process to ensure that these values are properly validated and returned as expected by the tests.

## Bug Fix:
```python
async def request_body_to_args(
    required_params: List[ModelField],
    received_body: Optional[Union[Dict[str, Any], FormData]],
) -> Tuple[Dict[str, Any], List[ErrorWrapper]]:

    values = {}
    errors = []

    for field in required_params:
        value: Any = None
        if received_body is not None:
            if field.shape in sequence_shapes and isinstance(received_body, FormData):
                value = received_body.getlist(field.alias)
            else:
                value = received_body.get(field.alias) if received_body else None

        if value is None:
            if field.required:
                errors.append(ErrorWrapper(MissingError(), loc=("body", field.alias)))
            else:
                values[field.name] = deepcopy(field.default)
        else:
            v_, errors_ = field.validate(value, values, loc=("body", field.alias))
            if isinstance(errors_, ErrorWrapper):
                errors.append(errors_)
            elif isinstance(errors_, list):
                errors.extend(errors_)
            else:
                values[field.name] = v_

    return values, errors
```

By updating the extraction and validation logic within the `request_body_to_args` function, we ensure correct handling of non-typing sequence shapes like Python lists, sets, and tuples. This fix should address the issue reported in the GitHub post and make the failing test cases pass successfully.
