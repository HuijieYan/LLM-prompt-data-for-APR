## Analysis:
- The `request_body_to_args` function is responsible for converting the received body (request data) into arguments based on the required params provided.
- The function checks for the presence of required params and processes the received body accordingly, handling various cases like files, sequences, etc.
- The function seems to have issues with handling repeated keys/values in form data, as mentioned in the GitHub issue related to supporting repeated key=value pairs in form data.

## Potential Error Locations:
- The issue might be related to how the function processes form data with repeated keys/values, as mentioned in the GitHub issue description.
- Specifically, the logic related to handling form data sequences and values for each field could be causing the problem.

## Cause of the Bug:
- The bug seems to stem from how the function handles form data with repeated keys in the `request_body_to_args` function.
- When there are multiple values for the same key in the form data, the function might not be correctly processing and assigning them as a list or a suitable data structure to the same key before validation.

## Bug Fix Strategy:
- To fix the bug, we need to update the logic within the `request_body_to_args` function to correctly handle repeated keys/values in form data.
- The function should group repeated key-values pairs and process them as lists or appropriate data structures before validation.
- Additionally, we need to ensure that the function correctly handles sequences like lists, tuples, sets when processing form data.

## Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
async def request_body_to_args(
    required_params: List[ModelField],
    received_body: Optional[Union[Dict[str, Any], FormData]],
) -> Tuple[Dict[str, Any], List[ErrorWrapper]]:
    values = {}
    errors = []
    
    for field in required_params:
        alias = field.alias
        value: Any = None
        
        if received_body is not None:
            if field.shape in sequence_shapes and isinstance(received_body, FormData):
                values[alias] = received_body.getlist(alias)
            elif field.shape in sequence_shapes:
                values[alias] = received_body.getlist(alias) if received_body.getlist(alias) else []
            else:
                value = received_body.get(alias)
                
            if value is None or (isinstance(field_info, params.Form) and value == ""):
                if field.required:
                    errors.append(ErrorWrapper(MissingError(), loc=("body", alias))
                else:
                    values[field.name] = deepcopy(field.default)
            else:
                if isinstance(field_info, params.File) and lenient_issubclass(field.type_, bytes) and isinstance(value, UploadFile):
                    value = await value.read()
                v_, errors_ = field.validate(value, values, loc=("body", alias))
                if isinstance(errors_, ErrorWrapper):
                    errors.append(errors_)
                elif isinstance(errors_, list):
                    errors.extend(errors_)
                else:
                    values[field.name] = v_
    
    return values, errors
```

The corrected version of the function includes updates to handle repeated key-values pairs in form data correctly before validation. It ensures that all values for the same key are processed as lists or appropriate data structures.
