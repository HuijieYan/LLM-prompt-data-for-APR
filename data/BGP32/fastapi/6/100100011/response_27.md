### Analysis:
1. The `request_body_to_args` function is responsible for extracting values from the received body based on the required parameters.
2. The bug seems related to handling sequence-shaped fields (such as lists, sets, tuples) within the received body.
3. The failing tests indicate that the function is not correctly handling sequence-shaped fields sent in form data.
4. To fix the bug, we need to adjust the logic for extracting values from sequence-shaped fields.

### Bug cause:
- The bug arises when processing sequence-shaped fields from the received body.
- The current implementation does not properly extract values like lists, sets, and tuples, leading to incorrect validation.

### Strategy for fixing the bug:
1. Check if the field is a sequence shape and handle it appropriately.
2. For sequence-shaped fields, ensure that the values are extracted correctly.
3. Modify the logic to handle these sequence shapes and validate them accordingly.

### Corrected Version:
```python
from fastapi.dependencies.utils import sequence_shapes

async def request_body_to_args(
    required_params: List[ModelField],
    received_body: Optional[Union[Dict[str, Any], FormData]],
) -> Tuple[Dict[str, Any], List[ErrorWrapper]]:
    values = {}
    errors = []
    if required_params:
        for field in required_params:
            value: Any = None
            if received_body is not None:
                if field.shape in sequence_shapes and isinstance(received_body, FormData):
                    if field.shape in ["list", "set", "tuple"]:
                        value = received_body.getlist(field.alias)
                    elif field.shape == "dict":
                        value = dict(received_body)
                    else:
                        value = received_body.get(field.alias)
                else:
                    value = received_body.get(field.alias)
            if value is not None and field.shape == "set":
                value = set(value)
            if value is None:
                if field.required:
                    if PYDANTIC_1:
                        errors.append(
                            ErrorWrapper(MissingError(), loc=("body", field.alias))
                        )
                    else:  
                        errors.append(
                            ErrorWrapper(MissingError(), loc=("body", field.alias), config=BaseConfig)
                        )
                else:
                    values[field.name] = deepcopy(field.default)
            else:
                if isinstance(field_info, params.File) and lenient_issubclass(field.type_, bytes):
                    if isinstance(value, UploadFile):
                        value = await value.read()
                    else:
                        awaitables = [sub_value.read() for sub_value in value]
                        contents = await asyncio.gather(*awaitables)
                        value = sequence_shape_to_type[field.shape](contents)
                v_, errors_ = field.validate(value, values, loc=("body", field.alias))
                if isinstance(errors_, ErrorWrapper):
                    errors.append(errors_)
                elif isinstance(errors_, list):
                    errors.extend(errors_)
                else:
                    values[field.name] = v_
    return values, errors
```

### With this corrected version, the function should now properly extract and validate sequence-shaped fields from the received body, resolving the bug and passing the failing tests.
