## Analysis:
The `request_body_to_args` function is responsible for converting the received body data into arguments, handling various scenarios such as handling files, validating values, and handling sequences. The bug seems to stem from how the function processes sequences in the request body, leading to validation errors and incorrect data handling.

## Bug Description:
The bug occurs when the function encounters sequences in the form data, such as lists, sets, or tuples. It fails to correctly handle these sequences, leading to validation errors and incorrect handling of the data. This results in the failing test cases where the test data includes sequences like lists.

## Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the function correctly handles sequences in the form data. This involves properly extracting and processing the values from the sequences, validating them, and storing them in the output dictionary.

## Corrected Function:
Here is the corrected version of the `request_body_to_args` function:

```python
async def request_body_to_args(
    required_params: List[ModelField],
    received_body: Optional[Union[Dict[str, Any], FormData]],
) -> Tuple[Dict[str, Any], List[ErrorWrapper]]:
    values = {}
    errors = []
    if required_params:
        for field in required_params:
            value = None
            if received_body is not None:
                if field.shape in sequence_shapes and isinstance(received_body, FormData):
                    value = received_body.getlist(field.alias)
                else:
                    value = received_body.get(field.alias)
            
            if value is None:
                if field.required:
                    errors.append(ErrorWrapper(MissingError(), loc=("body", field.alias)))
                else:
                    values[field.name] = deepcopy(field.default)
                continue
            
            if isinstance(field_info, params.File) and lenient_issubclass(field.type_, bytes) and isinstance(value, UploadFile):
                value = await value.read()
            else:
                if field.shape in sequence_shapes:
                    if not isinstance(value, list):
                        value = [value]
                    awaitables = [sub_value.read() if isinstance(sub_value, UploadFile) else sub_value for sub_value in value]
                    contents = await asyncio.gather(*awaitables)
                    value = contents
                
            v_, errors_ = field.validate(value, values, loc=("body", field.alias))
            if isinstance(errors_, (ErrorWrapper, list)):
                errors.extend(errors_)

            values[field.name] = v_
    return values, errors
```

This corrected version ensures that sequences are properly extracted and processed from the form data, handling lists, sets, and tuples correctly for validation and value assignment.

By implementing this corrected version, the `request_body_to_args` function should now correctly handle sequences in the form data and pass the failing test cases provided.
