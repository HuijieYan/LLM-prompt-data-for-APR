## Analysis:
The buggy function `request_body_to_args` is responsible for extracting values from the request body and validating them against the required parameters. The function iterates over the required parameters and attempts to retrieve values from the received body based on the field aliases. If a value is missing, it adds an error to the list of errors.

The buggy function in its current form may not handle repeated keys in form data correctly, leading to incorrect validation and missing values.

## Error Location:
The potential error locations in the buggy function are:
1. Handling of repeated keys in form data.
2. Processing of value for the field.

## Cause of the Bug:
The bug arises from the function not correctly handling repeated keys in form data. When multiple values are associated with the same key in the form data, the current implementation only considers the last value for that key. This behavior contradicts the expected behavior when dealing with sequences like Python lists, sets, and tuples.

As a result, the tests that expect `response.json()` to be equal to a Python list, set, or tuple fail because the function only captures the last value in the case of repeated keys.

## Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, the function should be updated to handle repeated keys in form data correctly. When encountering such cases, it should aggregate the values associated with the same key into a list and assign that list to the corresponding field alias for validation.

By modifying the logic to properly handle repeated keys in form data, the function can accurately extract values for fields that expect non-typing sequences like Python lists, sets, or tuples.

## Corrected Version of the Function:
Here is the corrected version of the `request_body_to_args` function:

```python
async def request_body_to_args(
    required_params: List[ModelField],
    received_body: Optional[Union[Dict[str, Any], FormData]],
) -> Tuple[Dict[str, Any], List[ErrorWrapper]]:
    values = {}
    errors = []

    if received_body is None:
        return values, errors

    for field in required_params:
        value: Any = None
        if field.alias in received_body:
            value = received_body.getlist(field.alias) if isinstance(received_body, FormData) else received_body.get(field.alias)

        if value is None:
            if field.required:
                if PYDANTIC_1:
                    errors.append(
                        ErrorWrapper(MissingError(), loc=("body", field.alias))
                    )
                else:  
                    errors.append(
                        ErrorWrapper(MissingError(), loc=("body", field.alias), config=BaseConfig)
                    )
            else:
                values[field.name] = deepcopy(field.default)
        else:
            v_, errors_ = field.validate(value, values, loc=("body", field.alias))
            if isinstance(errors_, ErrorWrapper):
                errors.append(errors_)
            elif isinstance(errors_, list):
                errors.extend(errors_)
            else:
                values[field.name] = v_

    return values, errors
```

In the corrected version, we ensure that if a field alias has multiple values in the form data, we retrieve all of them using `received_body.getlist(field.alias)` and utilize these values correctly during validation. This change allows the function to handle repeated keys properly, ensuring that the validation against non-typing sequences will work as expected.
