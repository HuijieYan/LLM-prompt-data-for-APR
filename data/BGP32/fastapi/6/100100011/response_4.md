### Analysis:
1. The `request_body_to_args` function is designed to convert received body data (either a dictionary or `FormData` object) into a dictionary of values and a list of errors based on the required parameters.
2. The function checks each required parameter and attempts to retrieve the corresponding value from the received body. If the value is missing or doesn't meet certain criteria, errors are added.
3. The function has a specific handling for files, sequences, and form parameters.
4. The failing test cases involve posting data where the `items` field is expected to be converted into a list and not handled correctly due to the buggy function.

### Bug Explanation:
The bug lies in how the function handles the case where a field is a sequence type (e.g., list, set, tuple) and is treated as a form parameter. The function does not account for converting the received data into the correct sequence type, leading to incorrect handling and validation.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to modify the implementation of the function to properly handle converting form data into sequence types like lists, sets, and tuples. This involves properly extracting and processing the values associated with sequence fields from the received body data.

### Corrected Version of the function:
```python
async def request_body_to_args(
    required_params: List[ModelField],
    received_body: Optional[Union[Dict[str, Any], FormData]],
) -> Tuple[Dict[str, Any], List[ErrorWrapper]]:
    values = {}
    errors = []
    if required_params:
        for field in required_params:
            value: Any = None
            if received_body is not None:
                if field.shape in sequence_shapes and isinstance(
                    received_body, FormData
                ):
                    if field.shape == FormSequenceType.LIST:
                        value = received_body.getlist(field.alias)
                    elif field.shape == FormSequenceType.SET:
                        value = set(received_body.getlist(field.alias))
                    elif field.shape == FormSequenceType.TUPLE:
                        value = tuple(received_body.getlist(field.alias))
                else:
                    value = received_body.get(field.alias)
            if (
                value is None
                or (isinstance(field_info, params.Form) and value == "")
                or (
                    isinstance(field_info, params.Form)
                    and field.shape in sequence_shapes
                    and len(value) == 0
                )
            ):
                if field.required:
                    if PYDANTIC_1:
                        errors.append(
                            ErrorWrapper(MissingError(), loc=("body", field.alias))
                        )
                    else:  # pragma: nocover
                        errors.append(
                            ErrorWrapper(  # type: ignore
                                MissingError(),
                                loc=("body", field.alias),
                                config=BaseConfig,
                            )
                        )
                else:
                    values[field.name] = deepcopy(field.default)
                continue
            if (
                isinstance(field_info, params.File)
                and lenient_issubclass(field.type_, bytes)
                and isinstance(value, UploadFile)
            ):
                value = await value.read()
            v_, errors_ = field.validate(value, values, loc=("body", field.alias))
            if isinstance(errors_, ErrorWrapper):
                errors.append(errors_)
            elif isinstance(errors_, list):
                errors.extend(errors_)
            else:
                values[field.name] = v_
    return values, errors

```

### Changes Made:
1. Added logic to handle different sequence types (LIST, SET, TUPLE) based on the `FormSequenceType`.
2. Extracted values correctly from the form data for different sequence types.
3. Updated the validation step to convert received sequence data into the expected sequence type.

By making these changes, the corrected version of the function should now properly handle form data conversion for sequence types and resolve the issue with processing form parameters as lists, sets, or tuples.
