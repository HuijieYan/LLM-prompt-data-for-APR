### Analysis:
This function `request_body_to_args` is used to convert the body of a request into arguments based on the required parameters. It iterates over the required parameters, checks if the values in the received body match the expected types, and validates them. The function also handles cases where values are missing, empty strings, or need to be read as bytes.

### Potential Error Locations:
1. Handling of embedded fields within the body.
2. Conditions for checking if a value is required.
3. Checking if a value is an instance of `UploadFile`.
4. Handling sequences of files and bytes.

### Bug Cause:
The bug in the function is related to handling embedded fields within the body. If there is only one required parameter and it's not an embedded field, the received body is mistakenly transformed into a dictionary where the key is the alias of the field. This incorrect transformation of the received body causes issues later in the function.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the received body is not transformed into a dictionary if there is only one required parameter and it's not an embedded field. Instead, the function should handle the received body appropriately based on the required parameter and its shape.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
async def request_body_to_args(
    required_params: List[ModelField],
    received_body: Optional[Union[Dict[str, Any], FormData]],
) -> Tuple[Dict[str, Any], List[ErrorWrapper]]:
    values = {}
    errors = []
    if required_params:
        if len(required_params) == 1 and not get_field_info(required_params[0]).embed:
            field = required_params[0]
            for field in required_params:
                value = None
                if received_body is not None:
                    if field.shape in sequence_shapes and isinstance(received_body, FormData):
                        value = received_body.getlist(field.alias)
                    else:
                        value = received_body.get(field.alias)
                if (
                    value is None
                    or (isinstance(get_field_info(field), params.Form) and value == "")
                    or (
                        isinstance(get_field_info(field), params.Form)
                        and field.shape in sequence_shapes
                        and len(value) == 0
                    )
                ):
                    if field.required:
                        errors.append(
                            ErrorWrapper(MissingError(), loc=("body", field.alias))
                        )
                    else:
                        values[field.name] = deepcopy(field.default)
                    continue
                if (
                    isinstance(get_field_info(field), params.File)
                    and lenient_issubclass(field.type_, bytes)
                    and isinstance(value, UploadFile)
                ):
                    value = await value.read()
                elif (
                    field.shape in sequence_shapes
                    and isinstance(get_field_info(field), params.File)
                    and lenient_issubclass(field.type_, bytes)
                    and isinstance(value, sequence_types)
                ):
                    awaitables = [sub_value.read() for sub_value in value]
                    contents = await asyncio.gather(*awaitables)
                    value = sequence_shape_to_type[field.shape](contents)
                v_, errors_ = field.validate(value, values, loc=("body", field.alias))
                if isinstance(errors_, ErrorWrapper):
                    errors.append(errors_)
                elif isinstance(errors_, list):
                    errors.extend(errors_)
                else:
                    values[field.name] = v_
                return values, errors
```

### Changes Made:
1. Removed incorrect conditional block that transformed the received body into a dictionary if there's only one required parameter.
2. Used `get_field_info` function to get field information instead of directly accessing the field's information.
3. Reorganized the structure of the code to maintain consistency and readability.
