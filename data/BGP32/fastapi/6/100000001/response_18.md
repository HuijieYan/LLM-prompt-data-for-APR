## Analysis:
The buggy function `request_body_to_args` is intended to process and validate a request body against a list of required parameters. However, there are several potential error locations within the function that may cause unexpected behavior or errors:
1. The condition for checking if the received form data is empty or missing may not work as intended.
2. The handling of file uploads and sequences of values may lead to incorrect processing.
3. Error generation and handling may not conform to the expected behavior.
4. The validation and assignment of values to the final dictionary may have issues.

## Bug Cause:
The bug in the function arises from incorrect handling of form data, file uploads, sequence shapes, and error generation. These issues can result in missing or incorrect parameter values being assigned to the final dictionary, errors being generated incorrectly, and unexpected behavior during validation.

## Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug in the function, the following steps can be taken:
1. Ensure that the logic for checking empty or missing form data is corrected.
2. Review the handling of file uploads and sequences to ensure proper processing.
3. Adjust the error generation and handling to conform to the expected behavior.
4. Verify the validation and assignment of values to the final dictionary for correctness.

## Corrected Version:
```python
async def request_body_to_args(
    required_params: List[ModelField],
    received_body: Optional[Union[Dict[str, Any], FormData]],
) -> Tuple[Dict[str, Any], List[ErrorWrapper]]:
    values = {}
    errors = []
    sequence_shapes = {"list", "tuple"}
    sequence_types = (list, tuple)

    for field in required_params:
        value: Any = None
        if received_body is not None:
            if field.shape in sequence_shapes and isinstance(received_body, FormData):
                value = received_body.getlist(field.alias)
            else:
                value = received_body.get(field.alias)

        if value is None or (isinstance(field.type_, str) and value == "") or (
            field.shape in sequence_shapes and len(value) == 0
        ):
            if field.required:
                errors.append(ErrorWrapper(MissingError(), loc=("body", field.alias))
                if not PYDANTIC_1:
                    errors[-1] = errors[-1].locate(BaseConfig)
            else:
                values[field.name] = deepcopy(field.default)
        else:
            if isinstance(field_info.default, str):
                value = cast(str, value)
            if (
                isinstance(field_info, params.File)
                and lenient_issubclass(field.type_, bytes)
                and isinstance(value, UploadFile)
            ):
                value = await value.read()
            elif (
                field.shape in sequence_shapes
                and isinstance(field_info, params.File)
                and lenient_issubclass(field.type_, bytes)
                and isinstance(value, sequence_types)
            ):
                awaitables = [sub_value.read() for sub_value in value]
                contents = await asyncio.gather(*awaitables)
                value = sequence_shape_to_type[field.shape](contents)
            v_, errors_ = field.validate(value, values, loc=("body", field.alias))
            if isinstance(errors_, ErrorWrapper):
                errors.append(errors_)
            elif isinstance(errors_, list):
                errors.extend(errors_)
            else:
                values[field.name] = v_

    return values, errors
```
In the corrected version of the function, the logic for handling empty or missing form data has been adjusted, error generation has been refined, and the processing of file uploads and sequences has been corrected. This should help address the potential issues identified in the buggy function.
