### Analysis:
The `request_body_to_args` function is intended to extract values from a request body based on the required parameters provided and validate them against the required parameter definitions. The function processes a list of `required_params` and a `received_body` input to generate values and errors.

### Bugs:
1. In the loop that processes each `field` in `required_params`, the `field_info` is extracted only once outside the loop. This can cause the `field_info` to become outdated as the loop progresses, leading to incorrect validations.
2. The condition to check for an empty value in case of a required field is not correctly structured and may lead to incorrect error handling.
3. The logic for handling file fields and sequence shapes seems to be flawed and not properly enforced.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Move the extraction of `field_info` inside the loop to ensure that each `field` is associated with the correct `field_info`.
2. Update the condition to properly handle empty values for required fields.
3. Revise the logic related to file fields and sequence shapes for proper validation.

### Bug-Free Function:
```python
async def request_body_to_args(
    required_params: List[ModelField],
    received_body: Optional[Union[Dict[str, Any], FormData]],
) -> Tuple[Dict[str, Any], List[ErrorWrapper]]:
    values = {}
    errors = []
    if required_params:
        for field in required_params:
            field_info = get_field_info(field)
            embed = getattr(field_info, "embed", None)
            if len(required_params) == 1 and not embed:
                received_body = {field.alias: received_body}
            value: Any = None
            if received_body is not None:
                if field.shape in sequence_shapes and isinstance(
                    received_body, FormData
                ):
                    value = received_body.getlist(field.alias)
                else:
                    value = received_body.get(field.alias)
            if value is None or value == "":
                if field.required:
                    errors.append(
                        ErrorWrapper(MissingError(), loc=("body", field.alias))
                    )
                else:
                    values[field.name] = deepcopy(field.default)
                continue
            if isinstance(field_info, params.File) and isinstance(value, UploadFile):
                value = await value.read()
            elif field.shape in sequence_shapes and isinstance(field_info, params.File):
                if all(isinstance(sub_value, UploadFile) for sub_value in value):
                    awaitables = [sub_value.read() for sub_value in value]
                    contents = await asyncio.gather(*awaitables)
                    value = sequence_shape_to_type[field.shape](contents)
            v_, errors_ = field.validate(value, values, loc=("body", field.alias))
            if isinstance(errors_, ErrorWrapper):
                errors.append(errors_)
            elif isinstance(errors_, list):
                errors.extend(errors_)
            else:
                values[field.name] = v_
    return values, errors
```

This corrected version of the `request_body_to_args` function should now address the identified bugs and function as intended.
