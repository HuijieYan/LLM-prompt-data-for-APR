## Analysis of the Buggy Function:

### Identified Issues:
1. The function is overwriting the received_body variable with a modified dictionary without checking if it is already a dictionary.
2. The logic for handling sequence shapes and file uploads seems to be incorrect.
3. Error handling and error append logic may cause issues.
4. The validation and assignment of values to the output dictionary may need improvement.

### Explanation of Bug:
The bug in the function arises from the incorrect handling of the received_body variable when converting it to a dictionary. Additionally, the processing of sequence shapes and file uploads may not be functioning as intended, leading to incorrect values being extracted. Error handling and value assignment logic may also introduce unexpected issues.

### Suggested Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
1. Ensure that the received_body variable is properly checked and converted into a dictionary if necessary.
2. Revise the logic for handling sequence shapes and file uploads to correctly extract values.
3. Improve error handling and error append logic to avoid unexpected behavior.
4. Enhance the validation and assignment of values to ensure correctness.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
async def request_body_to_args(
    required_params: List[ModelField],
    received_body: Optional[Union[Dict[str, Any], FormData]],
) -> Tuple[Dict[str, Any], List[ErrorWrapper]]:
    values = {}
    errors = []
    sequence_shapes = {params.Query, params.Form}
    sequence_types = (list, set)
    sequence_shape_to_type = {
        params.Query: list,
        params.Form: dict,
    }

    if isinstance(received_body, FormData):
        received_body = dict(received_body)

    for field in required_params:
        value: Any = None
        if received_body is not None:
            if field.shape in sequence_shapes and isinstance(received_body, dict):
                value = received_body.get(field.alias)
            else:
                value = received_body.get(field.alias)

        if value is None or (field_info.shapes() and value == ""):
            if field.required:
                errors.append(ErrorWrapper(MissingError(), loc=("body", field.alias)))
            else:
                values[field.name] = field.default
        else:
            if isinstance(field_info, params.File) and lenient_issubclass(field.type_, bytes) and isinstance(value, UploadFile):
                value = await value.read()
            elif field.shape in sequence_shapes and lenient_issubclass(field.type_, bytes) and isinstance(value, sequence_types):
                awaitables = [sub_value.read() for sub_value in value]
                contents = await asyncio.gather(*awaitables)
                value = sequence_shape_to_type[field.shape](contents)

            v_, errors_ = field.validate(value, values, loc=("body", field.alias))
            if isinstance(errors_, ErrorWrapper):
                errors.append(errors_)
            elif isinstance(errors_, list):
                errors.extend(errors_)
            else:
                values[field.name] = v_

    return values, errors
```

This corrected version of the function addresses the identified issues by properly handling the conversion of received_body to a dictionary, revising the logic for sequence shapes and file uploads, enhancing error handling, and improving the validation and assignment of values.
