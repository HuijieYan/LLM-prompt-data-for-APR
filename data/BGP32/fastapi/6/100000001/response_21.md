## Analysis:
The `request_body_to_args` function is designed to convert received body data into arguments based on required parameters for a FastAPI endpoint. The function iterates over each required parameter, retrieves the corresponding value from the received body data, and performs validations and conversions according to the parameter's type.

## Identified potential errors:
1. In the code block where the received body is updated for a single required parameter without an embed option, the original received_body dictionary might be overwritten with a modified structure.
2. The condition for checking an empty string value for a form field with `Field` shape might not work as intended.
3. The logic for file upload handling and sequence checks seems complex and prone to errors.
4. Error handling for missing values or validation errors might not be correctly structured.

## Bug Explanation:
The bug in this function primarily arises from the incorrect handling of received body data for a single required parameter without an embed option. The original received_body dictionary might be updated in a way that's not expected by subsequent logic, leading to potential issues with validation and conversion for other fields.

## Strategy for Bug Fixing:
To fix the bug and improve the function overall:
1. Improve how the received body is modified for cases where there is a single required parameter without the embed option.
2. Simplify the logic for value retrieval and validation, especially for form fields and file uploads.
3. Ensure that error handling is consistent and correctly identifies missing or validation errors.

## Corrected Function:
```python
async def request_body_to_args(
    required_params: List[ModelField],
    received_body: Optional[Union[Dict[str, Any], FormData]],
) -> Tuple[Dict[str, Any], List[ErrorWrapper]]:
    values = {}
    errors = []
    if required_params:
        for field in required_params:
            value: Any = None
            if received_body is not None:
                if field.shape in sequence_shapes and isinstance(
                    received_body, FormData
                ):
                    value = received_body.getlist(field.alias)
                else:
                    value = received_body.get(field.alias)
            
            if value is None or (isinstance(field_info, params.Form) and value == ""):
                if field.required:
                    errors.append(
                        ErrorWrapper(MissingError(), loc=("body", field.alias))
                    )
                else:
                    values[field.name] = deepcopy(field.default)
                    continue
                
            if isinstance(field_info, params.File) and lenient_issubclass(field.type_, bytes) and isinstance(value, UploadFile):
                value = await value.read()
            elif field.shape in sequence_shapes and isinstance(field_info, params.File) and lenient_issubclass(field.type_, bytes) and isinstance(value, sequence_types):
                awaitables = [sub_value.read() for sub_value in value]
                contents = await asyncio.gather(*awaitables)
                value = sequence_shape_to_type[field.shape](contents)
                
            v_, errors_ = field.validate(value, values, loc=("body", field.alias))
            if isinstance(errors_, ErrorWrapper):
                errors.append(errors_)
            elif isinstance(errors_, list):
                errors.extend(errors_)
            else:
                values[field.name] = v_
    return values, errors
```

In the corrected version, the handling of received body data for single required parameters without an embed option is simplified and improved. The logic for value retrieval, validation, and error handling is made more concise and consistent. This should help mitigate the bug and improve the overall functionality of the function.
