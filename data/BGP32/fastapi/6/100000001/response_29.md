## Analysis:
1. The function `request_body_to_args` takes a list of required parameters and a received body as input.
2. It iterates over the required parameters and attempts to extract values from the received body based on the parameter information.
3. If a required parameter is missing or empty, it adds an error to the `errors` list.
4. It also handles special cases for file uploads and sequences of values.
5. The function returns a dictionary of extracted values and a list of errors encountered during the extraction process.
6. The bug may be related to how values are extracted from the received body and how errors are handled.

## Potential Errors:
1. Incorrect handling of the received body when `embed` is not present.
2. Checking the type of expected values against `sequence_shapes` may cause issues.
3. Error generation and handling logic might need improvement.
4. Pathway for handling file uploads and sequences could be prone to errors.

## Bug Explanation:
The bug could arise from how the function handles single required parameters with no `embed` attribute present. It assumes that the received body should be wrapped with the parameter's alias, which might not be correct. Additionally, the logic for extracting values from the body and generating errors might be faulty, leading to incorrect behavior.

## Suggested Strategy:
1. Improve the extraction of values from the received body based on the parameters' information.
2. Enhance the error generation and handling logic to properly indicate missing or incorrectly formatted parameters.
3. Review the special cases for file uploads and sequence shapes to ensure correct behavior.

## Corrected Version:
```python
async def request_body_to_args(
    required_params: List[ModelField],
    received_body: Optional[Union[Dict[str, Any], FormData]],
) -> Tuple[Dict[str, Any], List[ErrorWrapper]]:
    values = {}
    errors = []
    for field in required_params:
        value = None
        if received_body is not None:
            if field.shape in sequence_shapes and isinstance(received_body, FormData):
                value = received_body.getlist(field.alias)
            else:
                value = received_body.get(field.alias)
        if value is None or (field.required and value in ("", [])):
            if field.required:
                errors.append(
                    ErrorWrapper(MissingError(), loc=("body", field.alias))
                )
            else:
                values[field.name] = deepcopy(field.default)
            continue
        if isinstance(field_info, params.File) and lenient_issubclass(field.type_, bytes):
            if isinstance(value, list):
                value = [await file.read() for file in value]
            elif isinstance(value, UploadFile):
                value = await value.read()
        v, errors_ = field.validate(value, values, loc=("body", field.alias))
        if isinstance(errors_, ErrorWrapper):
            errors.append(errors_)
        elif isinstance(errors_, list):
            errors.extend(errors_)
        else:
            values[field.name] = v
    return values, errors
```

This revised version simplifies the logic for value extraction, improves error handling, and ensures correct handling of file uploads and sequences during parameter validation.
