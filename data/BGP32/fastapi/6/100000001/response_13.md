## Analysis:
1. The `request_body_to_args` function takes a list of required model fields and a received body (either a dict or FormData).
2. The function iterates through the required fields and processes their values from the received body.
3. It checks for missing values, handles file uploads, and validates the field values.
4. There are potential issues with how the `received_body` is processed and how errors are handled.


## Potential Error Locations:
1. Handling of `received_body` when there is only one required parameter.
2. Incorrect processing of field values based on shape and type.
3. Error handling when required fields are missing or have empty values.


## Bug Explanation:
1. When there is only one required parameter and it does not have the `embed` attribute set, the function wraps the received body within a dictionary with the field alias as the key. This behavior is not ideal as it doesn't account for multiple parameters not being embedded in separate dictionaries.
2. There may be issues with processing values based on shape and type, especially for file uploads.
3. Error handling for missing or empty required fields may not be working correctly.


## Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
1. Modify the logic for handling `received_body` when there is only one required parameter to handle multiple parameters correctly.
2. Ensure that values are processed correctly based on their shape and type, especially for file uploads.
3. Improve error handling to correctly identify missing or empty required fields.


## Corrected Version:
```python
async def request_body_to_args(
    required_params: List[ModelField],
    received_body: Optional[Union[Dict[str, Any], FormData]],
) -> Tuple[Dict[str, Any], List[ErrorWrapper]]:
    values = {}
    errors = []
    for field in required_params:
        value: Any = None
        if received_body is not None:
            if field.shape in sequence_shapes and isinstance(received_body, FormData):
                value = received_body.getlist(field.alias)
            else:
                value = received_body.get(field.alias)
        
        if value is None or (value == "" and field.required):
            errors.append(ErrorWrapper(MissingError(), loc=("body", field.alias)))
        else:
            if isinstance(field_info, params.File) and lenient_issubclass(field.type_, bytes) and isinstance(value, UploadFile):
                value = await value.read()
            elif field.shape in sequence_shapes and isinstance(field_info, params.File) and lenient_issubclass(field.type_, bytes) and isinstance(value, sequence_types):
                awaitables = [sub_value.read() for sub_value in value]
                contents = await asyncio.gather(*awaitables)
                value = sequence_shape_to_type[field.shape](contents)
            
            v_, errors_ = field.validate(value, values, loc=("body", field.alias))
            if isinstance(errors_, ErrorWrapper):
                errors.append(errors_)
            elif isinstance(errors_, list):
                errors.extend(errors_)
            else:
                values[field.name] = v_

    return values, errors
```

In the corrected version, the handling of `received_body` for single required parameters is removed to prevent wrapping them in dictionaries. The value processing logic is simplified and error handling for missing or empty required fields is improved.
