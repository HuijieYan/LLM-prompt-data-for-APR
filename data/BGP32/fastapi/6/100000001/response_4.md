## Analysis:
The buggy function `request_body_to_args` is designed to convert the received request body into arguments for endpoint functions. The function iterates over the required parameters and attempts to extract corresponding values from the received body. However, there are several potential error locations within the function that can lead to incorrect behavior or unexpected errors.

## Identified issues:
1. If `received_body` is a `FormData` instance and the field shape is within `sequence_shapes`, the function uses `getlist` to retrieve values. However, `getlist` may return multiple values as a list, which may not be handled properly.
2. The condition for checking if a field is missing, empty, or required is complex and may not cover all edge cases accurately.
3. The logic for handling file uploads and sequences of files may cause unexpected errors or incorrect data processing.

## Bug cause:
The main cause of the bug in the function is the improper handling of different types of fields and values, especially when dealing with file uploads, sequences, and missing/empty values. This leads to potential errors, missing data, or incorrect validation results.

## Suggested strategy for fixing the bug:
To fix the bug in the `request_body_to_args` function:
1. Improve the logic for extracting values from the received body based on field types and shapes.
2. Simplify the conditions for checking missing, empty, or required fields.
3. Ensure proper handling of file uploads and sequences, including reading file contents and validating data.

## Corrected version of the function:
```python
async def request_body_to_args(
    required_params: List[ModelField],
    received_body: Optional[Union[Dict[str, Any], FormData]],
) -> Tuple[Dict[str, Any], List[ErrorWrapper]]:
    values = {}
    errors = []
    for field in required_params:
        value = None
        if received_body is not None:
            if field.alias in received_body:
                value = received_body[field.alias]
            if value is None or isinstance(value, str) and not value:
                if field.required:
                    errors.append(ErrorWrapper(MissingError(), loc=("body", field.alias)))
                else:
                    values[field.name] = deepcopy(field.default)
                continue
            if isinstance(field_info, params.File) and lenient_issubclass(field.type_, bytes):
                if isinstance(value, UploadFile):
                    value = await value.read()
                elif isinstance(value, list) and all(isinstance(v, UploadFile) for v in value):
                    value = [await v.read() for v in value]
                else:
                    errors.append(ErrorWrapper(ValueError("Invalid file upload"), loc=("body", field.alias)))
                    continue
            v_, errors_ = field.validate(value, values, loc=("body", field.alias))
            if isinstance(errors_, ErrorWrapper):
                errors.append(errors_)
            elif isinstance(errors_, list):
                errors.extend(errors_)
            else:
                values[field.name] = v_
    return values, errors
```

In the corrected version, I simplified the logic for extracting values from the received body, improved the handling of required/missing/empty fields, and ensured proper processing of file uploads and sequences. This should address the identified issues and provide more reliable and accurate behavior for the function.
