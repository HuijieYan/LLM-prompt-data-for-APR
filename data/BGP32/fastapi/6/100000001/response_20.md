The buggy function `request_body_to_args` is designed to convert the received request body into arguments based on the required parameters specified. The function goes through each required parameter, extracts the corresponding value from the request body, validates it, and populates the `values` dictionary with the validated values while collecting any errors encountered during the process in the `errors` list.

### Identified potential error locations:
1. Incorrect handling of `sequence_shapes` and `sequence_types`.
2. Issue with the condition for checking if a value is required.
3. Misuse of `field_info` object in certain logic branches.
4. Potential inconsistency with the ErrorWrapper objects based on Pydantic version.

### Cause of the bug:
The bug in this function arises from the improper handling of `sequence_shapes` and `sequence_types` in the logic flow. Additionally, the condition for checking if a value is required is not correctly evaluated under certain circumstances. The `field_info` object is not used consistently within the function, potentially leading to erroneous behavior. Lastly, there might be an inconsistency in the handling of the `ErrorWrapper` objects based on the Pydantic version.

### Strategy for fixing the bug:
1. Ensure proper handling of `sequence_shapes` and `sequence_types` to correctly parse sequences.
2. Refactor the condition for checking if a value is required to correctly handle empty values.
3. Use `field_info` consistently throughout the function to avoid errors.
4. Address any discrepancies in the `ErrorWrapper` object instantiation based on the Pydantic version.

### Corrected version of the function:
```python
async def request_body_to_args(
    required_params: List[ModelField],
    received_body: Optional[Union[Dict[str, Any], FormData]],
) -> Tuple[Dict[str, Any], List[ErrorWrapper]]:
    values = {}
    errors = []
    sequence_shapes = {list, set, tuple}
    sequence_types = {list, set, tuple}
    sequence_shape_to_type = {list: List, set: set, tuple: Tuple}

    for field in required_params:
        field_info = get_field_info(field)
        value: Any = None
        if received_body is not None:
            if field.shape in sequence_shapes and isinstance(received_body, FormData):
                value = received_body.getlist(field.alias)
            else:
                value = received_body.get(field.alias)

        if (
            value is None
            or (field.required and value == "")
            or (field.shape in sequence_shapes and isinstance(value, sequence_types) and len(value) == 0)
        ):
            if field.required:
                errors.append(
                    ErrorWrapper(MissingError(), loc=("body", field.alias))
                )
            else:
                values[field.name] = deepcopy(field.default)
        else:
            if isinstance(field_info, params.File) and lenient_issubclass(field.type_, bytes) and isinstance(value, UploadFile):
                value = await value.read()
            elif field.shape in sequence_shapes and isinstance(field_info, params.File) and lenient_issubclass(field.type_, bytes) and isinstance(value, sequence_types):
                awaitables = [sub_value.read() for sub_value in value]
                contents = await asyncio.gather(*awaitables)
                value = sequence_shape_to_type[field.shape](contents)
            
            v_, errors_ = field.validate(value, values, loc=("body", field.alias))
            if isinstance(errors_, ErrorWrapper):
                errors.append(errors_)
            elif isinstance(errors_, list):
                errors.extend(errors_)
            else:
                values[field.name] = v_

    return values, errors
``` 

In the corrected version, the function iterates over each required parameter, resolves the value from the request body, validates it, and appends any errors encountered. Additionally, the handling of empty values and sequences has been improved to eliminate the bugs observed in the original implementation.
