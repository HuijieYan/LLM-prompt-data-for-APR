### Analysis:
The buggy function `request_body_to_args` is designed to convert a request body into arguments based on a list of required parameters. It iterates over the required parameters, extracts the corresponding values from the received body, validates them, and populates the `values` dictionary. Errors encountered during extraction or validation are accumulated in the `errors` list.

### Potential Error Locations:
1. Mismatch between `field_info` and `field`: The function uses `field_info` to retrieve information about a field, but it does not update `field_info` within the loop when iterating over required parameters.
2. Incorrect handling of sequences: The function checks if a field is a sequence and a file upload at the same time but may not handle this case correctly.
3. Validation and error processing: There might be inconsistencies in the error handling and validation logic.

### Cause of the Bug:
The bug in the provided function lies in the incorrect usage of `field_info` and its relationship with `field` within the loop. Since `field_info` is extracted outside the loop and not updated, it might lead to inconsistencies when processing different fields. This can result in errors not being handled correctly or values not being extracted accurately.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
1. Ensure that `field_info` is correctly associated with the current `field` being processed within the loop.
2. Review the conditional statements related to sequences and file uploads to handle these cases appropriately.
3. Validate extracted values against the corresponding fields accurately to prevent errors.

### Corrected Version:
```python
async def request_body_to_args(
    required_params: List[ModelField],
    received_body: Optional[Union[Dict[str, Any], FormData]],
) -> Tuple[Dict[str, Any], List[ErrorWrapper]]:
    values = {}
    errors = []
    for field in required_params:
        field_info = get_field_info(field)
        embed = getattr(field_info, "embed", None)
        if len(required_params) == 1 and not embed:
            received_body = {field.alias: received_body}
        value: Any = None
        if received_body is not None:
            if field.shape in sequence_shapes and isinstance(
                received_body, FormData
            ):
                value = received_body.getlist(field.alias)
            else:
                value = received_body.get(field.alias)
        if (
            value is None
            or (isinstance(field_info, params.Form) and value == "")
            or (
                isinstance(field_info, params.Form)
                and field.shape in sequence_shapes
                and len(value) == 0
            )
        ):
            if field.required:
                if PYDANTIC_1:
                    errors.append(
                        ErrorWrapper(MissingError(), loc=("body", field.alias))
                    )
                else:  # pragma: nocover
                    errors.append(
                        ErrorWrapper(  # type: ignore
                            MissingError(),
                            loc=("body", field.alias),
                            config=BaseConfig,
                        )
                    )
            else:
                values[field.name] = deepcopy(field.default)
            continue
        if (
            isinstance(field_info, params.File)
            and lenient_issubclass(field.type_, bytes)
            and isinstance(value, UploadFile)
        ):
            value = await value.read()
        elif (
            field.shape in sequence_shapes
            and isinstance(field_info, params.File)
            and lenient_issubclass(field.type_, bytes)
            and isinstance(value, sequence_types)
        ):
            awaitables = [sub_value.read() for sub_value in value]
            contents = await asyncio.gather(*awaitables)
            value = sequence_shape_to_type[field.shape](contents)
        v_, errors_ = field.validate(value, values, loc=("body", field.alias))
        if isinstance(errors_, ErrorWrapper):
            errors.append(errors_)
        elif isinstance(errors_, list):
            errors.extend(errors_)
        else:
            values[field.name] = v_
    return values, errors
```

In the corrected version, the function now correctly assigns `field_info` inside the loop for each field being processed. This ensures that the correct field information is used during extraction and validation. Additionally, the sequence and file handling logic remains unchanged unless there are specific issues identified during testing.
