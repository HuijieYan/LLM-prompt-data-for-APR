### Analysis:
1. The function `request_body_to_args` takes in a list of required parameters and a dictionary or FormData representing the received body data.
2. It iterates over the required parameters, tries to extract values from the received body data based on the field aliases, validates and processes the values accordingly.
3. The potential causes of bugs in this function could be related to:
   - Incorrectly handling the received body data.
   - Inconsistent use of field_info and field.
   - Errors in the validation and processing of values.
4. The bug might be related to incorrect handling of the received body data, missing validations, or inconsistent processing for different field types.

### Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug in the `request_body_to_args` function:
1. Ensure that the received_body is properly processed based on the field types.
2. Use the correct field_info and field objects consistently for validation and processing.
3. Handle validation errors appropriately and populate the values dictionary with valid values.
4. Ensure that the file upload data is correctly read and processed.

### Corrected Version:
```python
async def request_body_to_args(
    required_params: List[ModelField],
    received_body: Optional[Union[Dict[str, Any], FormData]],
) -> Tuple[Dict[str, Any], List[ErrorWrapper]]:
    values = {}
    errors = []
    for field in required_params:
        field_info = get_field_info(field)
        value = None
        if received_body is not None:
            if isinstance(received_body, FormData):
                alias = field.alias
                if field.alias in received_body and hasattr(field_info, "embed"):
                    value = received_body[field.alias]
            else:
                if field.alias in received_body:
                    value = received_body[field.alias]
        if value is None or (isinstance(field_info, params.Form) and value == ""):
            if field.required:
                errors.append(ErrorWrapper(MissingError(), loc=("body", field.alias)))
            else:
                values[field.name] = deepcopy(field.default)
        else:
            if isinstance(field_info, params.File) and lenient_issubclass(field.type_, bytes) and isinstance(value, UploadFile):
                value = await value.read()
            v_, errors_ = field.validate(value, values, loc=("body", field.alias))
            if isinstance(errors_, ErrorWrapper):
                errors.append(errors_)
            elif isinstance(errors_, list):
                errors.extend(errors_)
            else:
                values[field.name] = v_
    return values, errors
```

In this corrected version:
- The received_body data is properly checked and extracted based on the alias.
- The validation and processing of values are done consistently using the field object and field_info.
- Error handling for missing values and validation errors is improved.
- File upload data is correctly processed before validation.

Make sure to test this corrected version with different scenarios to validate its functionality and correctness.
