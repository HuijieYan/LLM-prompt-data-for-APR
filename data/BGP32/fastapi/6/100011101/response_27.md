## Bug Explanation
The bug in the `request_body_to_args` function is related to handling sequence data types when received as form data (FormData). The function fails to correctly process lists, sets, and tuples present in the form data, leading to validation errors.

In the failing test cases, the function does not correctly handle the conversion of sequence data types from form data to the expected type (list, set, tuple). This results in validation errors indicating that the expected status code of 200 is not met.

The error occurs because the function incorrectly processes the received form data by assuming that the value associated with the field alias is always a single value. It does not properly handle multiple values associated with the same field alias in the form data.

## Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug in the `request_body_to_args` function, we need to update the logic for processing sequences (lists, sets, tuples) in the received form data (FormData). Specifically, we should handle cases where a field alias in the form data corresponds to multiple values, indicating a sequence data type.

To address the bug, we should update the logic to properly extract sequence data from the form data by identifying multiple values associated with the same field alias. Then, we need to convert these multiple values into the expected sequence type (list, set, tuple) before validating and assigning the values to the output dictionary.

## Corrected Version of the Function
Here is the corrected version of the `request_body_to_args` function:

```python
async def request_body_to_args(
    required_params: List[ModelField],
    received_body: Optional[Union[Dict[str, Any], FormData]],
) -> Tuple[Dict[str, Any], List[ErrorWrapper]]:
    values = {}
    errors = []
    
    for field in required_params:
        if received_body:
            # Extract values associated with the field alias
            if isinstance(received_body, FormData):
                values_list = received_body.getlist(field.alias)
            else:
                values_list = [received_body.get(field.alias)]
            
            if field.shape in sequence_shapes:
                # Convert the values list to the appropriate sequence type
                if field.type_ == list:
                    value = values_list
                elif field.type_ == set:
                    value = set(values_list)
                elif field.type_ == tuple:
                    value = tuple(values_list)
            else:
                value = values_list[0] if values_list else None
            
            if value is None or (isinstance(field_info, params.Form) and value == ""):
                if field.required:
                    errors.append(ErrorWrapper(MissingError(), loc=("body", field.alias)))
                else:
                    values[field.name] = deepcopy(field.default)
            else:
                if isinstance(field_info, params.File) and lenient_issubclass(field.type_, bytes):
                    if isinstance(value, UploadFile):
                        value = await value.read()
                    else:
                        awaitables = [sub_value.read() for sub_value in value]
                        contents = await asyncio.gather(*awaitables)
                        value = sequence_shape_to_type[field.shape](contents)

                v_, errors_ = field.validate(value, values, loc=("body", field.alias))
                if isinstance(errors_, ErrorWrapper):
                    errors.append(errors_)
                elif isinstance(errors_, list):
                    errors.extend(errors_)
                else:
                    values[field.name] = v_

    return values, errors
```

This corrected version of the `request_body_to_args` function properly handles the extraction and conversion of sequence data from the received form data, ensuring that lists, sets, and tuples are correctly processed and validated.
