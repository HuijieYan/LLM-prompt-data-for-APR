## Bug Explanation
The bug in the `request_body_to_args` function is that it does not properly handle the conversion of form data for different types of sequences like lists, sets, and tuples. This leads to validation errors and the function not populating the values correctly.

The function incorrectly treats all types of sequences the same way when extracting values from FormData. This causes issues when trying to validate and process the received data. The function does not handle nested sequences or type-specific conversions properly.

## Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to modify how the function extracts and processes values from the FormData for different types of sequences. We also need to ensure that the values are correctly validated and inserted into the final dictionary according to the respective sequence type.

## The Corrected Function
```python
async def request_body_to_args(
    required_params: List[ModelField],
    received_body: Optional[Union[Dict[str, Any], FormData]],
) -> Tuple[Dict[str, Any], List[ErrorWrapper]]:
    values = {}
    errors = []
    if required_params and received_body is not None:
        for field in required_params:
            field_info = get_field_info(field)
            embed = getattr(field_info, "embed", None)
            field_alias = field.alias
            if lenient_issubclass(field.type_, list):
                values[field.name] = received_body.getlist(field_alias)
            elif lenient_issubclass(field.type_, set):
                values[field.name] = set(received_body.getlist(field_alias))
            elif lenient_issubclass(field.type_, tuple):
                values[field.name] = tuple(received_body.getlist(field_alias))

            v_, errors_ = field.validate(
                values[field.name], values, loc=("body", field_alias)
            )

            if isinstance(errors_, ErrorWrapper):
                errors.append(errors_)
            elif isinstance(errors_, list):
                errors.extend(errors_)

    return values, errors
```

This corrected version of the function properly handles extracting, casting, and validating values from form data for lists, sets, and tuples. It distinguishes between different sequence types and inserts the correctly processed values into the final dictionary. This should resolve the issues and make the function work as intended for the given test cases.
