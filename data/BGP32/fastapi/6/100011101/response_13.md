## Bug Explanation
The buggy function `request_body_to_args` is responsible for converting the received body data into arguments based on the required parameters. The bug is causing the function to generate validation errors erroneously, which leads to the tests failing with a `422` status code instead of the expected `200` status code.

The bug occurs when handling sequence types (list, set, tuple) that are passed as form data. The function is not correctly extracting these sequence values from the form data and processing them into the expected types (`list`, `set`, `tuple`). As a result, validation errors are being triggered due to incorrect processing of these values.

## Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the function correctly processes sequence data (list, set, tuple) from the received form data. We should extract these values appropriately and convert them to the expected sequence types before validation. By handling sequence data correctly, we can avoid triggering unnecessary validation errors and ensure that the function outputs the expected arguments and errors.

## The Corrected Version of the Function
```python
async def request_body_to_args(
    required_params: List[ModelField],
    received_body: Optional[Union[Dict[str, Any], FormData]],
) -> Tuple[Dict[str, Any], List[ErrorWrapper]]:
    values = {}
    errors = []

    for field in required_params:
        value: Any = None
        if received_body is not None:
            if field.shape in sequence_shapes and isinstance(received_body, FormData):
                value = received_body.getlist(field.alias)
            else:
                value = received_body.get(field.alias)
                
            if value is None:
                value = field.default
            
        v_, errors_ = field.validate(value, values, loc=("body", field.alias))
        if isinstance(errors_, ErrorWrapper):
            errors.append(errors_)
        elif isinstance(errors_, list):
            errors.extend(errors_)
        else:
            values[field.name] = v_

    return values, errors
```

By updating the function as outlined above, we ensure that sequence data provided as form inputs is correctly processed and converted to the expected formats (`list`, `set`, `tuple`) before validation. This correction should resolve the bug and make the function output the expected arguments and errors, passing the failing tests with the correct `200` status code.
