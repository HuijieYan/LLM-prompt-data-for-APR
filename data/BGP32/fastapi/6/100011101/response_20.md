The bug in the `request_body_to_args` function lies in the way it handles verifying and extracting values from different data structures like lists, sets, and tuples in the `received_body`. Specifically, it fails to properly handle these non-typing sequences, leading to validation errors and incorrect values in the output dictionary.

The issue arises because the `field.shape` attribute is not being handled correctly, and the function does not differentiate between sequences and non-sequences properly.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the way the function processes the `received_body`, especially when dealing with non-typing sequences like lists, sets, and tuples. We need to consider the `field.shape` and update the logic to extract the values accordingly.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
async def request_body_to_args(
    required_params: List[ModelField],
    received_body: Optional[Union[Dict[str, Any], FormData]],
) -> Tuple[Dict[str, Any], List[ErrorWrapper]]:
    values = {}
    errors = []
    
    for field in required_params:
        value: Any = None
        if received_body is not None:
            if isinstance(received_body, FormData):
                # Extract value based on field type and shape
                if field.shape in (1, 2):
                    value = received_body.getlist(field.alias)
                else:
                    value = received_body.get(field.alias)
        
        if value is None or value == "":
            # If the value is missing or empty, handle based on field properties
            if field.required:
                errors.append(ErrorWrapper(MissingError(), loc=("body", field.alias)))
            elif getattr(field, "default", None) is not None:
                values[field.name] = deepcopy(field.default)
        else:
            # Perform necessary value transformations
            if field.shape == 1:
                v_, errors_ = field.validate(value, values, loc=("body", field.alias))
            elif field.shape == 2:
                value = set(value)
                v_, errors_ = field.validate(value, values, loc=("body", field.alias))
            elif field.shape == 3:
                value = tuple(value)                     
                v_, errors_ = field.validate(value, values, loc=("body", field.alias))
            errors_ = errors_ if isinstance(errors_, list) else [errors_]
            errors.extend(errors_)
            values[field.name] = v_

    return values, errors
```

By updating the logic to handle different `field.shape` values corresponding to lists, sets, and tuples appropriately, this corrected version of the function should now pass the failing tests and properly extract values from the `received_body` for non-typing sequences.
