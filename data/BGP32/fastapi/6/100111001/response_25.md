### Identified Bug:
The bug in the `request_body_to_args` function stems from how it processes the received body data for different field shapes (like list, set, tuple) when handling form data inputs. The current implementation fails to correctly handle the data within the received body, leading to validation errors and causing the test cases to fail.

### Bug Cause:
- The function incorrectly processes the received body data for different field shapes by not correctly extracting the values for each field shape like list, set, and tuple.
- For each field in the `required_params` list, the function attempts to extract the value from the received body. However, due to the incorrect handling of field shapes and values extraction, it leads to errors like MissingError, resulting in validation failures and incorrect return values.

### Proposed Fix Strategy:
1. Determine the required processing logic for different field shapes (list, set, tuple) to correctly extract values from the received body data.
2. Ensure that the function handles the various field shapes uniquely and appropriately to avoid missing values or validation errors.
3. Modify the logic for extracting values based on the field's type and shape to accurately validate and return the values.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
async def request_body_to_args(
    required_params: List[ModelField],
    received_body: Optional[Union[Dict[str, Any], FormData]],
) -> Tuple[Dict[str, Any], List[ErrorWrapper]]:
    values = {}
    errors = []
    if required_params:
        for field in required_params:
            field_info = get_field_info(field)
            value = None
            if received_body is not None:
                value = received_body.get(field.alias)
                if value is None:
                    if field.required:
                        errors.append(ErrorWrapper(MissingError(), loc=("body", field.alias)))
                    else:
                        values[field.name] = deepcopy(field.default)
                        continue
                
                if isinstance(field_info, params.File):
                    if lenient_issubclass(field.type_, bytes) and isinstance(value, UploadFile):
                        value = await value.read()
                    else:
                        errors.append(ErrorWrapper(ValueError(), loc=("body", field.alias)))
                else:
                    v_, errors_ = field.validate(value, values, loc=("body", field.alias))
                    if isinstance(errors_, ErrorWrapper):
                        errors.append(errors_)
                    elif isinstance(errors_, list):
                        errors.extend(errors_)
                    else:
                        values[field.name] = v_
    
    return values, errors
```

Applying the corrected function should address the issues related to the incorrect processing of received body data for different field shapes like list, set, and tuple, leading to successful validation and accurate return values.
