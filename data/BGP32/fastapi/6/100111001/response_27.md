### Bug Explanation
The buggy function `request_body_to_args` is not correctly handling input data when a field is in the form of a list, set, or tuple. The function mistakenly treats the input data as a single value rather than a sequence of values, causing it to produce validation errors and return a status code of 422 instead of 200 in the test cases.

The key issue arises from the way the function processes the received body data for each field. It fails to handle sequence shapes correctly and does not unpack the values from the received FormData object. This leads to validation errors being generated even though the input data is valid.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the function correctly handles sequence shapes (list, set, tuple) in the input data. This involves checking the type of field and dealing with sequence shapes appropriately to process the data correctly. Additionally, values from FormData need to be unpacked and validated correctly based on the field requirements.

### Corrected Version
Here is the corrected version of the `request_body_to_args` function:

```python
async def request_body_to_args(
    required_params: List[ModelField],
    received_body: Optional[Union[Dict[str, Any], FormData]],
) -> Tuple[Dict[str, Any], List[ErrorWrapper]]:
    values = {}
    errors = []
    for field in required_params:
        value = None
        if received_body is not None:
            if field.shape in sequence_shapes and isinstance(received_body, FormData):
                value = received_body.getlist(field.alias)
            else:
                value = received_body.get(field.alias, None)
        
        if value is None or (isinstance(field_info, params.Form) and value == ""):
            if field.required:
                errors.append(ErrorWrapper(MissingError(), loc=("body", field.alias)))
            else:
                values[field.name] = deepcopy(field.default)
            continue

        if isinstance(field_info, params.File) and lenient_issubclass(field.type_, bytes) and isinstance(value, UploadFile):
            value = await value.read()
        
        v_, errors_ = field.validate(value, values, loc=("body", field.alias))
        if isinstance(errors_, ErrorWrapper):
            errors.append(errors_)
        elif isinstance(errors_, list):
            errors.extend(errors_)
        else:
            values[field.name] = v_
    
    return values, errors
```

In this corrected version, the function now correctly handles list, set, and tuple fields by unpacking values when necessary and validating them according to the field requirements. This fixes the issue of validation errors and ensures that the function returns the correct status code.
