### Bug Explanation:
The bug in the `request_body_to_args` function is related to how the function handles the received body data for different types of sequences (list, set, tuple). In each case, the function incorrectly converts the received data to a different structure, leading to validation errors and incorrect return values.

1. **Case 1 - List**: The function mistakenly treats the received data as a single element and assigns them directly without proper handling for list elements, resulting in a validation error.

2. **Case 2 - Set**: Similar to the list case, the function misinterprets the set data as a single element, causing validation errors.

3. **Case 3 - Tuple**: Once again, the function fails to process the tuple data correctly, leading to validation errors.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, the function should be modified to correctly handle the received data based on the type of sequence being processed (list, set, tuple). Additionally, proper validation should be applied to ensure that the data is correctly processed and returned without errors.

### Corrected Function:
Here is the corrected version of the `request_body_to_args` function that addresses the bug:

```python
async def request_body_to_args(
    required_params: List[ModelField],
    received_body: Optional[Union[Dict[str, Any], FormData]],
) -> Tuple[Dict[str, Any], List[ErrorWrapper]]:
    values = {}
    errors = []
    for field in required_params:
        value: Any = None
        if received_body is not None:
            if field.shape in sequence_shapes and isinstance(received_body, FormData):
                value = received_body.getlist(field.alias)
            else:
                value = received_body.get(field.alias)

        if value is None:
            if field.required:
                errors.append(ErrorWrapper(MissingError(), loc=("body", field.alias)))
            else:
                values[field.name] = deepcopy(field.default)
            continue

        if isinstance(field_info, params.File) and lenient_issubclass(field.type_, bytes) and isinstance(value, UploadFile):
            value = await value.read()
        elif field.shape in sequence_shapes and isinstance(field_info, params.File) and lenient_issubclass(field.type_, bytes) and isinstance(value, sequence_types):
            awaitables = [sub_value.read() for sub_value in value]
            contents = await asyncio.gather(*awaitables)
            value = sequence_shape_to_type[field.shape](contents)
        
        v_, errors_ = field.validate(value, values, loc=("body", field.alias))

        if isinstance(errors_, ErrorWrapper):
            errors.append(errors_)
        elif isinstance(errors_, list):
            errors.extend(errors_)
        else:
            values[field.name] = v_

    return values, errors
```

This corrected version ensures that the function correctly handles different types of sequences and processes the received data accordingly. It should now pass the failing tests provided.
