### Bug Analysis and Explanation
In the provided buggy function `request_body_to_args`, there seems to be an issue with handling input parameters when dealing with non-typing sequences like lists, sets, and tuples. The function is not unpacking these sequences correctly from the received body, leading to validation errors and incorrect return values.

The issue arises from how the function processes received body data for non-typing sequences. It fails to properly handle these sequences, resulting in errors during validation and causing the failing tests to receive a response status code of 422 instead of the expected 200.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug in the `request_body_to_args` function, we need to correctly handle non-typing sequences like lists, sets, and tuples from the received body data. This involves unpacking the elements of these sequences appropriately to ensure accurate validation and return values.

### Corrected Function
Here is a corrected version of the `request_body_to_args` function:

```python
async def request_body_to_args(
    required_params: List[ModelField],
    received_body: Optional[Union[Dict[str, Any], FormData]],
) -> Tuple[Dict[str, Any], List[ErrorWrapper]]:
    values = {}
    errors = []
    
    for field in required_params:
        value: Any = None
        if received_body is not None:
            value = received_body.get(field.alias)
            if value is None and field.required:
                errors.append(ErrorWrapper(MissingError(), loc=("body", field.alias)))
            else:
                try:
                    v_, errors_ = field.validate(value, values, loc=("body", field.alias))
                    if isinstance(errors_, ErrorWrapper):
                        errors.append(errors_)
                    elif isinstance(errors_, list):
                        errors.extend(errors_)
                    else:
                        values[field.name] = v_
                except Exception as e:
                    errors.append(ErrorWrapper(e, loc=("body", field.alias)))

    return values, errors
```

This corrected version should handle non-typing sequences correctly, ensuring that the validation process works as expected and the failing tests pass with the correct response status code of 200.
