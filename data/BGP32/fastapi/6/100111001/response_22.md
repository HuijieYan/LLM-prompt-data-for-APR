### Explanation:
The buggy function `request_body_to_args` is designed to convert the received request body into arguments for a FastAPI endpoint. However, there are several issues in the function that cause it to fail when dealing with non-typing sequences like lists, sets, and tuples.

1. The function incorrectly handles non-typing sequences by attempting to get a single value from the received body instead of extracting the sequence as expected.
2. The function does not account for the different behaviors needed for lists, sets, and tuples in the validation process, leading to validation errors and incorrect values in `errors`.
3. The function does not properly handle non-typing sequences when defining the value for a field in `values`.

The failing tests highlight the issues in handling python sequences as form data, resulting in unexpected errors and incorrect status codes.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
1. Detect and distinguish between different non-typing sequence types.
2. Appropriately extract and processes values from non-typing sequences.
3. Adjust validation logic based on the type of non-typing sequence encountered.
4. Correctly set the values in `values` for non-typing sequences.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
async def request_body_to_args(
    required_params: List[ModelField],
    received_body: Optional[Union[Dict[str, Any], FormData]],
) -> Tuple[Dict[str, Any], List[ErrorWrapper]]:
    values = {}
    errors = []
    
    if required_params:
        for field in required_params:
            if received_body is not None:
                if field.shape in sequence_shapes and isinstance(received_body, FormData):
                    if field.shape == 0:  # For set
                        value = set(received_body.getlist(field.alias))
                    else:  # For list or tuple
                        value = received_body.getlist(field.alias)
                else:
                    value = received_body.get(field.alias)
                
                if value is None or value == "" or len(value) == 0:
                    if field.required:
                        errors.append(ErrorWrapper(MissingError(), loc=("body", field.alias)))
                    else:
                        values[field.name] = deepcopy(field.default)
                    continue
                
                if isinstance(field_info, params.File) and lenient_issubclass(field.type_, bytes) and isinstance(value, UploadFile):
                    value = await value.read()
                
                v_, errors_ = field.validate(value, values, loc=("body", field.alias))
                
                if isinstance(errors_, ErrorWrapper):
                    errors.append(errors_)
                elif isinstance(errors_, list):
                    errors.extend(errors_)
                else:
                    values[field.name] = v_
       
    return values, errors
```

By updating the logic to handle non-typing sequences properly and adjusting the validation process based on the sequence type, the corrected version of the function should successfully process form data for lists, sets, and tuples and pass the failing tests.
