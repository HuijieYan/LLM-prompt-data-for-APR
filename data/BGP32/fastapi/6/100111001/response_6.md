### Bug Explanation:
The bug in the `request_body_to_args` function stems from the way it handles different types of sequences (list, set, tuple) as form data. The function incorrectly processes the received form data assuming it always contains multiple values for a single key, leading to errors in validation and incorrect values being assigned.

1. In Case 1, the function is treating the form data as if it contains multiple values for the 'items' key, resulting in the error due to incorrect handling of lists.
2. In Case 2, the function incorrectly processes a set in a similar manner to a list, causing validation errors for sets.
3. In Case 3, the same issue occurs with tuples, leading to handling errors and incorrect values.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug in the `request_body_to_args` function, we need to adjust how the function handles different sequence shapes (list, set, tuple) in the received form data. We should differentiate between single values and multiple values per key.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
async def request_body_to_args(
    required_params: List[ModelField],
    received_body: Optional[Union[Dict[str, Any], FormData]],
) -> Tuple[Dict[str, Any], List[ErrorWrapper]]:
    values = {}
    errors = []
    if required_params:
        for field in required_params:
            value: Any = None
            if received_body is not None:
                value = received_body.get(field.alias)
                if value is None or (isinstance(field_info, params.Form) and value == ""):
                    if field.required:
                        errors.append(ErrorWrapper(MissingError(), loc=("body", field.alias)))
                    else:
                        values[field.name] = deepcopy(field.default)
                    continue
                if isinstance(field_info, (params.File, ModelField)) and lenient_issubclass(field.type_, bytes):
                    if isinstance(value, UploadFile):
                        value = await value.read()  # Read bytes from the UploadFile
                    elif isinstance(value, sequence_types) and len(value) > 0 and isinstance(value[0], UploadFile):
                        files = await asyncio.gather(*[file.read() for file in value])
                        value = sequence_shape_to_type[field.shape](files)  # Convert files to applicable sequence type
                v_, errors_ = field.validate(value, values, loc=("body", field.alias))
                if isinstance(errors_, ErrorWrapper):
                    errors.append(errors_)
                elif isinstance(errors_, list):
                    errors.extend(errors_)
                else:
                    values[field.name] = v_
    return values, errors
```

By updating the logic to handle sequences correctly and validating the received data for each field individually, the corrected function should now properly process form data with different sequence shapes and reduce errors during validation, fixing the buggy behavior.
