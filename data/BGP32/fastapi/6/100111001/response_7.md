### Analysis:
1. The function `request_body_to_args` is responsible for converting received request body data into arguments based on the required parameters.
2. The function iterates through the required parameters and attempts to retrieve values from the received body.
3. The bug seems to be related to the handling of sequence types such as lists, sets, and tuples in the received form data, leading to validation errors for the fields.
4. The error messages from the failing tests indicate that the response status code is 422 (unprocessable entity) instead of the expected 200, which suggests that the function is failing to process the form data correctly.

### Bug Cause:
1. The function fails to handle sequence shapes correctly when extracting values from FormData in the case of lists, sets, and tuples. This leads to validation errors and incorrect handling of the required parameters.
2. The logic to process sequence shapes within the FormData seems to be incomplete or faulty, causing the function to accumulate errors and fail to return the expected values.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Update the logic in the function to properly handle sequence shapes within the received FormData for list, set, and tuple types.
2. Ensure that the values extracted from FormData for different field shapes are handled appropriately based on the expected type for the field.
3. Correctly validate the extracted values and handle errors accordingly to prevent the accumulation of errors and ensure successful processing of the required parameters.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
async def request_body_to_args(
    required_params: List[ModelField],
    received_body: Optional[Union[Dict[str, Any], FormData]],
) -> Tuple[Dict[str, Any], List[ErrorWrapper]]:
    values = {}
    errors = []
    for field in required_params:
        value = None
        if received_body is not None:
            field_info = get_field_info(field)
            value = received_body.get(field.alias)
            if value is None:
                if field.required:
                    errors.append(ErrorWrapper(MissingError(), loc=("body", field.alias)))
                else:
                    values[field.name] = deepcopy(field.default)
            else:
                try:
                    v, err = field.validate(value, values, loc=("body", field.alias))
                    if isinstance(err, ErrorWrapper):
                        errors.append(err)
                    else:
                        values[field.name] = v
                except ValueError as exc:
                    errors.append(ErrorWrapper(exc, loc=("body", field.alias)))
    return values, errors
```

### Changes in the Corrected Version:
1. Removed unnecessary logic that incorrectly handled sequence shapes.
2. Updated the iteration logic to process each required parameter individually.
3. Extracted the value directly from the FormData based on the field alias.
4. Properly validated the extracted value and handled errors more accurately.
5. Removed redundant checks and corrected the validation process for each field. 

After making these corrections, the function should properly handle the extraction and validation of values from the FormData for different field types, ensuring the successful processing of the required parameters.
