### Analysis:
1. The function `request_body_to_args` is intended to convert received body data into arguments based on required parameters.
2. The function iterates over required parameters, retrieves the corresponding values from the received body, validates them, and populates the `values` dictionary while collecting any potential errors.
3. The function is failing to correctly parse the received body data for non-list typed parameters such as sets and tuples.
4. The failing test cases are based on sending data in a list format, expecting conversion to sets or tuples.
5. The function currently does not handle this conversion correctly, leading to validation errors and incorrect output.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is caused by the function assuming a list structure for all sequence-shaped fields in the received body, leading to improper handling of set and tuple types. This results in validation errors and incorrect output for non-list parameters.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Update the function logic to correctly handle different sequence-shaped field types like sets and tuples.
2. Determine the type of field and handle the data extraction and validation accordingly to ensure correct conversion.
3. Adjust the logic for validating the values based on the field's shape and type to prevent validation errors for non-list sequence types.

### Corrected Version:
```python
async def request_body_to_args(
    required_params: List[ModelField],
    received_body: Optional[Union[Dict[str, Any], FormData]],
) -> Tuple[Dict[str, Any], List[ErrorWrapper]]:
    values = {}
    errors = []
    
    for field in required_params:
        value: Any = None
        
        if received_body is not None:
            if field.shape in sequence_shapes and isinstance(
                received_body, FormData
            ):
                value = received_body.getlist(field.alias)
            else:
                value = received_body.get(field.alias)
        
        if (
            value is None
            or (isinstance(field_info, params.Form) and value == "")
            or (
                isinstance(field_info, params.Form)
                and field.shape in sequence_shapes
                and len(value) == 0
            )
        ):
            if field.required:
                errors.append(
                    ErrorWrapper(MissingError(), loc=("body", field.alias))
                )
            else:
                values[field.name] = deepcopy(field.default)
            continue
        
        # Read file data if applicable
        if (
            isinstance(field_info, params.File)
            and lenient_issubclass(field.type_, bytes)
            and isinstance(value, UploadFile)
        ):
            value = await value.read()
        elif (
            field.shape in sequence_shapes
            and isinstance(field_info, params.File)
            and lenient_issubclass(field.type_, bytes)
            and isinstance(value, sequence_types)
        ):
            awaitables = [sub_value.read() for sub_value in value]
            contents = await asyncio.gather(*awaitables)
            value = sequence_shape_to_type[field.shape](contents)
        
        v_, errors_ = field.validate(value, values, loc=("body", field.alias))
        
        if isinstance(errors_, ErrorWrapper):
            errors.append(errors_)
        elif isinstance(errors_, list):
            errors.extend(errors_)
        else:
            values[field.name] = v_
    
    return values, errors
```

The corrected version of the function should now properly handle non-list sequence-shaped fields like sets and tuples, ensuring correct conversion and validation of the received body data.
