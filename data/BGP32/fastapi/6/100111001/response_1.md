### Bug Analysis:
The buggy function `request_body_to_args` is responsible for extracting values from the received body based on the required parameters and validating them. The bug seems to stem from how the function is handling sequences like lists, sets, and tuples in the `received_body`. It fails to correctly parse and validate these sequences, resulting in errors being added to the `errors` list and causing the failing tests.

### Bug Explanation:
The function fails because it doesn't properly handle sequence values (like lists, sets, and tuples) in the `received_body`. When trying to extract values for these sequences, the function encounters issues in parsing, reading, and validating them. This leads to incorrect validations and the addition of errors to the `errors` list, causing the tests to fail with a 422 status code instead of the expected 200.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to revise the logic for handling sequence values in the `received_body`. We should ensure that the values are correctly parsed, extracted, converted if needed, and validated according to the sequence data type specified in the `required_params`. By refining this process, we can prevent unnecessary errors and ensure the correct values are returned for sequences in the `received_body`.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
Here is the corrected version of the `request_body_to_args` function:
```python
async def request_body_to_args(
    required_params: List[ModelField],
    received_body: Optional[Union[Dict[str, Any], FormData]],
) -> Tuple[Dict[str, Any], List[ErrorWrapper]]:
    values = {}
    errors = []
    for field in required_params:
        value: Any = None
        if received_body is not None:
            if field.shape in sequence_shapes and isinstance(received_body, FormData):
                value = received_body.getlist(field.alias)
            else:
                value = received_body.get(field.alias)
        if value is None or (isinstance(field_info, params.Form) and value == ""):
            if field.required:
                errors.append(
                    ErrorWrapper(MissingError(), loc=("body", field.alias))
                )
            else:
                values[field.name] = deepcopy(field.default)
            continue
        v_, errors_ = field.validate(value, values, loc=("body", field.alias))
        if isinstance(errors_, ErrorWrapper):
            errors.append(errors_)
        elif isinstance(errors_, list):
            errors.extend(errors_)
        else:
            values[field.name] = v_
    return values, errors
```

By revising the sequence handling logic and ensuring proper extraction and validation for sequence values, the corrected version of the function should now pass the failing tests and return the expected status code of 200.
