### Bug Explanation:

The buggy function `request_body_to_args` is intended to convert request body parameters into arguments for a function. However, it fails to handle cases where the expected parameter type is a collection (list, set, tuple).

For the failing tests provided:
1. In Case 1, the test expects a Python list as a parameter, but the function incorrectly processes the FormData for a list, resulting in a 422 status code due to validation errors.
2. In Case 2, the test expects a Python set as a parameter, but the function also struggles with proper handling, resulting in the same validation errors and status code.
3. In Case 3, the test expects a Python tuple as a parameter, facing the same issue with handling FormData for a tuple, leading to validation errors and status code variations.

### Bug Fix Strategy:

To fix this bug, the function should be modified to correctly handle different shapes of input parameters, including lists, sets, and tuples. Specifically, it needs to distinguish between single elements and collections of elements in the request body data to parse them correctly.

### Corrected Version of the Function:

```python
async def request_body_to_args(
    required_params: List[ModelField],
    received_body: Optional[Union[Dict[str, Any], FormData]],
) -> Tuple[Dict[str, Any], List[ErrorWrapper]]:
    values = {}
    errors = []
    sequence_shape_to_type = {
        1: list,
        2: set,
        3: tuple
    }
    if required_params:
        this_field = required_params[0]
        field_info = get_field_info(this_field)
        embed = getattr(field_info, "embed", None)
        if len(required_params) == 1 and not embed:
            received_body = {this_field.alias: received_body}
        
        for field in required_params:
            value: Any = None
            if received_body is not None:
                if field.shape in sequence_shape_to_type and isinstance(
                    received_body, FormData
                ):
                    if field.shape == 1:  # list
                        value = received_body.getlist(field.alias)
                    elif field.shape == 2:  # set
                        value = set(received_body.getlist(field.alias))
                    elif field.shape == 3:  # tuple
                        value = tuple(received_body.getlist(field.alias))

                else:
                    value = received_body.get(field.alias)
            
            if (
                value is None
                or (isinstance(field_info, params.Form) and value == "")
                or (
                    isinstance(field_info, params.Form)
                    and field.shape in sequence_shape_to_type
                    and len(value) == 0
                )
            ):
                if field.required:
                    errors.append(
                        ErrorWrapper(MissingError(), loc=("body", field.alias))
                    )
                else:
                    values[field.name] = deepcopy(field.default)
                continue
            
            v_, errors_ = field.validate(value, values, loc=("body", field.alias))
            
            if isinstance(errors_, ErrorWrapper):
                errors.append(errors_)
            elif isinstance(errors_, list):
                errors.extend(errors_)
            else:
                values[field.name] = v_

    return values, errors
```

By incorporating a dictionary `sequence_shape_to_type` to map the different sequence shapes to their respective Python types and adjusting the handling of sequence types in the function, the corrected version should now be able to process list, set, and tuple parameters correctly from the request body.
