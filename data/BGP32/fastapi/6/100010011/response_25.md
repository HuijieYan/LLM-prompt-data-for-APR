### Analysis:
The buggy function `request_body_to_args` is responsible for extracting values from request body data and validating them against the required parameters. The function handles scenarios where the received body is a dictionary or `FormData`. The bug seems to be related to how the function processes values, especially for repeated keys within the request form data, leading to validation errors (`422`) instead of expected success (`200`).

### Potential Error Locations:
1. Handling of repeated keys in form data.
2. Incorrect processing of form data values.
3. Validation logic for form data fields.

### Cause of the Bug:
The bug is likely caused by the mishandling of repeated keys in form data. The function is currently assigning only the last value of repeated keys, which results in incomplete validation and leads to 422 errors. This behavior does not align with the expectations of users who want to collect all values associated with repeated keys into a list.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, the function needs to be modified to correctly process repeated keys in form data by collecting all associated values into a list. This will ensure that all values are considered during validation, and the function should return a status code of `200` when validations pass successfully.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
async def request_body_to_args(
    required_params: List[ModelField],
    received_body: Optional[Union[Dict[str, Any], FormData]],
) -> Tuple[Dict[str, Any], List[ErrorWrapper]]:
    values = {}
    errors = []
    if required_params:
        for field in required_params:
            value: Any = None
            if received_body is not None:
                if field.shape in sequence_shapes and isinstance(received_body, FormData):
                    if field.alias in received_body:
                        if field.shape in sequence_shapes:
                            value = received_body.getlist(field.alias)
                        else:
                            value = received_body[field.alias]
            if (
                value is None
                or (isinstance(field_info, params.Form) and value == "")
                or (
                    isinstance(field_info, params.Form)
                    and field.shape in sequence_shapes
                    and len(value) == 0
                )
            ):
                if field.required:
                    if PYDANTIC_1:
                        errors.append(
                            ErrorWrapper(MissingError(), loc=("body", field.alias))
                        )
                    else:
                        errors.append(
                            ErrorWrapper(MissingError(), loc=("body", field.alias), config=BaseConfig)
                        )
                else:
                    values[field.name] = deepcopy(field.default)
                continue
            # Handle processing for file types or sequence types if needed
            v_, errors_ = field.validate(value, values, loc=("body", field.alias))
            if isinstance(errors_, ErrorWrapper):
                errors.append(errors_)
            elif isinstance(errors_, list):
                errors.extend(errors_)
            else:
                values[field.name] = v_
    return values, errors
```

In the corrected version, the function now properly handles repeated keys in form data by collecting all associated values into a list based on the field alias. This modification ensures that all values are considered during validation, aligning with the expectations of the users and resolving the validation error issues.
