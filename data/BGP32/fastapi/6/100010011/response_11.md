## Analysis
The buggy function `request_body_to_args` is responsible for converting the received body data into arguments for FastAPI route functions. The function is encountering issues when handling multiple values for the same key in the form data. This leads to erroneous behavior where only the last value is considered, causing validation errors and ultimately returning a status code of 422 instead of the expected 200.

The GitHub issue highlights the specific problem of only the last key=value winning in the case of repeated keys in form data. This explains why the tests are failing and why the function needs to be fixed to handle repeated keys properly.

## Bug Cause
The bug in the current implementation stems from how the function processes the received form data when there are multiple values for the same key. The function only considers the last value, leading to incorrect validation and status code responses.

## Strategy for Fixing the Bug
To fix the bug, we need to modify the logic in the `request_body_to_args` function so that it correctly handles cases where there are repeated keys in the form data. Specifically, we need to update the step where the values are extracted from the received body to ensure that all values for the same key are captured when necessary.

## Corrected Version of the Function

```python
async def request_body_to_args(
    required_params: List[ModelField],
    received_body: Optional[Union[Dict[str, Any], FormData]],
) -> Tuple[Dict[str, Any], List[ErrorWrapper]]:
    values = {}
    errors = []

    if required_params:
        for field in required_params:
            value: Any = None
            if received_body is not None:
                if field.shape in sequence_shapes and isinstance(received_body, FormData):
                    values[field.alias] = received_body.getlist(field.alias)
                else:
                    value = received_body.get(field.alias)

            if value is None:
                if field.required:
                    if PYDANTIC_1:
                        errors.append(ErrorWrapper(MissingError(), loc=("body", field.alias)))
                    else:
                        errors.append(ErrorWrapper(MissingError(), loc=("body", field.alias), config=BaseConfig))
                else:
                    values[field.name] = deepcopy(field.default)
                continue

            if isinstance(field_info, params.File) and lenient_issubclass(field.type_, bytes) and isinstance(value, UploadFile):
                value = await value.read()
            elif field.shape in sequence_shapes and isinstance(field_info, params.File) and lenient_issubclass(field.type_, bytes) and isinstance(value, sequence_types):
                awaitables = [sub_value.read() for sub_value in value]
                contents = await asyncio.gather(*awaitables)
                value = sequence_shape_to_type[field.shape](contents)

            v_, errors_ = field.validate(value, values, loc=("body", field.alias))
            if isinstance(errors_, ErrorWrapper):
                errors.append(errors_)
            elif isinstance(errors_, list):
                errors.extend(errors_)
            else:
                values[field.name] = v_

    return values, errors
```

In the corrected version of the function, the logic for handling repeated keys in form data has been updated. Instead of replacing values for the same key, now all values are captured in a list under the key when `field.shape` indicates a sequence shape. This modification ensures that all values are considered during validation, addressing the bug identified in the failing tests and the GitHub issue.
