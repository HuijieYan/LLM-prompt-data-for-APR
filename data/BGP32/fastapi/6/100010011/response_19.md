### Analysis:
The buggy function, `request_body_to_args`, is responsible for converting received request body data into arguments based on required parameters. The function iterates over the required parameters, retrieves the corresponding values from the received body, validates them, and handles errors accordingly.

The function fails to properly handle scenario where certain parameters are expected to be in a sequence shape like lists, sets, or tuples from form data. Due to this issue, the validation fails for list parameters that are sent as form data.

### Identified Issue:
The issue stems from how the function processes received form data for parameters with sequence shapes. When processing form data, the function treats the values corresponding to sequence parameters incorrectly, leading to validation errors.

### Bug Cause:
The cause of the bug is the mishandling of sequence-shaped parameters in the form data processing logic. The function does not correctly extract and validate values for parameters that are expected to be sequence types. This results in validation errors and status code 422 instead of the expected 200.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to adjust how the function processes parameters with sequence shapes in the form data. Proper extraction and validation of values for these parameters should be implemented to ensure that the validation passes successfully. By correctly handling sequence-shaped parameters, we can resolve the validation errors and ensure that the status code 200 is returned as expected.

### Corrected Function:
Here's the corrected version of the `request_body_to_args` function:

```python
async def request_body_to_args(
    required_params: List[ModelField],
    received_body: Optional[Union[Dict[str, Any], FormData]],
) -> Tuple[Dict[str, Any], List[ErrorWrapper]]:
    values = {}
    errors = []
    sequence_shapes = {"list", "set", "tuple"}
    if required_params:
        for field in required_params:
            value: Any = None
            if received_body is not None:
                if field.shape in sequence_shapes and isinstance(
                    received_body, FormData
                ):
                    raw_value = received_body.getlist(field.alias)
                    if field.shape == "list":
                        value = raw_value
                    elif field.shape == "set":
                        value = set(raw_value)
                    elif field.shape == "tuple":
                        value = tuple(raw_value)
                else:
                    value = received_body.get(field.alias)
            if value is None:
                if field.required:
                    errors.append(
                        ErrorWrapper(MissingError(), loc=("body", field.alias))
                    )
                else:
                    values[field.name] = deepcopy(field.default)
            else:
                v_, errors_ = field.validate(value, values, loc=("body", field.alias))
                if isinstance(errors_, ErrorWrapper):
                    errors.append(errors_)
                elif isinstance(errors_, list):
                    errors.extend(errors_)
                else:
                    values[field.name] = v_
    return values, errors
```

In this corrected version, when processing form data for sequence-shaped parameters, the function correctly extracts the values, converts them to the appropriate sequence type (list, set, or tuple), and then validates them. This adjustment ensures that the validation process works as expected for such parameters, resolving the validation errors observed in the tests.
