### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `request_body_to_args` is responsible for converting the received request body data into arguments for a request.
2. The error message indicates that the response status code is expected to be 200, but it is actually returning a 422 status code.
3. The bug may be related to how the function processes the received data in form of Python lists, sets, and tuples, causing validation issues.
4. The GitHub issue suggests that handling repeated keys in form data is not working as expected, which might be affecting the validation process in this function.

### Bug Cause:
The bug arises from how the function processes repeated keys/values in form data for lists, sets, and tuples. It may be overwriting values or not handling them correctly, leading to validation errors.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that repeated keys/values in form data are correctly handled and converted into lists, sets, or tuples before validation. This would align with the request handling expectations and resolve the validation issues.

### Corrected Function:
```python
async def request_body_to_args(
    required_params: List[ModelField],
    received_body: Optional[Union[Dict[str, Any], FormData]],
) -> Tuple[Dict[str, Any], List[ErrorWrapper]]:
    values = {}
    errors = []
    for field in required_params:
        value: Any = None
        if received_body is not None:
            if field.shape in sequence_shapes and isinstance(
                received_body, FormData
            ):
                value = received_body.getlist(field.alias)
                if len(value) == 1: # Handle single values differently
                    value = value[0]
            else:
                value = received_body.get(field.alias)
        
        if value is None or (isinstance(field_info, params.Form) and value == "") or (
            isinstance(field_info, params.Form)
            and field.shape in sequence_shapes
            and len(value) == 0
        ):
            if field.required:
                if PYDANTIC_1:
                    errors.append(
                        ErrorWrapper(MissingError(), loc=("body", field.alias))
                    )
                else:
                    errors.append(
                        ErrorWrapper(
                            MissingError(),
                            loc=("body", field.alias),
                            config=BaseConfig,
                        )
                    )
            else:
                values[field.name] = deepcopy(field.default)
        else:
            if isinstance(field_info, params.File) and lenient_issubclass(field.type_, bytes) and isinstance(value, UploadFile):
                value = await value.read()
            v_, errors_ = field.validate(value, values, loc=("body", field.alias))
            if isinstance(errors_, ErrorWrapper):
                errors.append(errors_)
            elif isinstance(errors_, list):
                errors.extend(errors_)
            else:
                values[field.name] = v_
    return values, errors
```

The corrected version of the function now correctly handles cases where multiple values are present for a single key in form data, ensuring they are processed as expected. This should resolve the validation issues and align with the behavior requested in the GitHub issue.
