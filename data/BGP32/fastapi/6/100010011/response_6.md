### Analysis:
The buggy function `request_body_to_args` is responsible for converting received data into arguments for a FastAPI dependency operation. The function attempts to extract values from the received data based on the required parameters specified.

The error messages from the failing tests indicate that the status code returned by the responses is `422` while the expected status code is `200`. This discrepancy suggests that the data is not being processed correctly by the `request_body_to_args` function.

Looking at the GitHub issue related to supporting repeated key=value pairs in form data, it seems that the issue is indeed related to how the function handles form data with repeated keys, causing only the last key=value to be processed.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is likely caused by how the function processes form data with repeated keys. When multiple values are provided for the same key in the form data, only the last value is considered due to how the function is structured.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug and support repeated key=value pairs in form data, the function needs to be updated to handle multiple values associated with the same key properly. Instead of overwriting the values for the same key, they should be collected into a list before validation.

### Corrected Function:
Here is the corrected version of the `request_body_to_args` function:

```python
async def request_body_to_args(
    required_params: List[ModelField],
    received_body: Optional[Union[Dict[str, Any], FormData]],
) -> Tuple[Dict[str, Any], List[ErrorWrapper]]:
    values = {}
    errors = []
    if required_params:
        for field in required_params:
            value: Any = None
            if received_body is not None:
                if field.shape in sequence_shapes and isinstance(
                    received_body, FormData
                ):
                    value = received_body.getlist(field.alias)
                else:
                    value = received_body.get(field.alias)
            if value is None or value == [""]:
                if field.required:
                    errors.append(ErrorWrapper(MissingError(), loc=("body", field.alias))
                else:
                    values[field.name] = deepcopy(field.default)
                continue
            if (
                isinstance(field_info, params.File)
                and lenient_issubclass(field.type_, bytes)
                and isinstance(value, list)
            ):
                new_values = []
                for val in value:
                    if isinstance(val, UploadFile):
                        new_values.append(await val.read())
                    else:
                        new_values.append(val)
                value = new_values
            v_, errors_ = field.validate(value, values, loc=("body", field.alias))
            if isinstance(errors_, ErrorWrapper):
                errors.append(errors_)
            elif isinstance(errors_, list):
                errors.extend(errors_)
            else:
                values[field.name] = v_
    return values, errors
```

### Explanation:
The corrected function above introduces a loop to handle multiple values associated with the same key in form data. It collects all values for the same key into a list before validation, ensuring that all values are considered during the processing.

By making this change, the function will now support repeated key=value pairs in form data and resolve the issue of only the last value being processed. This should result in the correct validation of form data and the tests passing with the expected status code of `200`.
