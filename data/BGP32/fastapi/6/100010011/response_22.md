### Analyzing the buggy function and the error message:
1. The error message indicates that the response status code is 422, but the test expects it to be 200.
2. The error is likely occurring due to issues in the `request_body_to_args` function where values are not being processed correctly, leading to validation errors.
3. The issue reported on GitHub suggests that there is a problem with handling repeated key=value pairs in form data, which aligns with the existing bug.

### Potential error locations:
1. Processing of values from the received body.
2. Handling of sequence shapes and file uploads.
3. Validation of the field values.

### Cause of the bug:
The bug in the function `request_body_to_args` prevents correct processing and validation of values, especially when dealing with sequence shapes like lists, sets, and tuples. This leads to validation errors and results in a 422 response code.

### Strategy for fixing the bug:
1. Ensure that repeated key=value pairs in form data are collected correctly.
2. Verify that the values extracted from the received body are handled appropriately.
3. Correctly process sequence shapes and file uploads.
4. Modify the validation process to avoid errors.

### Corrected version of the function:
```python
async def request_body_to_args(
    required_params: List[ModelField],
    received_body: Optional[Union[Dict[str, Any], FormData]],
) -> Tuple[Dict[str, Any], List[ErrorWrapper]]:
    values = {}
    errors = []

    for field in required_params:
        value: Any = None
        if received_body is not None:
            if field.shape in sequence_shapes and isinstance(received_body, FormData):
                value = received_body.getlist(field.alias)
            else:
                value = received_body.get(field.alias)

        if (
            value is None
            or (
                isinstance(field_info, params.Form)
                and isinstance(value, str) and value == ""
                and not field.required
            )
            or (
                field.shape in sequence_shapes
                and len(value) == 0
                and isinstance(value, list)
            )
        ):
            if field.required:
                errors.append(
                    ErrorWrapper(MissingError(), loc=("body", field.alias))
                )
            else:
                values[field.name] = deepcopy(field.default)
        else:
            if (
                isinstance(field_info, params.File)
                and lenient_issubclass(field.type_, bytes)
                and isinstance(value, UploadFile)
            ):
                value = await value.read()
            elif (
                field.shape in sequence_shapes
                and isinstance(field_info, params.File)
                and lenient_issubclass(field.type_, bytes)
                and isinstance(value, list)
            ):
                awaitables = [sub_value.read() for sub_value in value]
                contents = await asyncio.gather(*awaitables)
                value = sequence_shape_to_type[field.shape](contents)
            v_, errors_ = field.validate(value, values, loc=("body", field.alias))
            if isinstance(errors_, ErrorWrapper):
                errors.append(errors_)
            elif isinstance(errors_, list):
                errors.extend(errors_)
            else:
                values[field.alias] = v_

    return values, errors
```

By applying the corrections to handle values properly, validate sequence shapes, and address the repeated key=value pair issue mentioned in the GitHub report, the corrected version of the function should resolve the bug causing the test failures.
