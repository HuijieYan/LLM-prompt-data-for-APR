## Analysis:
The buggy function `request_body_to_args` is responsible for extracting values from the request body based on required parameters. The function is used to convert form data into a dictionary of values and a list of errors. The error message from the failing tests indicates that the function is not handling repeated keys in form data correctly, resulting in validation errors.

## Bugs in the function:
1. The function does not correctly handle repeated keys in form data.
2. The logic for extracting values from the form data is flawed.
3. Values from form data are not correctly assigned to the corresponding field aliases.

## Cause of the bug:
The cause of the bug is that the function does not handle repeated keys in form data when extracting values. When multiple values with the same key are present in the form data, only the last value is being extracted and validated, leading to unexpected behavior during validation.

## Strategy for fixing the bug:
To fix the bug, we need to modify the logic of the `request_body_to_args` function to properly handle repeated keys in form data. We should collect all values associated with a repeated key and store them as a list for that key, ensuring that all values are considered during validation.

## Correction:
```python
async def request_body_to_args(
    required_params: List[ModelField],
    received_body: Optional[Union[Dict[str, Any], FormData]],
) -> Tuple[Dict[str, Any], List[ErrorWrapper]]:
    values = {}
    errors = []
    if required_params:
        for field in required_params:
            values[field.name] = None
            if received_body is not None:
                if field.shape in sequence_shapes and isinstance(received_body, FormData):
                    value = received_body.getlist(field.alias)
                else:
                    value = received_body.get(field.alias)
                if value is not None:
                    if field.shape in sequence_shapes:
                        values[field.name] = value
                    else:
                        values[field.name] = value[0] if isinstance(value, list) and len(value) == 1 else value

        for field in required_params:
            if values[field.name] is None:
                if field.required:
                    if PYDANTIC_1:
                        errors.append(ErrorWrapper(MissingError(), loc=("body", field.alias)))
                    else:
                        errors.append(ErrorWrapper(MissingError(), loc=("body", field.alias), config=BaseConfig)
                else:
                    values[field.name] = deepcopy(field.default)
            else:
                v_, errors_ = field.validate(values[field.name], values, loc=("body", field.alias))
                if isinstance(errors_, ErrorWrapper):
                    errors.append(errors_)
                elif isinstance(errors_, list):
                    errors.extend(errors_)
                else:
                    values[field.name] = v_
    return values, errors
```

In the corrected version, the function properly handles repeated keys in form data by assigning multiple values for a key to a list under that key. This ensures that all values are considered during validation, fixing the issue reported in the failing tests and the GitHub issue.
