### Analysis:
- The buggy function `request_body_to_args` is responsible for extracting values from the received body based on required parameters.
- The error messages from the failing tests indicate that the function is not handling form data with Python list, set, and tuple types correctly.
- The issue in GitHub suggests that FastAPI should support repeated keys in form data, which is not currently implemented in the buggy function.

### Potential Error Locations:
1. Handling repeated keys in form data for Python list, set, and tuple types.
2. Validating and extracting values for parameters correctly.

### Cause of the Bug:
The bug is caused by the function not correctly handling form data with repeated keys for Python list, set, and tuple types. It only retrieves the last value instead of collecting all values into a list, causing validation errors and the status code mismatch.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
1. Check if the received body has multiple values for a parameter and collect them into a list.
2. Update the validation logic to handle lists, sets, and tuples for form data correctly.
3. Ensure that all values for a parameter are considered during validation and extraction.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
async def request_body_to_args(
    required_params: List[ModelField],
    received_body: Optional[Union[Dict[str, Any], FormData]],
) -> Tuple[Dict[str, Any], List[ErrorWrapper]]:
    values = {}
    errors = []
    if required_params:
        for field in required_params:
            value: Any = None
            if received_body is not None:
                if field.alias in received_body:
                    raw_values = received_body.getlist(field.alias) if isinstance(received_body, FormData) else [received_body[field.alias]]
                    if field.shape in sequence_shapes:
                        value = sequence_shape_to_type[field.shape](raw_values)
                    else:
                        value = raw_values[0] if len(raw_values) == 1 else raw_values
                
            if value is None or (isinstance(field_info, params.Form) and value == ""):
                if field.required:
                    errors.append(ErrorWrapper(MissingError(), loc=("body", field.alias))
                else:
                    values[field.name] = deepcopy(field.default)
            else:
                v_, errors_ = field.validate(value, values, loc=("body", field.alias))
                if isinstance(errors_, ErrorWrapper):
                    errors.append(errors_)
                elif isinstance(errors_, list):
                    errors.extend(errors_)
                else:
                    values[field.name] = v_
    return values, errors
```

In the corrected version of the function, we iterate over each required parameter and handle form data with repeated keys correctly. If a parameter has multiple values, we collect them into a list and handle lists, sets, and tuples accordingly during validation. This change ensures that all values for a parameter are considered and the validation process is executed correctly.
