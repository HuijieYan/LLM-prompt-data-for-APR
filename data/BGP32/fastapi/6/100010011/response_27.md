### Analysis and Bug Identification
The buggy function `request_body_to_args` is responsible for extracting values from the received body based on the required parameters and validating them. Based on the error messages and the GitHub issue related to supporting repeated key=value pairs in form data, it seems that the issue lies in the handling of repeated keys in the received body.

The error messages indicate that the status code returned from the API is 422 instead of the expected 200. This discrepancy suggests that the validation of the form data is failing due to how repeated keys are handled.

### Bug Explanation
The bug occurs because the current implementation of `request_body_to_args` does not properly handle repeated keys in form data when validating the parameters. As suggested in the GitHub issue, the function is not collecting repeated keys in a way that allows for validation against all values.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To address the bug, we need to modify the logic within the `request_body_to_args` function to properly handle repeated keys in form data. Specifically, when extracting values from the received body, we should accumulate all values associated with a repeated key into a list structure to allow for validation against all values.

### Corrected Version
Here is the corrected version of the `request_body_to_args` function:

```python
async def request_body_to_args(
    required_params: List[ModelField],
    received_body: Optional[Union[Dict[str, Any], FormData]],
) -> Tuple[Dict[str, Any], List[ErrorWrapper]]:
    values = {}
    errors = []
    
    def get_item_value(item):
        return item[1] if isinstance(item, tuple) else item

    if required_params:
        for field in required_params:
            raw_value = received_body.getlist(field.alias) if isinstance(received_body, FormData) else received_body.get(field.alias)

            if raw_value is None:
                if field.required:
                    errors.append(
                        ErrorWrapper(MissingError(), loc=("body", field.alias))
                    )
                else:
                    values[field.name] = deepcopy(field.default)
            else:
                value = [get_item_value(item) for item in raw_value.items()]

                if isinstance(field_info, params.File) and lenient_issubclass(field.type_, bytes):
                    if len(value) == 1:
                        value = value[0]
                    else:
                        value = [await item.read() for item in value]

                v_, errors_ = field.validate(value, values, loc=("body", field.alias))
                if isinstance(errors_, ErrorWrapper):
                    errors.append(errors_)
                elif isinstance(errors_, list):
                    errors.extend(errors_)
                else:
                    values[field.name] = v_
    
    return values, errors
```

In this corrected version, the function now properly handles repeated keys in form data by accumulating all values associated with a key into a list. This modification allows for validation against all values associated with a key, addressing the issue reported in the failing tests and the GitHub issue.
