### Analysis:
The function `request_body_to_args` is responsible for converting the received body data into arguments based on the required parameters. The error messages in the failing tests indicate that the response status code is 422 instead of the expected 200. This discrepancy suggests that there is an issue with how the function is handling form data, especially with sequences like lists, sets, and tuples. The GitHub issue further clarifies that repeated keys in form data are not being handled correctly.

### Potential Error:
- Incorrect handling of form data with repeated keys leading to validation issues.
- Handling of sequences (lists, sets, tuples) within the form data is not effective.

### Bug Explanation:
The bug causes issues when handling the form data with sequences like lists, sets, and tuples where repeated keys may exist. The function is not able to process and validate such scenarios properly. This results in incorrect validation and hence the failing tests reporting status code 422.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to modify how the function processes form data with repeated keys and sequences. The approach should involve aggregating values for repeated keys into lists before validation and ensure correct handling of different sequence types.

### Corrected Function:
Here is the corrected version of the `request_body_to_args` function:

```python
async def request_body_to_args(
    required_params: List[ModelField],
    received_body: Optional[Union[Dict[str, Any], FormData]],
) -> Tuple[Dict[str, Any], List[ErrorWrapper]]:
    values = {}
    errors = []
    
    if required_params:
        for field in required_params:
            value = None
            if received_body is not None:
                if field.shape in sequence_shapes and isinstance(received_body, FormData):
                    if field.alias in received_body.keys():
                        value = received_body.getlist(field.alias)
                else:
                    value = received_body.get(field.alias)

            if value is None:
                if field.required:
                    errors.append(ErrorWrapper(MissingError(), loc=("body", field.alias)))
                else:
                    values[field.name] = deepcopy(field.default)
                continue

            if isinstance(field_info, params.File) and lenient_issubclass(field.type_, bytes) and isinstance(value, UploadFile):
                value = await value.read()
            
            v_, errors_ = field.validate(value, values, loc=("body", field.alias))
            if isinstance(errors_, ErrorWrapper):
                errors.append(errors_)
            elif isinstance(errors_, list):
                errors.extend(errors_)
            else:
                values[field.name] = v_

    return values, errors
```

In the corrected version:
1. Repeated keys in form data are correctly handled by checking if the alias key exists and retrieving the list of values.
2. The processing of sequences within form data is more robust with the correct validation and assignment of values.
3. The function now ensures that all required parameters are validated properly without missing any values.

By using this revised version of the function, the bug should be resolved, and the failing tests should now pass with the correct response status code of 200.
