### Analysis:
The error message indicates that the function is returning a status code of 422 (unprocessable entity) instead of 200 (successful) when handling requests with Python lists, sets, or tuples as form data. This behavior is inconsistent with the expected outcome of the test cases.

Based on the provided function and the error messages from failing tests, the issue is likely related to how the function processes form data with repeated keys or sequences such as lists, sets, and tuples.

### Error Cause:
The bug occurs because the `request_body_to_args` function does not handle repeated keys in form data correctly. When processing form data with repeated keys, the function only processes the last value associated with each key, leading to incorrect validation results and status codes.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to modify the `request_body_to_args` function to correctly handle repeated keys in form data. Each value associated with a repeated key should be collected and stored as a list in the final dictionary of values to ensure that all values are considered during validation.

### Corrected Version:
Here is the corrected version of the `request_body_to_args` function:

```python
async def request_body_to_args(
    required_params: List[ModelField],
    received_body: Optional[Union[Dict[str, Any], FormData]],
) -> Tuple[Dict[str, Any], List[ErrorWrapper]]:
    values = {}
    errors = []
    for field in required_params:
        alias = field.alias
        values[alias] = []
        if received_body is not None:
            if field.shape in sequence_shapes and isinstance(received_body, FormData):
                values[alias] = received_body.getlist(alias)
            else:
                value = received_body.get(alias)
                if value is not None:
                    values[alias].append(value)

    for field in required_params:
        alias = field.alias
        value = values[alias]
        values.pop(alias)
        values[field.name] = value

        field_info = get_field_info(field)
        for v in value:
            v_, errors_ = field.validate(v, values, loc=("body", alias))
            if isinstance(errors_, ErrorWrapper):
                errors.append(errors_)
            elif isinstance(errors_, list):
                errors.extend(errors_)
            else:
                values[field.name] = v_

    return values, errors
```

This corrected version will properly collect and store all values associated with repeated keys in form data as lists during processing and validation, ensuring that the validation results are accurate and the status codes match the expectations.

By implementing this correction, the function should now correctly handle form data with repeated keys or sequences, resolving the issue reported in the GitHub thread and passing the failing tests.
