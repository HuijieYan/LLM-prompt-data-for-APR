### Analysis:
- The buggy function `request_body_to_args` is responsible for parsing the request body to extract values for required parameters.
- The failing tests are related to passing Python list, set, and tuple parameters as form data to endpoints and expecting a successful response (status code 200).
- The issue reported on GitHub suggests that FastAPI should handle repeated keys in form data properly to be able to validate against all values.
- The bug is likely related to the handling of repeated keys in form data leading to validation issues for Python list, set, and tuple parameters.

### Bug Cause:
- The bug occurs because when parsing form data with repeated keys, only the last value is considered instead of aggregating all values under the same key.
- This behavior fails the validation for sequence shapes like list, set, and tuple, as only one value is being processed, leading to a validation error.

### Fix Strategy:
- Modify the logic of handling repeated keys in form data to aggregate all values under the same key.
- Ensure that sequence shapes are correctly processed and validated against all values within the form data.

### Corrected Version:
```python
async def request_body_to_args(
    required_params: List[ModelField],
    received_body: Optional[Union[Dict[str, Any], FormData]],
) -> Tuple[Dict[str, Any], List[ErrorWrapper]]:
    values = {}
    errors = []
    if required_params:
        for field in required_params:
            value: Any = None
            if received_body is not None:
                if field.shape in sequence_shapes and isinstance(
                    received_body, FormData
                ):
                    if field.alias in received_body:
                        value = received_body.getlist(field.alias)
                    else:
                        value = []
                else:
                    value = received_body.get(field.alias)
            if (
                value is None
                or (isinstance(field_info, params.Form) and value == "")
                or (
                    isinstance(field_info, params.Form)
                    and field.shape in sequence_shapes
                    and len(value) == 0
                )
            ):
                if field.required:
                    if PYDANTIC_1:
                        errors.append(
                            ErrorWrapper(MissingError(), loc=("body", field.alias))
                        )
                    else:  # pragma: nocover
                        errors.append(
                            ErrorWrapper(  # type: ignore
                                MissingError(),
                                loc=("body", field.alias),
                                config=BaseConfig,
                            )
                        )
                else:
                    values[field.name] = deepcopy(field.default)
                continue
            if (
                isinstance(field_info, params.File)
                and lenient_issubclass(field.type_, bytes)
                and isinstance(value, UploadFile)
            ):
                value = await value.read()
            elif (
                field.shape in sequence_shapes
                and isinstance(field_info, params.File)
                and lenient_issubclass(field.type_, bytes)
                and isinstance(value, sequence_types)
            ):
                awaitables = [sub_value.read() for sub_value in value]
                contents = await asyncio.gather(*awaitables)
                value = sequence_shape_to_type[field.shape](contents)
            v_, errors_ = field.validate(value, values, loc=("body", field.alias))
            if isinstance(errors_, ErrorWrapper):
                errors.append(errors_)
            elif isinstance(errors_, list):
                errors.extend(errors_)
            else:
                values[field.name] = v_
    return values, errors
```

### Summary:
- The corrected version includes the modification to properly handle repeated keys in form data.
- Each value under the same key is aggregated into a list for sequence shape validation.
- This fix addresses the reported issue on GitHub and should resolve the failing tests for Python list, set, and tuple parameters passed as form data.
