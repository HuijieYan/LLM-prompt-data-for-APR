### Analysis:
The buggy function `request_body_to_args` is responsible for converting the received body data into arguments for the request. The issue in the function is related to processing repeated keys in form data when handling sequences such as lists, sets, and tuples.

From the failing tests, it is evident that the function is not handling repeated keys correctly, resulting in a status code of 422 instead of the expected 200. This issue is reflected in the GitHub issue titled "Support repeated key=value in form data".

### Error Location:
The main error seems to be in the section where the function processes fields with shape in sequence_shapes (i.e., lists, sets, tuples) and checks if the data is of type FormData. The function fails to correctly handle repeated keys in form data for sequences.

### Cause of the Bug:
The bug is caused by the function not correctly processing repeated keys in form data, leading to only the last key=value pair being considered rather than collecting all values for a repeated key.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to modify the logic that handles sequences in form data to correctly collect and process all values for repeated keys. This requires updating the conditional checks and value assignments for repeated keys in the form data.

### Corrected Version:
Below is the corrected version of the `request_body_to_args` function that addresses the bug:

```python
async def request_body_to_args(
    required_params: List[ModelField],
    received_body: Optional[Union[Dict[str, Any], FormData]]
) -> Tuple[Dict[str, Any], List[ErrorWrapper]]:
    values = {}
    errors = []
    
    for field in required_params:
        value: Any = None
        if received_body is not None:
            if field.shape in sequence_shapes and isinstance(received_body, FormData):
                if field.alias in received_body:
                    if field.shape in sequence_shapes:
                        value = received_body.getlist(field.alias)
                    else:
                        value = received_body.get(field.alias)
            else:
                value = received_body.get(field.alias) if field.alias in received_body else None

        if value is None or value == "" or len(value) == 0:
            if field.required:
                errors.append(ErrorWrapper(MissingError(), loc=("body", field.alias)))
            else:
                values[field.name] = deepcopy(field.default)
        else:
            if field.shape in sequence_shapes and isinstance(value, list) and lenient_issubclass(field.type_, str):
                values[field.name] = value
            else:
                v_, errors_ = field.validate(value, values, loc=("body", field.alias))
                if isinstance(errors_, ErrorWrapper):
                    errors.append(errors_)
                elif isinstance(errors_, list):
                    errors.extend(errors_)
                else:
                    values[field.name] = v_

    return values, errors
```

This corrected version ensures that the function correctly processes repeated keys in form data for sequences like lists, sets, and tuples, allowing them to be validated against all values. It fixes the bug related to processing repeated key=value pairs in form data for request validation.
