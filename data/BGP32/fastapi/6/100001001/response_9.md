### Issue Analysis
The function `request_body_to_args` is intended to convert received request body parameters into arguments based on required parameters. However, there seems to be a bug in how the function handles different types of field shapes (e.g., list, set, tuple) and when processing FormData inputs.

1. The logic for handling sequence shapes (list, set, tuple) might not be properly identifying and processing the elements.
2. The conditional checks for different field shapes and file types may not be accurately mapping to the expected operations.
3. The handling of errors might be incorrect, leading to unexpected error behavior.

### Bug Explanation
The bug seems to occur when the function tries to process an input FormData with multiple items in a field for sequence types (e.g., list, set, tuple). This leads to errors generated due to improper processing of the values, which are not correctly mapped to the field requirements.

### Bug Fix Strategy
1. Ensure that the logic properly handles the different shapes of fields (list, set, tuple) when processing FormData inputs.
2. Correctly evaluate the conditionals for field shapes and file types to perform the appropriate data extraction and processing.
3. Refine the error handling mechanism to accurately report missing or incorrect values.

### Corrected Version
```python
async def request_body_to_args(
    required_params: List[ModelField],
    received_body: Optional[Union[Dict[str, Any], FormData]],
) -> Tuple[Dict[str, Any], List[ErrorWrapper]]:
    values = {}
    errors = []
    if required_params:
        if len(required_params) == 1:
            field = required_params[0]
            field_info = get_field_info(field)
            embed = getattr(field_info, "embed", None)
            if not embed:
                received_body = {field.alias: received_body}
        for field in required_params:
            value: Any = None
            if received_body is not None:
                if field.shape in sequence_shapes and isinstance(
                    received_body, FormData
                ):
                    value = received_body.getlist(field.alias)
                else:
                    value = received_body.get(field.alias)
            if (
                value is None
                or (isinstance(field_info, params.Form) and value == "")
                or (
                    isinstance(field_info, params.Form)
                    and field.shape in sequence_shapes
                    and len(value) == 0
                )
            ):
                if field.required:
                    errors.append(
                        ErrorWrapper(MissingError(), loc=("body", field.alias))
                    )
                else:
                    values[field.name] = deepcopy(field.default)
                continue
            if (
                isinstance(field_info, params.File)
                and lenient_issubclass(field.type_, bytes)
                and isinstance(value, UploadFile)
            ):
                value = await value.read()
            elif (
                field.shape in sequence_shapes
                and (isinstance(field_info, params.File) or isinstance(field_info, params.Form))
                and lenient_issubclass(field.type_, bytes)
                and isinstance(value, sequence_types)
            ):
                awaitables = [sub_value.read() for sub_value in value]
                contents = await asyncio.gather(*awaitables)
                value = sequence_shape_to_type[field.shape](contents)
            v_, errors_ = field.validate(value, values, loc=("body", field.alias))
            if isinstance(errors_, ErrorWrapper):
                errors.append(errors_)
            elif isinstance(errors_, list):
                errors.extend(errors_)
            else:
                values[field.name] = v_
    return values, errors
``` 

In the corrected version, the handling of different field shapes and FormData inputs is improved to ensure proper extraction and processing of values. Error reporting is refined to accurately capture missing or incorrect values during the validation process.
