Based on the provided buggy function and the runtime input/output values, the bug seems to be caused by incorrectly handling sequence-shaped fields (i.e., lists, sets, tuples) in the function `request_body_to_args`.

The function attempts to handle sequence-shaped fields in the received body, but it encounters issues when dealing with them. The bug can be observed through the failing tests, where the function incorrectly handles the sequence-shaped data in the received body, leading to the generation of error wrappers regardless of the actual data structure.

To fix the bug in the function, we need to adjust how sequence-shaped fields are processed to ensure that the correct data is extracted and validated. Specifically, we need to appropriately handle sequence-shaped values in the received body and ensure that error wrappers are only produced when necessary.

Here is the corrected version of the function `request_body_to_args`:

```python
async def request_body_to_args(
    required_params: List[ModelField],
    received_body: Optional[Union[Dict[str, Any], FormData]],
) -> Tuple[Dict[str, Any], List[ErrorWrapper]]:
    values = {}
    errors = []
    for field in required_params:
        value: Any = None
        if received_body is not None:
            if field.shape in sequence_shapes and isinstance(received_body, FormData):
                # Check if the field alias is present in the received body
                if field.alias in received_body.keys():
                    if field.shape == len(received_body.getlist(field.alias)):
                        value = received_body.getlist(field.alias)
            else:
                value = received_body.get(field.alias)
        if value is None or (isinstance(field_info, params.Form) and value == ""):
            if field.required:
                errors.append(
                    ErrorWrapper(MissingError(), loc=("body", field.alias))
                )
            else:
                values[field.alias] = deepcopy(field.default)
        else:
            v_, errors_ = field.validate(value, values, loc=("body", field.alias))
            if isinstance(errors_, ErrorWrapper):
                errors.append(errors_)
            elif isinstance(errors_, list):
                errors.extend(errors_)
            else:
                values[field.name] = v_
    return values, errors
```

In the fixed version, we have made adjustments to how sequence-shaped fields are processed within the function. We now correctly handle sequence-shaped values in the received body based on the field alias. This ensures that the correct data is extracted and validated for sequence-shaped fields, reducing the unnecessary generation of error wrappers.
