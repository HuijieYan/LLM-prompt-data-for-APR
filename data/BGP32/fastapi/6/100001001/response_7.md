### Bug Explanation
The buggy function `request_body_to_args` is designed to extract values from a request body (either a dictionary or FormData) based on the required parameters provided. However, the bug arises from how the function handles sequences within the request body, leading to errors related to missing or incorrect values being extracted.

1. In the provided cases, it can be observed that the function is not correctly extracting sequences like lists, sets, or tuples from the request body when they are present. This results in the function failing to populate the `values` dictionary accurately with the extracted values.

2. The error stems from the logic within the function that attempts to handle sequences (such as lists) from the request body. The function fails to appropriately handle cases where sequences need to be extracted, leading to missing or incorrect values being processed.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug in the `request_body_to_args` function, it is crucial to ensure that sequences within the request body (e.g., lists, sets, tuples) are extracted correctly and processed according to their shapes. Below is a suggested strategy to address the bug:

1. When handling sequences:
   - Check if the field's shape is indicative of a sequence type.
   - Extract sequence values appropriately, considering whether the data needs to be acquired as individual elements or as a whole sequence.

2. Update the logic for processing sequences to match the expected behavior based on the field's shape and related information.

3. Handle the validation and assignment of extracted sequence values correctly to populate the `values` dictionary.

### Corrected Version of the Function
After considering the issues identified and the strategy outlined, here is the corrected version of the `request_body_to_args` function:

```python
async def request_body_to_args(
    required_params: List[ModelField],
    received_body: Optional[Union[Dict[str, Any], FormData]],
) -> Tuple[Dict[str, Any], List[ErrorWrapper]]:
    values = {}
    errors = []
    
    for field in required_params:
        value: Any = None
        if received_body is not None:
            value = received_body.get(field.alias)
            if field.shape in sequence_shapes and isinstance(value, list):
                value = [received_body.get(alias) for alias in get_path_param_names(field.alias)]
        if value is None or (isinstance(field_info, params.Form) and value == ""):
            if field.required:
                if PYDANTIC_1:
                    errors.append(ErrorWrapper(MissingError(), loc=("body", field.alias)))
                else:  # pragma: nocover
                    errors.append(ErrorWrapper(MissingError(), loc=("body", field.alias), config=BaseConfig))
            else:
                values[field.name] = deepcopy(field.default)
        else:
            v_, errors_ = field.validate(value, values, loc=("body", field.alias))
            if isinstance(errors_, ErrorWrapper):
                errors.append(errors_)
            elif isinstance(errors_, list):
                errors.extend(errors_)
            else:
                values[field.name] = v_
    
    return values, errors
```

This corrected version should address the issues related to handling sequences within the request body and ensure that values are extracted and processed correctly, ultimately populating the `values` dictionary as expected.
