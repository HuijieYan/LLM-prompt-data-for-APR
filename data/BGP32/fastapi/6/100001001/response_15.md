The bug in the `request_body_to_args` function seems to be related to how it handles different shapes of body parameters, such as lists, sets, and tuples. The function is designed to process received data (in the form of a dictionary or FormData) based on the required parameters defined in the `required_params`.

The cases provided show that the function is not handling the scenario where the received data shape does not match the expected shape of the required parameter. This results in errors being appended without properly validating the received values.

To fix this bug, we should update the logic for handling different shapes of body parameters. Specifically, we need to check if the field's shape matches the expected shape and handle the data accordingly.

Here is a corrected version of the function:

```python
async def request_body_to_args(
    required_params: List[ModelField],
    received_body: Optional[Union[Dict[str, Any], FormData]],
) -> Tuple[Dict[str, Any], List[ErrorWrapper]]:
    values = {}
    errors = []
    for field in required_params:
        value: Any = None
        if received_body is not None:
            if field.alias not in received_body:
                if field.required:
                    errors.append(
                        ErrorWrapper(MissingError(), loc=("body", field.alias))
                    )
                else:
                    values[field.name] = deepcopy(field.default)
                continue
            
            value = received_body.get(field.alias)

            if isinstance(field.type_, Sequence) and not isinstance(value, list):
                value = [value]  # Ensure the value is treated as a list (sequence)

            if isinstance(field_info, params.File) and lenient_issubclass(field.type_, bytes):
                if isinstance(value, UploadFile):
                    value = await value.read()
                elif isinstance(value, List) and all(isinstance(item, UploadFile) for item in value):
                    awaitables = [item.read() for item in value]
                    value = [await val for val in awaitables]

            v_, errors_ = field.validate(value, values, loc=("body", field.alias))
            if isinstance(errors_, ErrorWrapper):
                errors.append(errors_)
            elif isinstance(errors_, list):
                errors.extend(errors_)
            else:
                values[field.name] = v_

    return values, errors
```

This corrected version ensures that the function handles different shapes of body parameters appropriately and validates the received data accordingly. It also addresses the scenarios where the received data needs to be transformed before validation.
