### Bug Analysis:
The buggy function `request_body_to_args` is designed to extract values from a request body and validate them against required parameters. However, there are issues with how it handles sequences like lists, sets, and tuples within the request body. The function seems to struggle with correctly processing the received sequence values and generating errors when validation fails.

### Bug Explanation:
1. In Case 1, the code incorrectly processes a list received in the request body. It generates an error for the `items` field despite receiving values in the FormData.
2. In Case 2, the code attempts to handle a set instead of a list, resulting in a similar error while trying to validate the values.
3. In Case 3, the code fails to correctly process a tuple received in the request body, leading to validation errors.

### Bug Fix:
To fix the bug, we need to adjust how the function handles sequences and ensure that it can properly validate list, set, and tuple values.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
async def request_body_to_args(
    required_params: List[ModelField],
    received_body: Optional[Union[Dict[str, Any], FormData]],
) -> Tuple[Dict[str, Any], List[ErrorWrapper]]:
    values = {}
    errors = []
    if required_params:
        for field in required_params:
            value: Any = None
            if received_body is not None:
                if field.shape in sequence_shapes:  # Check if field is a sequence
                    value = received_body.getlist(field.alias)
                else:
                    value = received_body.get(field.alias)
            if value is None or (isinstance(field_info, params.Form) and value == ""):
                if field.required:
                    errors.append(
                        ErrorWrapper(MissingError(), loc=("body", field.alias))
                    )
                else:
                    values[field.name] = deepcopy(field.default)
                continue
            # Handle specific case for files in a sequence
            if isinstance(value, list) and all(isinstance(item, UploadFile) for item in value):
                value = await asyncio.gather(*(item.read() for item in value))
            v_, errors_ = field.validate(value, values, loc=("body", field.alias))
            if isinstance(errors_, ErrorWrapper):
                errors.append(errors_)
            elif isinstance(errors_, list):
                errors.extend(errors_)
            else:
                values[field.name] = v_
    return values, errors
```

In the corrected version:
- We directly check if the field is a sequence and retrieve its values accordingly.
- We handle the case where the field contains a list of UploadFiles and read their content asynchronously.
- The function should now be able to correctly process sequences in the request body and validate them without generating unnecessary errors.
