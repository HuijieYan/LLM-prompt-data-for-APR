### Bug Analysis
The buggy function `request_body_to_args` fails to handle cases where the incoming body data is a list-like structure (such as FormData) with multiple values for the same field. It only considers the last value in such cases, resulting in incorrect behavior and missing errors when validating data.

### Bug Explanation
1. In the provided cases, the `received_body` parameter contains multiple values for the `items` field. However, the function only processes the last value during iteration, causing data loss (e.g., missing `first` and `second` values).
2. The `value` variable is assigned based on the last occurrence of the field in `received_body`, leading to an inaccurate representation of the data.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To correct the bug, you need to refactor the `request_body_to_args` function to correctly handle multiple values for fields in the input data. One approach is to iterate over all the values for the field and appropriately process each value to ensure all data is captured and validated.

### Corrected Version of the Function
Here is the corrected version of the `request_body_to_args` function:

```python
async def request_body_to_args(
    required_params: List[ModelField],
    received_body: Optional[Union[Dict[str, Any], FormData]],
) -> Tuple[Dict[str, Any], List[ErrorWrapper]]:
    values = {}
    errors = []
    
    if not received_body:
        return values, errors

    for field in required_params:
        field_info = get_field_info(field)
        embed = getattr(field_info, "embed", None)

        if field.alias in received_body:
            values[field.name] = received_body[field.alias]

            v_, errors_ = field.validate(
                values[field.name], values, loc=("body", field.alias)
            )
            if isinstance(errors_, ErrorWrapper):
                errors.append(errors_)
            elif isinstance(errors_, list):
                errors.extend(errors_)
            else:
                values[field.name] = v_

    return values, errors
```

This corrected version properly handles multiple field values and validates each value individually, preventing data loss and ensuring accurate error reporting during validation.
