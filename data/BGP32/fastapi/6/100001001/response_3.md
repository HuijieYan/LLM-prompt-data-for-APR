### Bug Analysis:
1. The function `request_body_to_args` is designed to convert received body parameters into a dictionary of values and a list of errors based on the required parameters provided.
2. In the provided buggy function, it seems that there is an issue with handling sequence shapes such as lists, sets, and tuples within the received body, leading to incorrect validation and error generation.
3. The bug arises when the function tries to handle sequence shapes like lists, sets, and tuples in the received body, causing the validation process to fail and generate incorrect errors.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Ensure that the function correctly processes sequence shapes within the received body.
2. Validate the sequence shape fields appropriately to handle multiple values and avoid errors for required parameters.
3. Update the logic related to sequence shapes to handle cases where the received body contains multiple values for the same field.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
async def request_body_to_args(
    required_params: List[ModelField],
    received_body: Optional[Union[Dict[str, Any], FormData]],
) -> Tuple[Dict[str, Any], List[ErrorWrapper]]:
    values = {}
    errors = []
    for field in required_params:
        value: Any = None
        if received_body is not None:
            if field.shape in sequence_shapes and isinstance(received_body, FormData):
                if field.alias in received_body:
                    if field.shape == 1:
                        value = received_body[field.alias]
                    else:
                        value = received_body.getlist(field.alias)
            else:
                value = received_body.get(field.alias)
        if value is None or value == "" or (field.shape in sequence_shapes and len(value) == 0):
            if field.required:
                errors.append(
                    ErrorWrapper(MissingError(), loc=("body", field.alias))
                )
            else:
                values[field.name] = deepcopy(field.default)
        else:
            if isinstance(field_info, params.File) and lenient_issubclass(field.type_, bytes) and isinstance(value, UploadFile):
                value = await value.read()
            v_, errors_ = field.validate(value, values, loc=("body", field.alias))
            if isinstance(errors_, ErrorWrapper):
                errors.append(errors_)
            elif isinstance(errors_, list):
                errors.extend(errors_)
            else:
                values[field.name] = v_
    return values, errors
```

In the corrected version:
- The function handles sequence shapes correctly by checking if the field alias exists in the received body and then processing the value accordingly.
- Validation and error generation are updated to account for sequence shapes and multiple values in the received body.
- The logic for handling FormData with sequence shapes like lists is improved.
