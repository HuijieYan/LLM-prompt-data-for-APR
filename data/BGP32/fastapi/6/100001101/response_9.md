The buggy function `request_body_to_args` is intended to extract values from the received request body based on the required parameters and return any errors encountered during the process. However, the function has a bug that prevents it from working correctly, resulting in incorrect outputs.

### Bug Explanation:
- The bug in the function arises when handling different shapes of fields (like list, set, tuple).
- In the current implementation, the function incorrectly tries to access the received body for a single field without considering the shape of the field.
- This leads to errors in processing multiple values for the same field or processing different field shapes like sets or tuples.
- The bug also affects file uploads and their processing within the function, leading to incorrect behavior.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
- To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the function correctly processes multiple values for a single field and handles different field shapes like lists, sets, and tuples appropriately.
- We should also address the handling of file uploads, ensuring that they are read and processed correctly.

### Corrected Function:
```python
async def request_body_to_args(
    required_params: List[ModelField],
    received_body: Optional[Union[Dict[str, Any], FormData]],
) -> Tuple[Dict[str, Any], List[ErrorWrapper]]:
    values = {}
    errors = []
    for field in required_params:
        value = None
        if received_body:
            if field.shape in sequence_shapes and isinstance(received_body, FormData):
                value = received_body.getlist(field.alias)
            else:
                value = received_body.get(field.alias)
        
        if value is None or not value:
            if field.required:
                errors.append(
                    ErrorWrapper(MissingError(), loc=("body", field.alias))
                )
            else:
                values[field.name] = deepcopy(field.default)
        else:
            if isinstance(field_info, params.File) and lenient_issubclass(field.type_, bytes):
                if isinstance(value, UploadFile):
                    value = await value.read()
                elif field.shape in sequence_shapes and isinstance(value, sequence_types):
                    awaitables = [sub_value.read() for sub_value in value]
                    contents = await asyncio.gather(*awaitables)
                    value = sequence_shape_to_type[field.shape](contents)
            
            v_, errors_ = field.validate(value, values, loc=("body", field.alias))
            if isinstance(errors_, ErrorWrapper):
                errors.append(errors_)
            elif isinstance(errors_, list):
                errors.extend(errors_)
            else:
                values[field.name] = v_
            
    return values, errors
```

### Changes Made:
- Updated the for loop to iterate over all required params correctly.
- Improved handling of values for different field shapes like lists, sets, and tuples.
- Corrected processing of file uploads to read and process them correctly.

By correcting the function based on the provided fix, the cases mentioned should now work as expected and produce the desired output.
