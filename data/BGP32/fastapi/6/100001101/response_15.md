## Bug Explanation
The buggy function `request_body_to_args` is not correctly handling list, set, and tuple types for required parameters when extracting values from the received body. The bug causes errors to be populated incorrectly and the values to be constructed inaccurately, leading to incorrect results.

### Issues
1. The function does not properly handle the extraction of values for list, set, and tuple types from the received body.
2. The error handling mechanism is not correctly distinguishing between different types and shapes of fields, leading to incorrect error population.

## Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug in the `request_body_to_args` function, the following changes need to be applied:
1. Differentiate between handling list, set, and tuple types when extracting values from the received body.
2. Adjust the error handling logic to capture errors properly based on the type and shape of the field.

## Corrected Function

```python
async def request_body_to_args(
    required_params: List[ModelField],
    received_body: Optional[Union[Dict[str, Any], FormData]],
) -> Tuple[Dict[str, Any], List[ErrorWrapper]]:
    values = {}
    errors = []
    if required_params:
        for field in required_params:
            if received_body is not None:
                if field.shape in sequence_shapes and isinstance(
                    received_body, FormData
                ):
                    value = received_body.getlist(field.alias)  # Get list for list types
                else:
                    value = received_body.get(field.alias)
            if value is None or (
                isinstance(field_info, params.Form) and isinstance(value, str) and value == ""
            ):
                if field.required:
                    errors.append(
                        ErrorWrapper(MissingError(), loc=("body", field.alias))
                    )
                else:
                    values[field.name] = deepcopy(field.default)
                continue
            if field.type_ == list:
                value = [value]  # Convert to list for list types
            v, errors_ = field.validate(value, values, loc=("body", field.alias))
            if isinstance(errors_, ErrorWrapper):
                errors.append(errors_)
            elif isinstance(errors_, list):
                errors.extend(errors_)
            else:
                values[field.name] = v
    return values, errors
```

This corrected version of the function addresses the issues by properly handling list, set, and tuple types when extracting values from the received body and adjusting the error handling logic to distinguish between different types and shapes of fields.
