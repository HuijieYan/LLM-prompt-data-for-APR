The buggy function `request_body_to_args` is failing to correctly handle multiple values for a field when the received data is of type `FormData`. The function is not properly converting the received data into the expected format, leading to errors in validation and generation of the output values.

The root cause of the bug is that the function is not handling multi-valued fields appropriately when extracting values from `FormData`. It is assumed that a single value is being extracted for each field, which is incorrect for fields that can have multiple values.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the logic for processing fields when the received data is of type `FormData`. We should identify and handle multi-valued fields correctly to capture all the values and transform them into the desired data structure.

Here is the corrected version of the `request_body_to_args` function:

```python
async def request_body_to_args(
    required_params: List[ModelField],
    received_body: Optional[Union[Dict[str, Any], FormData]],
) -> Tuple[Dict[str, Any], List[ErrorWrapper]]:
    values = {}
    errors = []
    
    if received_body is not None and isinstance(received_body, FormData):
        for field in required_params:
            value: Any = received_body.getlist(field.alias)
            
            if not value:
                if field.required:
                    errors.append(ErrorWrapper(MissingError(), loc=("body", field.alias)))
                else:
                    values[field.name] = deepcopy(field.default)
            else:
                v_, errors_ = field.validate(value, values, loc=("body", field.alias))
                if isinstance(errors_, list):
                    errors.extend(errors_)
                else:
                    values[field.name] = v_
    
    return values, errors
```

With this correction, the function will correctly handle multi-valued fields from `FormData` and generate the expected output values based on the provided input parameters. The function now properly extracts and processes all values for each field, resolving the bug.
