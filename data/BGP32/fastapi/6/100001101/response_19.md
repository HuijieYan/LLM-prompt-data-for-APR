The bug in the provided function `request_body_to_args` stems from incorrectly processing the received body data when converting it to arguments. The function fails to handle sequences properly, leading to errors in constructing the values dictionary and the errors list.

The specific issue arises when dealing with sequences like lists, sets, or tuples in the received body. The function does not correctly extract values from the received body for sequence-shaped fields, resulting in errors such as `MissingError`.

To fix the bug, we need to update the logic for processing sequence-shaped fields in the received body data. Specifically, we should ensure that the function correctly extracts and processes values for such fields before attempting to validate them.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
async def request_body_to_args(
    required_params: List[ModelField],
    received_body: Optional[Union[Dict[str, Any], FormData]],
) -> Tuple[Dict[str, Any], List[ErrorWrapper]]:
    values = {}
    errors = []
    if required_params:
        for field in required_params:
            if received_body is not None:
                if field.shape in sequence_shapes and isinstance(received_body, FormData):
                    values[field.name] = received_body.getlist(field.alias)
                else:
                    value = received_body.get(field.alias)
                    if value is not None:
                        if isinstance(field_info, params.File) and lenient_issubclass(field.type_, bytes) and isinstance(value, UploadFile):
                            value = await value.read()
                        v_, errors_ = field.validate(value, values, loc=("body", field.alias))
                        if isinstance(errors_, ErrorWrapper):
                            errors.append(errors_)
                        elif isinstance(errors_, list):
                            errors.extend(errors_)
                        else:
                            values[field.name] = v_
                    elif field.required:
                        if PYDANTIC_1:
                            errors.append(ErrorWrapper(MissingError(), loc=("body", field.alias)))
                        else:
                            errors.append(ErrorWrapper(MissingError(), loc=("body", field.alias), config=BaseConfig)
    return values, errors
```

In the corrected version:
1. We check if the field shape corresponds to a sequence shape and handle this case by extracting the values correctly from the received body.
2. We have added an additional check to validate the extracted value before adding it to the final dictionary of values.
3. Errors are appended only if the field is required and a value is missing.

Applying these modifications should resolve the issues with processing sequence-shaped fields and improve the overall functionality of the function.
