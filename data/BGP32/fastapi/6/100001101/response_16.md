### Bug Explanation:
The bug in the provided function occurs due to an incorrect handling of the input data when it contains multiple values for a single field. The function is designed to process form data and convert it into arguments based on the required parameters. However, when a field in the required parameters list has multiple values in the received body (e.g., a list, set, or tuple), the function does not correctly extract and handle these values, leading to errors and incorrect results.

### Bug Location:
The issue primarily arises in the part of the code that deals with extracting values from the received body for fields with multiple occurrences. It does not account for cases where the field may have multiple values and therefore incorrectly processes the data.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix this bug, we need to modify the logic for handling fields with multiple occurrences in the received body. This can involve updating how values are extracted and stored for such fields to ensure correct processing and conversion to arguments.

### Corrected Version:
Below is the corrected version of the function that addresses the bug and aligns with the expected input/output values provided in the test cases.

```python
async def request_body_to_args(
    required_params: List[ModelField],
    received_body: Optional[Union[Dict[str, Any], FormData]],
) -> Tuple[Dict[str, Any], List[ErrorWrapper]]:
    values = {}
    errors = []
    
    for field in required_params:
        value: Any = None
        if received_body is not None:
            data = received_body.getlist(field.alias) if isinstance(received_body, FormData) else received_body.get(field.alias)
            if data is not None:
                if lenient_issubclass(field.outer_type_, (list, set, tuple, Sequence)):
                    value = data
                else:
                    value = data[0] if isinstance(data, list) else data
                
        if value is None:
            if field.required:
                errors.append(ErrorWrapper(MissingError(), loc=("body", field.alias)))
            else:
                values[field.name] = deepcopy(field.default)
        else:
            v_, errors_ = field.validate(value, values, loc=("body", field.alias))
            if isinstance(errors_, ErrorWrapper):
                errors.append(errors_)
            elif isinstance(errors_, list):
                errors.extend(errors_)
            else:
                values[field.name] = v_

    return values, errors
```

### The corrected function now correctly extracts and processes multiple values for fields, ensuring that the output aligns with the expected input/output values for the provided test cases.
