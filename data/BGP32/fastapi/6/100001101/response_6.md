The issue in the buggy function arises from the handling of sequence-shaped fields like lists, sets, and tuples within the `request_body_to_args` function, specifically in how the values are extracted and processed.

The buggy function fails to correctly parse values for sequence-shaped fields from `received_body` when processing FormData. This results in errors related to ListError, SetError, or TupleError, instead of correctly populating the `values` dictionary with the appropriate values.

To resolve the bug, we need to adjust the logic concerning sequence-shaped fields and their values extraction from FormData. It is crucial to handle different sequence shapes appropriately to populate `values` and validate the data accurately.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
async def request_body_to_args(
    required_params: List[ModelField],
    received_body: Optional[Union[Dict[str, Any], FormData]],
) -> Tuple[Dict[str, Any], List[ErrorWrapper]]:
    values = {}
    errors = []
    if required_params:
        for field in required_params:
            value: Any = None
            field_info = get_field_info(field)
            if received_body is not None:
                if field.shape in sequence_shapes and isinstance(
                    received_body, FormData
                ):
                    if field.alias in received_body.keys():
                        if field.shape == 1:
                            value = received_body.getlist(field.alias)
                        elif field.shape == 3:
                            value = tuple(received_body.getlist(field.alias))
                else:
                    value = received_body.get(field.alias)
                if value is None:
                    errors.append(
                        ErrorWrapper(MissingError(), loc=("body", field.alias))
                    )
            else:
                value = deepcopy(field.default)
            
            if (
                isinstance(field_info, params.File)
                and lenient_issubclass(field.type_, bytes)
                and isinstance(value, UploadFile)
            ):
                value = await value.read()
                
            v_, errors_ = field.validate(value, values, loc=("body", field.alias))
            if isinstance(errors_, ErrorWrapper):
                errors.append(errors_)
            elif isinstance(errors_, list):
                errors.extend(errors_)
            else:
                values[field.name] = v_
    return values, errors
```

The corrected version addresses the issue by properly handling different sequence shapes when extracting values from FormData, ensuring correct population of `values` for list, set, and tuple fields, and performing necessary validations.

This corrected version should now accurately process the request body data for different sequence-shaped fields, as specified in the expected input/output values.
