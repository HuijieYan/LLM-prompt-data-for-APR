### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `request_body_to_args` is intended to extract values from a request body based on the required parameters provided and validate them.
2. The function focuses on checking the presence and validity of the received data and populating the `values` dict accordingly.
3. The function seems to encounter issues when handling repeated key-value pairs in form data, leading to validation errors and potentially incorrect extraction of values.
4. The failing tests indicate that the expected status codes are 200, but the actual ones are 422, which suggests validation errors.
5. The GitHub issue also points out the problem with repeated key=value pairs in form data that are not handled properly.

### Bug Cause:
1. The function doesn't handle repeated key-value pairs correctly, which results in only the last value being considered, causing validation errors and incorrect extractions.
2. The function's logic for handling input data like FormData and the required parameters is flawed, impacting the extraction and validation process.
3. Errors arise due to the inability to properly gather and process repeated keys for certain shapes like list, set, and tuple.

### Fix Strategy:
1. Modify the function to handle repeated key-value pairs in the FormData properly, ensuring that all values are considered during extraction and validation.
2. Improve the logic for checking shape and processing values based on the field's characteristics.
3. Ensure that the function correctly populates the `values` dict and handles validation errors appropriately.
4. Adjust the logic to account for possible variations in the input data structure and shape, particularly for sequences like list, set, and tuple.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
async def request_body_to_args(
    required_params: List[ModelField],
    received_body: Optional[Union[Dict[str, Any], FormData]],
) -> Tuple[Dict[str, Any], List[ErrorWrapper]]:
    values = {}
    errors = []
    if required_params:
        for field in required_params:
            value: Any = None
            if isinstance(received_body, FormData):
                if field.shape in sequence_shapes:
                    value = received_body.getlist(field.alias)
                else:
                    value = received_body.get(field.alias)
            if (
                value is None
                or (isinstance(field_info, params.Form) and value == "")
                or (
                    isinstance(field_info, params.Form)
                    and field.shape in sequence_shapes
                    and len(value) == 0
                )
            ):
                if field.required:
                    errors.append(ErrorWrapper(MissingError(), loc=("body", field.alias))
                else:
                    values[field.name] = deepcopy(field.default)
                continue
            if (
                isinstance(field_info, params.File)
                and lenient_issubclass(field.type_, bytes)
                and isinstance(value, UploadFile)
            ):
                value = await value.read()
            elif (
                field.shape in sequence_shapes
                and isinstance(field_info, params.File)
                and lenient_issubclass(field.type_, bytes)
                and isinstance(value, sequence_types)
            ):
                awaitables = [sub_value.read() for sub_value in value]
                contents = await asyncio.gather(*awaitables)
                value = sequence_shape_to_type[field.shape](contents)
            v_, errors_ = field.validate(value, values, loc=("body", field.alias))
            if isinstance(errors_, ErrorWrapper):
                errors.append(errors_)
            elif isinstance(errors_, list):
                errors.extend(errors_)
            else:
                values[field.name] = v_
    return values, errors
```

By adjusting the logic in the corrected function, handling repeated key-value pairs in the `FormData` object appropriately, the function should now be able to process and validate the data correctly according to the requirements.
