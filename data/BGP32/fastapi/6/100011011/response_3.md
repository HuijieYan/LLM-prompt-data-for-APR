### Analysis and Explanation:
The bug in the `request_body_to_args` function seems related to handling sequences such as lists, sets, and tuples when passed as form data in FastAPI. The error message indicates that the response status code is 422 (Unprocessable Entity) instead of the expected 200. This discrepancy suggests that the input data is not being processed correctly, leading to validation failures.

From the runtime values and types analysis in the cases provided:
1. The function processes the form data with multiple items under the same key incorrectly, leading to only the last value being considered.
2. The function initializes `value` based on the field alias, but it should account for sequence shapes and type validations.
3. Errors are constructed considering the field's required status and presence of values but do not handle sequence types appropriately.

The GitHub issue raised further highlights the limitation in handling repeated keys in form data scenarios, where the behavior differs from the expected result.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Modify how values are extracted from form data for sequence-shaped fields.
2. Properly validate and handle values for sequence types to address the issue of only the last value being considered.
3. Adjust the error handling logic to account for repetitive key-value pairs within form data inputs.

### Corrected Function:
```python
async def request_body_to_args(
    required_params: List[ModelField],
    received_body: Optional[Union[Dict[str, Any], FormData]],
) -> Tuple[Dict[str, Any], List[ErrorWrapper]]:
    values = {}
    errors = []
    
    sequence_shapes = {1}  # Supporting only lists, sets, and tuples
    
    if required_params:
        for field in required_params:
            value: Any = None
            if received_body is not None:
                if field.shape in sequence_shapes and isinstance(received_body, FormData):
                    if field.alias in received_body:
                        value = received_body.getlist(field.alias)
                else:
                    value = received_body.get(field.alias)
                    
            if value is None or (isinstance(field.info, params.Form) and value == "") or (
                isinstance(field.info, params.Form) and field.shape in sequence_shapes and len(value) == 0
            ):
                if field.required:
                    errors.append(ErrorWrapper(MissingError(), loc=("body", field.alias)))
                else:
                    values[field.name] = deepcopy(field.default)
            else:
                if field.shape in sequence_shapes and value:
                    value = [await sub_value.read() for sub_value in value]
                v_, errors_ = field.validate(value, values, loc=("body", field.alias))
                if isinstance(errors_, ErrorWrapper):
                    errors.append(errors_)
                elif isinstance(errors_, list):
                    errors.extend(errors_)
                else:
                    values[field.name] = v_
    
    return values, errors
```

This corrected function account for the correct extraction, validation, and handling of values from form data, especially for sequences like lists, sets, and tuples.

I hope this helps in resolving the issue and the failing tests associated with handling non-typing sequences in FastAPI form data processing.
