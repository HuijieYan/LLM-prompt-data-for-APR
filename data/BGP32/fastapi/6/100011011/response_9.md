## Analysis and Bug Understanding

### Issue:
The failing tests are expecting a status code of 200, but the actual status code is 422 (Unprocessable Entity).

### Bug:
The `request_body_to_args` function has a bug where it is not correctly handling repeated keys in form data. This bug is causing validation errors and leading to the incorrect status code.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is occurring because when handling repeated keys in form data, the function does not aggregate them into a list as expected. Instead, it only considers the last value for each key. This behavior is not in line with the expectations of the tests, which provide multiple values for the same key like ['first', 'second', 'third'] for the key 'items'. Due to this, validation errors are raised, and the status code ends up being 422 instead of 200.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix this bug, we need to modify the function to correctly handle repeated keys in form data. Instead of overriding the value for a key with each occurrence, we should aggregate them into a list for further processing and validation.

### Corrected Version of the Function:

```python
async def request_body_to_args(
    required_params: List[ModelField],
    received_body: Optional[Union[Dict[str, Any], FormData]],
) -> Tuple[Dict[str, Any], List[ErrorWrapper]]:
    values = {}
    errors = []
    if required_params:
        for field in required_params:
            value: Any = None
            if received_body is not None:
                if field.shape in sequence_shapes and isinstance(
                    received_body, FormData
                ):
                    value = received_body.getlist(field.alias)
                else:
                    value = received_body.get(field.alias)
                
                # Correct handling of repeated keys: aggregate values into a list
                if field.shape in sequence_shapes and isinstance(value, list):
                    value = value + [v for k, v in received_body.items() if k == field.alias]
                
            if (
                value is None
                or (isinstance(field_info, params.Form) and value == "")
                or (
                    isinstance(field_info, params.Form)
                    and field.shape in sequence_shapes
                    and len(value) == 0
                )
            ):
                if field.required:
                    if PYDANTIC_1:
                        errors.append(
                            ErrorWrapper(MissingError(), loc=("body", field.alias))
                        )
                    else:  # pragma: nocover
                        errors.append(
                            ErrorWrapper(
                                MissingError(),
                                loc=("body", field.alias),
                                config=BaseConfig,
                            )
                        )
                else:
                    values[field.name] = deepcopy(field.default)
                continue
            # Rest of the validation remains the same
```

By making this correction in the function to properly handle repeated keys and aggregate the values into a list, the bug causing the failing tests should be resolved. This fix aligns with the expectations outlined in the GitHub issue mentioned.
