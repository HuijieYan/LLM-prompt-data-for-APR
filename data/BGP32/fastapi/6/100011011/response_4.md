### Analysis:
- The function `request_body_to_args` is responsible for extracting data for required parameters from the received body (a dictionary or FormData object) and validating them.
- The error messages indicate that the function is not handling non-typing sequences (list, set, tuple) correctly when they are passed as form data.
- The function seems to be restructuring the received body incorrectly for parameters that are not marked with the `embed` attribute.
- The error messages in the failing tests are related to the status code not matching the expected 200 status code.
- The runtime values show that errors are being generated due to incorrect handling of the values in the received body for non-typing sequences when they should be treated as lists.
- The GitHub issue suggests that FastAPI should collect repeated keys in form data and assign those values as a list to the same key before validation.

### Bug Cause:
- The bug is caused by the incorrect restructuring of the received body for non-typing sequences (list, set, tuple) when they are passed as form data. This leads to validation errors and incorrect extraction of values.
- The function does not handle repeated keys in form data correctly, which is highlighted by the failing tests and the GitHub issue.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
- Modify the logic in the function to properly handle non-typing sequences in form data.
- Ensure that data for non-typing sequences is correctly extracted and processed as lists to match the anticipated behavior mentioned in the GitHub issue.
- Implement a mechanism to collect repeated keys in form data and assign those values as a list to the same key before validation.
- Update the extraction and validation process for parameters to handle repeating keys appropriately.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
async def request_body_to_args(
    required_params: List[ModelField],
    received_body: Optional[Union[Dict[str, Any], FormData]],
) -> Tuple[Dict[str, Any], List[ErrorWrapper]]:
    values = {}
    errors = []
    if required_params:
        field = required_params[0]
        for field in required_params:
            value: Any = None
            if received_body is not None:
                value = received_body.getlist(field.alias) if isinstance(received_body, FormData) else received_body.get(field.alias)
            if value is not None:
                if (
                    isinstance(field, ModelField)
                    and field.shape in sequence_shapes
                    and isinstance(value, sequence_types)
                ):
                    value = [item.decode("utf-8") for item in value]
                v_, errors_ = field.validate(value, values, loc=("body", field.alias))
                if isinstance(errors_, ErrorWrapper):
                    errors.append(errors_)
                elif isinstance(errors_, list):
                    errors.extend(errors_)
                else:
                    values[field.name] = v_
                    
    return values, errors
```

In the corrected version of the function:
- Extract the field value using `getlist` for FormData objects to correctly handle non-typing sequences like lists.
- Convert byte values to utf-8 decoded strings to match the expected data type.
- Implement the logic to validate and store the extracted values appropriately.
- This corrected version should address the issue with handling non-typing sequences in form data and ensure that the function passes the failing tests.
