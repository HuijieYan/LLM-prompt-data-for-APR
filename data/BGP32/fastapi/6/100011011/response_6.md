### Analysis
The buggy function `request_body_to_args` is responsible for converting received body data into arguments based on required parameters. The error message suggests a status code mismatch due to incorrect processing of form data. The function processes the received body and validates the values against the required parameters.

Examining the runtime values for the failing test cases in the buggy function, we see that the function is not handling repeated keys in form data correctly. The issues stem from the loop iterating over the required parameters and assigning values to the corresponding keys in the `values` dictionary. Repeated keys in form data are parsed as individual values, which leads to validation errors.

This behavior aligns with the GitHub issue's description, where the repeated keys in form data should be collected and represented as a list under the same key.

### Bug Explanation
The bug arises from the way the function processes repeated keys in form data. Instead of collecting repeated keys and bundling their values into a list, the function assigns individual values as separate entries for the same key. This results in incorrect validation and error handling, leading to status code mismatch in the tests.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, the function should identify repeated keys in the form data and consolidate their values into a list to validate against the corresponding required parameters. By handling repeated keys correctly, the function can accurately represent the form data and ensure proper validation.

### Corrected Version of the Function
Here is a corrected version of the `request_body_to_args` function that addresses the issue:

```python
async def request_body_to_args(
    required_params: List[ModelField],
    received_body: Optional[Union[Dict[str, Any], FormData]],
) -> Tuple[Dict[str, Any], List[ErrorWrapper]]:
    values = {}
    errors = []
    
    if required_params:
        for field in required_params:
            if received_body is not None:
                # Check for repeated keys in form data
                if field.alias in received_body and isinstance(received_body[field.alias], list):
                    value = received_body[field.alias]
                else:
                    value = received_body.get(field.alias)
                
                if value is None or value == "":
                    if field.required:
                        errors.append(
                            ErrorWrapper(MissingError(), loc=("body", field.alias))
                        )
                    else:
                        values[field.name] = deepcopy(field.default)
                        continue
                
                if isinstance(field_info, params.File) and lenient_issubclass(field.type_, bytes) and isinstance(value, sequence_types):
                    awaitables = [sub_value.read() for sub_value in value]
                    contents = await asyncio.gather(*awaitables)
                    value = sequence_shape_to_type[field.shape](contents)
                
                v_, errors_ = field.validate(value, values, loc=("body", field.alias))
                if isinstance(errors_, ErrorWrapper):
                    errors.append(errors_)
                elif isinstance(errors_, list):
                    errors.extend(errors_)
                else:
                    values[field.name] = v_
    
    return values, errors
```

In this corrected version, we check if the value corresponding to a key in the form data is a list (indicating a repeated key scenario) and handle it accordingly. By processing repeated keys correctly and consolidating their values, the function should now pass the failing tests and resolve the issue reported on GitHub.
