### Bug Analysis
- The buggy function `request_body_to_args` is responsible for extracting values from the received body based on the required parameters and handling validation errors.
- The error messages indicate that the function is not handling sequences correctly when parsing form data.
- The function's logic for handling sequences like lists, sets, and tuples from form data is flawed, leading to validation errors and status code 422 responses.
- The GitHub issue is related to handling repeated keys in form data, which aligns with the observed issue in the failing tests.

### Bug Fix Strategy
- Modify the logic related to sequence shapes and form data processing to correctly handle repeated keys.
- Ensure that sequences like lists, sets, and tuples are properly extracted and validated from form data.
- Apply the solution proposed in the GitHub issue to collect repeated keys as a list for the same key before validation.

### Corrected Function
```python
async def request_body_to_args(
    required_params: List[ModelField],
    received_body: Optional[Union[Dict[str, Any], FormData]],
) -> Tuple[Dict[str, Any], List[ErrorWrapper]]:
    values = {}
    errors = []
    
    if required_params:
        for field in required_params:
            value: Any = None
            if received_body is not None and field.alias in received_body:
                if field.shape in sequence_shapes and isinstance(received_body[field.alias], list):
                    value = received_body.getlist(field.alias)
                else:
                    value = received_body[field.alias]
            
            # Handle missing or empty values
            if value is None or (
                    isinstance(field_info, params.Form) and value == ""
            ) or (
                    isinstance(field_info, params.Form)
                    and field.shape in sequence_shapes
                    and len(value) == 0
            ):
                if field.required:
                    if PYDANTIC_1:
                        errors.append(
                            ErrorWrapper(MissingError(), loc=("body", field.alias))
                        )
                    else:
                        errors.append(
                            ErrorWrapper(
                                MissingError(),
                                loc=("body", field.alias),
                                config=BaseConfig,
                            )
                        )
                else:
                    values[field.name] = deepcopy(field.default)
                continue
            
            if (
                isinstance(field_info, params.File)
                and lenient_issubclass(field.type_, bytes)
                and isinstance(value, UploadFile)
            ):
                value = await value.read()
            elif (
                field.shape in sequence_shapes
                and isinstance(value, list)
                and all(isinstance(elem, str) for elem in value)
            ):
                value = sequence_shape_to_type[field.shape](value)

            v_, errors_ = field.validate(value, values, loc=("body", field.alias))
            
            if isinstance(errors_, ErrorWrapper):
                errors.append(errors_)
            elif isinstance(errors_, list):
                errors.extend(errors_)
            else:
                values[field.name] = v_
    
    return values, errors
```

### Changes Made
- Corrected the handling of form data to extract values based on the field alias.
- Fixed the logic for dealing with sequences by checking if the value is a list of strings before conversion.
- Applied the GitHub issue-inspired fix to properly handle repeated keys in form data.

By applying these corrections, the `request_body_to_args` function should now successfully parse and validate sequence-shaped field values from form data without raising errors, leading to successful responses in the failing tests.
