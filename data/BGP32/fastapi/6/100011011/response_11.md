### Analysis:
The buggy function `request_body_to_args` is designed to convert incoming request body data into arguments based on the provided required parameters. However, it seems to have issues handling form data when dealing with multiple values for the same key. This is evident from the failing tests in which the expected status code is 200 but the actual status code is 422.

The cases provided above show that the function fails to correctly handle input data when dealing with sequences like lists, sets, and tuples as form parameters. It leads to validation errors being raised and the function not correctly populating the values dictionary.

The issue identified in the GitHub report is related to supporting repeated key=value pairs in form data, which aligns with the problem manifested in the failing tests.

### Bug Cause:
The buggy function doesn't properly handle repeated key=value pairs in form data. It sets the value for the key in the received_body dictionary without considering that it may have multiple values for the same key. This causes validation errors when processing sequences like lists, sets, or tuples due to incorrect data handling.

### Proposed Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to modify the logic in the `request_body_to_args` function to correctly handle repeated key=value pairs in form data. The function should identify when a key has multiple values and consider them as a list for further processing.

### Corrected Version:
```python
async def request_body_to_args(
    required_params: List[ModelField],
    received_body: Optional[Union[Dict[str, Any], FormData]],
) -> Tuple[Dict[str, Any], List[ErrorWrapper]]:
    values = {}
    errors = []
    if required_params:
        for field in required_params:
            values[field.name] = deepcopy(field.default)
            if received_body is not None:
                if field.alias in received_body:
                    value = received_body.getlist(field.alias)
                    if isinstance(value, list) and len(value) == 1:
                        value = value[0]
                    if value is not None:
                        v_, errors_ = field.validate(value, values, loc=("body", field.alias))
                        if isinstance(errors_, ErrorWrapper):
                            errors.append(errors_)
                        elif isinstance(errors_, list):
                            errors.extend(errors_)
                        else:
                            values[field.name] = v_
                elif field.required:
                    errors.append(ErrorWrapper(MissingError(), loc=("body", field.alias)))
    return values, errors
```

In the corrected version, we adjusted the processing logic to correctly handle multiple values for the same key in form data. By checking if the field alias exists in the received body and then extracting values appropriately, we ensure that all values for a key are considered. This change addresses the issue and should make the function capable of properly handling form data with repeated key=value pairs.
