## Analysis
The buggy function `request_body_to_args` is intended to extract values from the received body based on required parameters' information. The bug seems to stem from how the function handles sequences (such as lists, sets, and tuples) in form data (received as `FormData`). The function incorrectly processes these sequences, leading to validation errors and a status code of 422 instead of the expected 200.

The error is related to how the function handles sequences inside form data. The function should properly extract and handle the sequence values for each key to avoid validation errors and incorrect responses.

## Bug Cause
1. The function tries to handle sequences in the form data by doing membership checks and extraction. However, this approach is not taking into account the structure of sequences correctly.
  
The bug arises when the function is expecting a single value for the input parameter, but it receives a sequence instead (where the last value in the sequence is the one being considered). This logic leads to missing parameter errors.

## Strategy for Fixing the Bug
To fix the bug, we need to modify how the function extracts values from form data when dealing with sequences. Instead of considering only the last value in the sequence, we should extract all values for the corresponding key and handle them appropriately based on the parameter type.

## Corrected Version of the Function
```python
async def request_body_to_args(
    required_params: List[ModelField],
    received_body: Optional[Union[Dict[str, Any], FormData]],
) -> Tuple[Dict[str, Any], List[ErrorWrapper]]:
    values = {}
    errors = []

    for field in required_params:
        values[field.name] = None

        if received_body is not None:
            if field.alias in received_body.keys():
                if isinstance(field.type_, type(list)) or isinstance(field.type_, type(set)) or isinstance(field.type_, type(tuple)):
                    values[field.name] = received_body.getlist(field.alias)
                else:
                    values[field.name] = received_body.get(field.alias)

    for field in required_params:
        if values[field.name] is None:
            if field.required:
                errors.append(ErrorWrapper(MissingError(), loc=("body", field.alias)))
            else:
                values[field.name] = deepcopy(field.default)
            continue

        if isinstance(field_info, params.File) and lenient_issubclass(field.type_, bytes):
            if isinstance(values[field.name], list) and all(isinstance(item, UploadFile) for item in values[field.name]):
                awaitables = [item.read() for item in values[field.name]]
                values[field.name] = await asyncio.gather(*awaitables)
            elif isinstance(values[field.name], UploadFile):
                values[field.name] = await values[field.name].read()

        v_, errors_ = field.validate(values[field.name], values, loc=("body", field.alias))
        
        if isinstance(errors_, ErrorWrapper):
            errors.append(errors_)
        elif isinstance(errors_, list):
            errors.extend(errors_)
        else:
            values[field.name] = v_

    return values, errors
```

In this corrected version of the function:
- We first extract the values for all fields of the required parameters based on the received form data.
- If the field represents a sequence (list, set, or tuple), we use `getlist` to get all values associated with that field name.
- We then process the values, handling file types if needed, and validate each value against the field's type.
- Finally, we return the extracted values and any validation errors.

This fix should address the bug and enable the function to correctly handle sequences in the form data, resolving the validation errors and providing the expected status code of 200.
