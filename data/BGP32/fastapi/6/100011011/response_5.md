## Fixing the Bug

### Analysis:
- The buggy function `request_body_to_args` is intended to process required parameters from received body data.
- The issue arises when the function encounters sequence shapes such as list, set, tuple, etc. in the received body data.
- The function does not handle repeated keys in the received form data correctly, leading to missing validation or selecting only the last value.

### Bug Cause:
- The bug stems from how the function processes sequence shapes in the received data and assigns values to them, leading to validation errors when dealing with repeated keys.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
1. Modify the logic of assigning values to handle repeated keys correctly for sequence shapes.
2. Update how values are processed for list, set, and tuple fields from the received form data.
3. Ensure that all values for sequence shapes are correctly extracted and processed before validation.

### Corrected Version of the Function:

```python
async def request_body_to_args(
    required_params: List[ModelField],
    received_body: Optional[Union[Dict[str, Any], FormData]],
) -> Tuple[Dict[str, Any], List[ErrorWrapper]]:
    values = {}
    errors = []

    if required_params:
        for field in required_params:
            value: Any = None
            if received_body is not None:
                if field.shape in sequence_shapes and isinstance(
                    received_body, FormData
                ):
                    if field.alias in received_body:
                        raw_value = received_body.getlist(field.alias)
                        value = raw_value if field.shape in sequence_shapes else raw_value[-1]
                    else:
                        value = None
                else:
                    value = received_body.get(field.alias)

            if (
                value is None
                or (isinstance(field_info, params.Form) and value == "")
                or (
                    isinstance(field_info, params.Form)
                    and field.shape in sequence_shapes
                    and len(value) == 0
                )
            ):
                if field.required:
                    if PYDANTIC_1:
                        errors.append(
                            ErrorWrapper(MissingError(), loc=("body", field.alias))
                        )
                    else:
                        errors.append(
                            ErrorWrapper(
                                MissingError(),
                                loc=("body", field.alias),
                                config=BaseConfig,
                            )
                        )
                else:
                    values[field.name] = deepcopy(field.default)
                continue

            if (
                isinstance(field_info, params.File)
                and lenient_issubclass(field.type_, bytes)
                and isinstance(value, UploadFile)
            ):
                value = await value.read()
            elif (
                field.shape in sequence_shapes
                and isinstance(field_info, params.File)
                and lenient_issubclass(field.type_, bytes)
                and isinstance(value, sequence_types)
            ):
                awaitables = [sub_value.read() for sub_value in value]
                contents = await asyncio.gather(*awaitables)
                value = sequence_shape_to_type[field.shape](contents)

            v_, errors_ = field.validate(value, values, loc=("body", field.alias))

            if isinstance(errors_, ErrorWrapper):
                errors.append(errors_)
            elif isinstance(errors_, list):
                errors.extend(errors_)
            else:
                values[field.name] = v_

    return values, errors
```

### Updated Functionality:
- The corrected function now correctly processes repeated key-value pairs for fields with sequence shapes.
- It ensures that all values for list, set, and tuple fields are correctly extracted and handled before validation.
- Repeated keys in the form data with sequence shapes will now be processed as lists.

By applying these corrections, the function should now be able to handle the described scenario accurately.
