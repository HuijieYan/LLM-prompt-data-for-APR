### Analysis
The current implementation of the `request_body_to_args` function is not handling the case where a form parameter has multiple values with the same key. This results in only the last value being processed, leading to validation errors when expecting a list, set, or tuple type parameter.

The error messages from the failing tests indicate that the expected status code is 200, but the actual status code is 422, showing a validation error.

In all cases, the function fails to correctly parse the form data containing repeated keys. It processes only the last value for parameters expected as lists, sets, or tuples, causing validation errors.

### Bug Cause
1. The current implementation overrides the received body data with each subsequent field provided in `required_params`.
2. When dealing with form data, if there are multiple values with the same key, only the last value is considered because the function reassigns `received_body` at each iteration in the loop.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to modify how multiple values with the same key are handled. Instead of overriding the received body data, we should accumulate the values for each field key. This way, the function can correctly process form data with repeated keys for parameters that expect a list, set, or tuple.

### Updated and Corrected Version of the Function
```python
async def request_body_to_args(
    required_params: List[ModelField],
    received_body: Optional[Union[Dict[str, Any], FormData]],
) -> Tuple[Dict[str, Any], List[ErrorWrapper]]:
    values = {}
    errors = []
    if required_params:
        for field in required_params:
            value: Any = None
            if received_body is not None:
                if field.shape in sequence_shapes and isinstance(
                    received_body, FormData
                ):
                    value = received_body.getlist(field.alias)
                else:
                    raw_value = received_body.get(field.alias)
                    if field.shape in sequence_shapes and isinstance(raw_value, list):
                        value = raw_value
                    else:
                        value = [raw_value]
            if value is not None and (len(value) > 1 or (len(value) == 1 and value[0] is not None)):
                if isinstance(field_info, params.File) and lenient_issubclass(field.type_, bytes) and all(isinstance(v, UploadFile) for v in value):
                    value = [await v.read() for v in value]
                elif (
                    field.shape in sequence_shapes
                    and isinstance(field_info, params.File)
                    and lenient_issubclass(field.type_, bytes)
                    and all(isinstance(v, sequence_types) for v in value)
                ):
                    awaitables = [v.read() for v in value]
                    contents = await asyncio.gather(*awaitables)
                    value = sequence_shape_to_type[field.shape](contents)
                v_, errors_ = field.validate(value, values, loc=("body", field.alias))
                if isinstance(errors_, ErrorWrapper):
                    errors.append(errors_)
                elif isinstance(errors_, list):
                    errors.extend(errors_)
                else:
                    values[field.name] = v_
            else:
                if field.required:
                    errors.append(ErrorWrapper(MissingError(), loc=("body", field.alias)))
                else:
                    values[field.name] = deepcopy(field.default)
    return values, errors
```

By updating the function to accumulate values for fields that expect sequence types from the form data, the corrected version should now be able to process repeated keys correctly and resolve the validation issues encountered in the failing tests.
