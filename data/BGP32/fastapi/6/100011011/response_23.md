### Bug Analysis
1. The buggy function `request_body_to_args` is responsible for converting request body parameters into arguments and handling validation errors. It is used in the context of FastAPI requests where form data is received and needs to be processed.
2. The error message indicates that the response status code is incorrect (422 instead of the expected 200) which implies that the validation of form data based on Python sequences is failing.
3. In each case provided, the function is incorrectly handling the presence of repeated keys in the form data, especially when dealing with sequences like lists, sets, and tuples. This leads to errors in validation and incorrect result values.
4. To fix the bug, we need to modify the logic of how repeated keys are handled for sequence-shaped parameters in form data.

### Bug Fix Strategy
1. Update the logic to correctly handle repeated keys in form data for sequence-shaped parameters.
2. Ensure that when multiple values are present for a single key, they are processed correctly and not overridden.
3. Adjust how form data with repeated keys is mapped to the required parameters, especially when dealing with lists, sets, and tuples.
4. Improve the validation process to accurately handle different sequence types in the form data.

### Corrected Version
```python

    required_params: List[ModelField],
    received_body: Optional[Union[Dict[str, Any], FormData]],
) -> Tuple[Dict[str, Any], List[ErrorWrapper]]:

    errors = []

        for field in required_params:

```

### Changes Made
1. Added a check for repeated keys within `received_body` for sequence-shaped parameters.
2. Updated how `value` is assigned and processed based on the shape of the field.
3. Implemented specific logic for lists, sets, and tuples in form data handling.
4. Updated the validation and error handling process to account for corrected data processing.

By incorporating these changes, the function should now handle sequence-shaped parameters in form data correctly and resolve the validation errors observed in the failing tests.
