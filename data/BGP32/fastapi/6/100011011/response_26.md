## Analysis
The bug in the `request_body_to_args` function is related to handling form data with repeated keys (e.g., multiple values for the same parameter). The function fails to correctly process such data and only captures the last value for a repeated key, leading to validation errors.

Looking at the runtime values and types of variables inside the function, we can see that for each failing test case, the function processes form data with multiple values for a single parameter (`'items'` in this case) but only captures the last value instead of treating them as a list/set/tuple.

The errors observed in the failing tests indicate a validation failure (e.g., ListError, SetError) due to the function not handling repeated keys as expected.

## Bug Cause
The function does not handle the scenario where a single key in the data corresponds to multiple values, resulting in only the last value being considered during processing. This leads to validation errors as the function expects a single value for the parameter but receives multiple values in the form data.

## Solution Strategy
To fix this bug, the function should be modified to correctly capture all values associated with a repeated key in the form data and treat them as a list/set/tuple based on the parameter type. By updating the logic to collect all values for a key in the form data and validate them accordingly, the function can handle scenarios where a key has multiple values provided.

## Updated Function
Here is the corrected version of the `request_body_to_args` function:

```python
async def request_body_to_args(
    required_params: List[ModelField],
    received_body: Optional[Union[Dict[str, Any], FormData]],
) -> Tuple[Dict[str, Any], List[ErrorWrapper]]:
    values = {}
    errors = []
    if required_params:
        for field in required_params:
            values[field.name] = []
            values_to_validate = []
            if received_body is not None:
                values_to_process = received_body.getlist(field.alias)
                for value in values_to_process:
                    if not value:
                        continue
                    if (
                        isinstance(field, ModelField)
                        and isinstance(field.outer_type_, Sequence)
                    ):
                        values_to_validate.append(value)
                    else:
                        values_to_validate = value
                    v_, errors_ = field.validate(values_to_validate, values, loc=("body", field.alias))
                    if isinstance(errors_, ErrorWrapper):
                        errors.append(errors_)
                    elif isinstance(errors_, list):
                        errors.extend(errors_)
                    else:
                        values[field.name].extend(v_)
    return values, errors
```

This corrected version ensures that all values associated with a repeated key are captured as a list/set/tuple depending on the parameter type, allowing for proper validation without discarding any data.
