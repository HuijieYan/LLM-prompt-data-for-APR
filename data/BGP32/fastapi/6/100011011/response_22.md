### Bug Analysis:
- The buggy function `request_body_to_args` is designed to process request body parameters and convert them into arguments to be used in endpoints.
- The bug seems to be related to handling repeated key-value pairs in form data.
- The function currently does not handle repeated keys properly and only captures the last value.

### Bug Location:
- The issue arises in the logic where the function processes the received form data and extracts values for each required parameter.
- The problem specifically occurs when dealing with sequence types like lists, sets, and tuples due to the handling of repeated keys in the `FormData`.

### Bug Cause:
- When processing form data with repeated keys, the function only captures the last value associated with a key.
- This leads to a situation where the function does not account for multiple values associated with a parameter.
- As a result, the validation step fails to handle the repeated values correctly, leading to status code 422 (validation error) instead of the expected 200 (success).

### Bug Fix Strategy:
- Modify the logic to properly handle repeated keys in form data, ensuring that all values associated with a key are captured for processing.
- Update the processing of sequence types like lists, sets, and tuples to account for multiple values.
- Adjust the validation step to correctly handle the values from repeated keys and ensure they are validated as expected.

### Corrected Function:
```python
async def request_body_to_args(
    required_params: List[ModelField],
    received_body: Optional[Union[Dict[str, Any], FormData]],
) -> Tuple[Dict[str, Any], List[ErrorWrapper]]:
    values = {}
    errors = []
    
    # Handle repeated keys in form data
    if received_body and isinstance(received_body, FormData):
        received_data = received_body.multi_items()
    else:
        received_data = []
    
    for field in required_params:
        value: Any = None
        value_list = [v[1] for k, v in received_data if k == field.alias]
        if value_list:
            if field.shape in sequence_shapes:
                value = value_list
            else:
                value = value_list[-1]  # Capture the last value
        elif field.required:
            errors.append(ErrorWrapper(MissingError(), loc=("body", field.alias)))
        else:
            values[field.name] = deepcopy(field.default)
        
        if value is not None:
            if isinstance(field_info, params.File) and lenient_issubclass(field.type_, bytes):
                if isinstance(value, UploadFile):
                    value = await value.read()
                elif all(isinstance(val, UploadFile) for val in value):
                    awaitables = [val.read() for val in value]
                    contents = await asyncio.gather(*awaitables)
                    value = sequence_shape_to_type[field.shape](contents)
            
            v_, errors_ = field.validate(value, values, loc=("body", field.alias))
            if isinstance(errors_, ErrorWrapper):
                errors.append(errors_)
            elif isinstance(errors_, list):
                errors.extend(errors_)
            else:
                values[field.name] = v_

    return values, errors
```

### Conclusion:
- The corrected function now properly handles repeated key-value pairs in form data.
- By capturing all values associated with a key, the function ensures that validation occurs correctly for sequences like lists, sets, and tuples.
- This fix should resolve the failing tests and address the issue reported on GitHub regarding the support for repeated keys in form data.
