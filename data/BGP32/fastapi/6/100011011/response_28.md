## Analysis
1. The buggy function `request_body_to_args` is responsible for extracting values from the `received_body` based on the `required_params` provided.
2. The error messages confirm that the function is failing to handle sequences properly when received as part of the form data.
3. In the runtime values, we can observe that the function is assigning only the last value associated with a key to the field, causing the validation to fail.
4. The GitHub issue supports the fact that there are problems with handling repeated key=value pairs in form data.

## Bug Cause
The bug arises from the logic where only the last value of a key in case of repeats is considered for assignment to the field. This behavior does not match the expected behavior when dealing with sequences in the form data.

## Fix Strategy
To fix this bug, we need to modify the function to handle repeated keys properly and assign all associated values to the fields of the required parameters.

## Corrected Version of the Function
```python
async def request_body_to_args(
    required_params: List[ModelField],
    received_body: Optional[Union[Dict[str, Any], FormData]],
) -> Tuple[Dict[str, Any], List[ErrorWrapper]]:
    values = {}
    errors = []
    if required_params:
        for field in required_params:
            value: Any = None
            if received_body is not None:
                if isinstance(received_body, FormData):
                    if field.shape in sequence_shapes:
                        values[field.name] = received_body.getlist(field.alias)
                    else:
                        values[field.name] = received_body.get(field.alias)
            if field.required and value is None:
                if PYDANTIC_1:
                    errors.append(
                        ErrorWrapper(MissingError(), loc=("body", field.alias))
                    )
                else:
                    errors.append(
                        ErrorWrapper(
                            MissingError(),
                            loc=("body", field.alias),
                            config=BaseConfig,
                        )
                    )
            elif value is None:
                values[field.name] = deepcopy(field.default)
            else:
                v_, errors_ = field.validate(value, values, loc=("body", field.alias))
                if isinstance(errors_, ErrorWrapper):
                    errors.append(errors_)
                elif isinstance(errors_, list):
                    errors.extend(errors_)
                else:
                    values[field.name] = v_
    return values, errors
```

After applying the above corrected version of the function, the bug should be fixed. It now properly handles repeated keys in form data while assigning values to the fields accordingly.
