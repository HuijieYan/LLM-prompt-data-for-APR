### Bug Analysis
The buggy function `request_body_to_args` is intended to handle converting received request body data into arguments based on required parameters. However, there are several issues in the current implementation that prevent correct processing of repeated keys in form data. This issue directly relates to the GitHub issue raised regarding support for repeated key=value pairs in form data.

#### Potential Error Locations
1. Incorrect handling of repeated keys in form data.
2. Lack of proper logic to accumulate repeated key=value pairs.
3. Incorrect assignment of processed values to fields.

#### Bug Cause
The bug arises from the function treating each key=value pair independently, leading to incorrect validation and missing the support for repeated keys in form data. The overwritten behavior of the form data on repeated keys results in only the last value being considered for validation.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To address the bug and align with the expectations outlined in the GitHub issue, the function needs to be modified to properly handle the accumulation of values for repeated keys before performing validation steps. This can be achieved by first identifying repeated keys in form data, grouping their values, and assigning them to the corresponding fields for validation.

### Corrected Function
```python
async def request_body_to_args(
    required_params: List[ModelField],
    received_body: Optional[Union[Dict[str, Any], FormData]],
) -> Tuple[Dict[str, Any], List[ErrorWrapper]]:
    values = {}
    errors = []
    
    # Accumulate repeated key=value pairs
    if received_body is not None and isinstance(received_body, FormData):
        repeated_keys = {}
        for key, value in received_body.items():
            if key in repeated_keys:
                repeated_keys[key].append(value)
            else:
                repeated_keys[key] = [value]
        
        # Assign accumulated values to corresponding fields
        for field in required_params:
            field_info = get_field_info(field)
            alias = field.alias
            if alias in repeated_keys:
                value = repeated_keys[alias]
            else:
                value = received_body.get(alias, None)
                
            # Validation and error handling
            v_, errors_ = field.validate(value, values, loc=("body", alias))
            if isinstance(errors_, ErrorWrapper):
                errors.append(errors_)
            elif isinstance(errors_, list):
                errors.extend(errors_)
            else:
                values[field.name] = v_
    
    return values, errors
```

### Changes Made
1. Added logic to accumulate repeated key=value pairs in form data before processing.
2. Modified the assignment of values based on accumulated data to ensure support for repeated keys.
3. Adjusted the validation and error handling steps to align with the corrected data handling approach.

By implementing these changes, the corrected function should now properly handle repeated keys in form data and provide the expected behavior as described in the GitHub issue.
