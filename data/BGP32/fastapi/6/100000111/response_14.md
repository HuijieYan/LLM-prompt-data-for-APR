### Analysis
The buggy function `request_body_to_args` is designed to extract values from the received body (either as a dictionary or FormData) based on a list of required parameters (ModelField objects). The function handles different cases based on the shape of the field and its type.

### Identified Issues
1. In the code segment `received_body = {field.alias: received_body}`, the intention seems to be to convert `received_body` into a dictionary if it is not already one. However, this code segment is raising logic issues for multi-value keys like in the GitHub issue.
2. The handling of multiple values (list, set, tuple) for the same key in FormData is missing.
3. Validation errors are handled in a way that may not align with the GitHub issue requirements.

### Bug Cause
The bug in the function is caused by the lack of proper handling for repeated keys in FormData. The function currently converts repeated keys into a dictionary, losing the information about multiple values for the same key.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug
1. Properly handle repeated keys in FormData by keeping multiple values for the same key in a list.
2. Adjust the value extraction logic to support cases where multiple values are received for a single key.

### Corrected Version of the Function

```python
async def request_body_to_args(
    required_params: List[ModelField],
    received_body: Optional[Union[Dict[str, Any], FormData]],
) -> Tuple[Dict[str, Any], List[ErrorWrapper]]:
    values = {}
    errors = []
    for field in required_params:
        field_info = get_field_info(field)
        embed = getattr(field_info, "embed", None)
        value: Any = None
        if received_body is not None:
            if isinstance(received_body, FormData):
                if field.alias in received_body:
                    raw_value = received_body.getlist(field.alias)
                    if field.shape in sequence_shapes:
                        value = raw_value
                    else:
                        value = raw_value[-1]  # Take the last value for non-sequence shapes
            else:
                value = received_body.get(field.alias)

        if value is None or (isinstance(field_info, params.Form) and value == "") or (
            isinstance(field_info, params.Form) and field.shape in sequence_shapes and len(value) == 0
        ):
            if field.required:
                errors.append(ErrorWrapper(MissingError(), loc=("body", field.alias)))
            else:
                values[field.name] = deepcopy(field.default)
        else:
            if (
                isinstance(field_info, params.File)
                and lenient_issubclass(field.type_, bytes)
                and isinstance(value, UploadFile)
            ):
                value = await value.read()
            elif (
                field.shape in sequence_shapes
                and isinstance(field_info, params.File)
                and lenient_issubclass(field.type_, bytes)
                and isinstance(value, sequence_types)
            ):
                awaitables = [sub_value.read() for sub_value in value]
                contents = await asyncio.gather(*awaitables)
                value = sequence_shape_to_type[field.shape](contents)
            v_, errors_ = field.validate(value, values, loc=("body", field.alias))
            if isinstance(errors_, ErrorWrapper):
                errors.append(errors_)
            elif isinstance(errors_, list):
                errors.extend(errors_)
            else:
                values[field.name] = v_

    return values, errors
```

### Changes Made
1. Removed the problematic code that converted `received_body` into a dictionary.
2. Updated the logic to correctly handle multiple values for the same key in FormData.
3. Adjusted the value extraction logic to handle multi-valued keys appropriately.
4. Simplified the error handling logic without losing the required checks.

By implementing these changes, the corrected function should now properly handle repeated keys in FormData and align with the requirements in the GitHub issue.
