### Issue Analysis
The buggy function `request_body_to_args` is used to process request body data into arguments based on the required parameters. The issue reported on GitHub indicates a problem with handling repeated key-value pairs in form data, which is not correctly processed in the current implementation of the function.

### Error Location
The main issue lies in the code block that processes the received data for each required parameter. The condition for handling repeated keys does not account for such cases, leading to incorrect value assignments.

### Cause of the Bug
The current implementation of the function does not handle repeated key-value pairs properly, resulting in only the last value for a key being considered. This behavior contradicts the expected functionality described in the GitHub issue, where repeated keys should be collected into a list to preserve all values.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug and address the GitHub issue, the function needs to be modified to properly handle repeated key-value pairs in form data. Specifically, when encountering repeated keys, the function should collect all corresponding values into a list under the same key. This adjustment will ensure that all values for repeated keys are preserved during the data processing.

### Corrected Function
Here is the corrected version of the function `request_body_to_args`:

```python
async def request_body_to_args(
    required_params: List[ModelField],
    received_body: Optional[Union[Dict[str, Any], FormData]],
) -> Tuple[Dict[str, Any], List[ErrorWrapper]]:
    values = {}
    errors = []
    if required_params:
        for field in required_params:
            value: Any = None
            if received_body is not None:
                if field.shape in sequence_shapes and isinstance(received_body, FormData):
                    value = received_body.getlist(field.alias)
                else:
                    value = received_body.getlist(field.alias)
            if (
                value is None
                or (isinstance(field_info, params.Form) and len(value) == 0)
            ):
                if field.required:
                    errors.append(ErrorWrapper(MissingError(), loc=("body", field.alias)))
                else:
                    values[field.name] = deepcopy(field.default)
                continue
            if (
                isinstance(field_info, params.File)
                and lenient_issubclass(field.type_, bytes)
                and all(isinstance(item, UploadFile) for item in value)
            ):
                value = [await item.read() for item in value]
            v_, errors_ = field.validate(value, values, loc=("body", field.alias))
            if isinstance(errors_, ErrorWrapper):
                errors.append(errors_)
            elif isinstance(errors_, list):
                errors.extend(errors_)
            else:
                values[field.name] = v_
    return values, errors
```

In this corrected version, the function appropriately handles repeated keys by collecting all corresponding values into a list under the same key. This modification aligns with the expected behavior outlined in the GitHub issue, thereby resolving the bug.
