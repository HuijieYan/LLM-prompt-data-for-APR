### Analysis
The `request_body_to_args` function is responsible for converting received body data into arguments based on required parameters. The bug seems to be related to handling repeated keys in form data entries. The bug may cause the function to not correctly parse repeated keys and store them as a list, potentially leading to validation issues.

### Error Location
The potential error locations could be:
1. The condition where the received body is transformed into a dictionary, especially handling repeated keys.
2. How the function iterates over required parameters without adequately handling repeated keys entry.

### Bug Cause
The bug causes the function to only capture the last value of a key if there are repetitions in the form data entries. This behavior can lead to incorrect parsing of the data and impact the validation process.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that repeated keys are properly handled and stored as lists to reflect their actual presence in the form data entries. This requires modifying the logic related to processing repeated keys and improving the handling of required parameters during iteration.

### Corrected Version of the Function
```python
async def request_body_to_args(
    required_params: List[ModelField],
    received_body: Optional[Union[Dict[str, Any], FormData]],
) -> Tuple[Dict[str, Any], List[ErrorWrapper]]:
    values = {}
    errors = []
    if required_params and received_body is not None:
        for field in required_params:
            value: Any = None
            if field.alias in received_body:
                if field.shape in sequence_shapes and isinstance(received_body, FormData):
                    value = received_body.getlist(field.alias)
                else:
                    value = received_body.get(field.alias)
            
            if value is None or (
                value == "" and isinstance(field_info, params.Form)
            ) or (
                field.shape in sequence_shapes
                and len(value) == 0
                and isinstance(field_info, params.Form)
            ):
                if field.required:
                    errors.append(ErrorWrapper(MissingError(), loc=("body", field.alias))
                else:
                    values[field.name] = deepcopy(field.default)
            else:
                if isinstance(field_info, params.File) and lenient_issubclass(field.type_, bytes) and isinstance(value, UploadFile):
                    value = await value.read()
                elif field.shape in sequence_shapes and isinstance(field_info, params.File) and lenient_issubclass(field.type_, bytes) and isinstance(value, sequence_types):
                    awaitables = [sub_value.read() for sub_value in value]
                    contents = await asyncio.gather(*awaitables)
                    value = sequence_shape_to_type[field.shape](contents)
    
                v_, errors_ = field.validate(value, values, loc=("body", field.alias))
                if isinstance(errors_, ErrorWrapper):
                    errors.append(errors_)
                elif isinstance(errors_, list):
                    errors.extend(errors_)
                else:
                    values[field.name] = v_
                
    return values, errors
```

### Summary
The corrected version of the function now properly handles repeated keys in form data entries by capturing them in a list format when needed. This adjustment aligns with the expected behavior outlined in the GitHub issue, ensuring that all values are correctly processed and validated.
