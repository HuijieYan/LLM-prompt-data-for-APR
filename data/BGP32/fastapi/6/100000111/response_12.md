The bug in the provided function `request_body_to_args` stems from the misinterpretation of parsing repeated key-value pairs in form data. The function fails to correctly handle multiple values associated with the same key, leading to only the last value being considered.

To address this issue and align the function with the expected input/output values and resolutions for the GitHub issue, the following steps should be taken:

1. Update the logic in the function to properly handle repeated keys in form data.
2. Ensure that all key-value pairs are captured and processed as lists for the same key before validation.
3. Adjust the approach for extracting and validating values to handle multiple values correctly.

Here is the corrected version of the `request_body_to_args` function:

```python
async def request_body_to_args(
    required_params: List[ModelField],
    received_body: Optional[Union[Dict[str, Any], FormData]],
) -> Tuple[Dict[str, Any], List[ErrorWrapper]]:
    values = {}
    errors = []
    
    if received_body is not None:
        for field in required_params:
            field_name = field.alias
            values[field.name] = received_body.getlist(field_name)
            
            if field.required and not values[field.name]:
                errors.append(ErrorWrapper(MissingError(), loc=("body", field_name)))
                
            for idx, value in enumerate(values[field.name]):
                v_, errors_ = field.validate(value, values, loc=("body", f"{field_name}[{idx}]"))
                
                if isinstance(errors_, ErrorWrapper):
                    errors.append(errors_)
                elif isinstance(errors_, list):
                    errors.extend(errors_)
                else:
                    values[field.name][idx] = v_
    
    return values, errors
```

This corrected version of the function now correctly processes repeated key-value pairs from form data and ensures that all values associated with the same key are captured as lists. Additionally, it handles the validation of each value individually and appends any errors encountered during validation to the `errors` list.

By incorporating these modifications, the function should now align with the expected input/output values provided, resolve the issue described in the GitHub problem statement, and function correctly in cases where repeated key-value pairs are present in the form data.
