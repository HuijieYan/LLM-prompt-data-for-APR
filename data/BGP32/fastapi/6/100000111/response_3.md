The buggy function `request_body_to_args` is designed to validate and extract values from request bodies based on required parameters. The function seems to have a bug related to handling repeated keys in form data, which aligns with the GitHub issue mentioning the problem with repeated key=value pairs in form data.

### Error Location
The root cause of the bug lies in how the function processes form data with repeated keys. When a field has multiple values with the same key, the function currently only considers the last value instead of collecting all values.

### Bug Cause
The bug occurs because the function does not correctly handle repeated keys in form data when iterating over the required parameters, which results in only the last value being extracted for a field instead of all values.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, the function needs to be modified to collect and store all values associated with a repeated key in a list before validation. This adjustment will ensure that all values are considered during the validation process.

### Corrected Version of the Function
```python
async def request_body_to_args(
    required_params: List[ModelField],
    received_body: Optional[Union[Dict[str, Any], FormData]],
) -> Tuple[Dict[str, Any], List[ErrorWrapper]]:
    values = {}
    errors = []
    
    if required_params and isinstance(received_body, FormData):
        for field in required_params:
            value: Any = None
            alias = field.alias
            values[alias] = []
            
            for key, val in received_body.items():
                if key == alias:
                    values[alias].append(val)
            
            if not values[alias]:
                if field.required:
                    errors.append(ErrorWrapper(MissingError(), loc=("body", alias)))
                else:
                    values[alias] = deepcopy(field.default)
            else:
                if len(values[alias]) == 1:
                    values[alias] = values[alias][0]
                else:
                    v_, errors_ = field.validate(values[alias], values, loc=("body", alias))
                    if isinstance(errors_, ErrorWrapper):
                        errors.append(errors_)
                    elif isinstance(errors_, list):
                        errors.extend(errors_)
                    else:
                        values[field.name] = v_
    
    return values, errors
```

In the corrected version of the function:
- Repeated keys in the form data are collected and stored in a list for each corresponding field.
- The collected values for a field are then validated using Pydantic's validation and error reporting mechanisms.
- The function now correctly handles form data with repeated keys and ensures all values are considered during validation.

By incorporating these changes, the corrected function should now be able to appropriately handle and validate form data with repeated keys as described in the GitHub issue.
