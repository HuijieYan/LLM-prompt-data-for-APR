### Analysis
The buggy function `request_body_to_args` is responsible for extracting values from the received body and mapping them to the required parameters. The issue reported on GitHub suggests that the function should handle repeated keys in form data correctly and validate against all values rather than just the last one.

### Identified Issues
1. The function currently only extracts a single value for a parameter, which may not be suitable when dealing with repeated keys.
2. The logic to handle sequence shapes and specific field types like File is present but needs to consider repeated keys as well.
3. The validation and error handling logic may not be correctly capturing errors for missing input values or incorrect types.

### Bug Cause
The bug stems from the assumption that each field will have a single value in the received body, leading to the incorrect handling of repeated keys. This results in only the last value being processed for each field.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to modify the function to handle repeated keys properly, allowing multiple values to be considered for a single field. This adjustment should align with the expected behavior as described in the GitHub issue.

### Code Fix
Here is the corrected version of the `request_body_to_args` function:

```python
async def request_body_to_args(
    required_params: List[ModelField],
    received_body: Optional[Union[Dict[str, Any], FormData]],
) -> Tuple[Dict[str, Any], List[ErrorWrapper]]:
    values = {}
    errors = []
    for field in required_params:
        value = None
        if received_body is not None:
            if field.shape in sequence_shapes and isinstance(received_body, FormData):
                if field.alias in received_body.keys():
                    if field.shape == 1:  # List
                        value = received_body.getlist(field.alias)
                    elif field.shape == 2:  # Set
                        value = set(received_body.getlist(field.alias))
                    elif field.shape == 3:  # Tuple
                        value = tuple(received_body.getlist(field.alias))
                else:
                    value = None
            else:
                value = received_body.get(field.alias)

        if (
            value is None
            or (isinstance(get_field_info(field), params.Form) and value == "")
            or (
                isinstance(get_field_info(field), params.Form)
                and field.shape in sequence_shapes
                and len(value) == 0
            )
        ):
            if field.required:
                if PYDANTIC_1:
                    errors.append(ErrorWrapper(MissingError(), loc=("body", field.alias)))
                else:  # pragma: nocover
                    errors.append(
                        ErrorWrapper(  # type: ignore
                            MissingError(), loc=("body", field.alias), config=BaseConfig
                        )
                    )
            else:
                values[field.name] = deepcopy(field.default)
            continue

        v_, errors_ = field.validate(value, values, loc=("body", field.alias))
        if isinstance(errors_, ErrorWrapper):
            errors.append(errors_)
        elif isinstance(errors_, list):
            errors.extend(errors_)
        else:
            values[field.name] = v_

    return values, errors
```

This corrected version of the function now handles repeated keys in form data for different shapes (list, set, tuple). It extracts all values associated with the same key and processes them according to the specified shape type. The function also ensures that input validation and error handling work correctly for all values.
