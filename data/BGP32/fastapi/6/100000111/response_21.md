The buggy function `request_body_to_args` is supposed to convert request body data into arguments for a FastAPI endpoint. The function is designed to handle different types of request body data and map them to corresponding model fields. The bug seems to be related to processing repeated keys in form data, as described in the GitHub issue.

### Error Locations:
1. The condition `len(required_params) == 1 and not embed` seems incorrectly handling the case of multiple keys with the same name.
2. The logic for handling sequence shapes and form data might be leading to incorrect value extraction in some cases specifically with repeated keys.

### Bug Cause:
The bug seems to arise from how the function processes form data with repeated keys. If form data contains multiple identical keys, the function might not be correctly converting them into a list, resulting in only the last value being captured for the key.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, a check needs to be added to correctly handle repeated keys in form data. When multiple keys with the same name are encountered, their values should be combined into a list before further processing.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
async def request_body_to_args(
    required_params: List[ModelField],
    received_body: Optional[Union[Dict[str, Any], FormData]],
) -> Tuple[Dict[str, Any], List[ErrorWrapper]]:
    values = {}
    errors = []
    if required_params:
        for field in required_params:
            values[field.name] = None
            field_info = get_field_info(field)
            if received_body is not None:
                if field.shape in sequence_shapes and isinstance(received_body, FormData):
                    value = received_body.getlist(field.alias)
                else:
                    raw_value = received_body.get(field.alias)
                    # Handling potential repeated keys in form data
                    if field.shape in sequence_shapes and isinstance(raw_value, list):
                        value = raw_value
                    else:
                        value = [raw_value]

                if value:
                    if field.shape in sequence_shapes:
                        values[field.name] = sequence_shape_to_type[field.shape](value)
                    else:
                        if isinstance(field_info, params.File) and lenient_issubclass(field.type_, bytes):
                            if isinstance(value, UploadFile):
                                value = await value.read()
                        v_, errors_ = field.validate(value, values, loc=("body", field.alias))
                        if isinstance(errors_, ErrorWrapper):
                            errors.append(errors_)
                        elif isinstance(errors_, list):
                            errors.extend(errors_)
                        else:
                            values[field.name] = v_
                elif field.required:
                    errors.append(ErrorWrapper(MissingError(), loc=("body", field.alias)))

    return values, errors
```

This corrected version of the function includes a modification to correctly handle repeated keys in form data by converting their values into a list before processing. This adjustment should address the issue described in the GitHub problem statement.
