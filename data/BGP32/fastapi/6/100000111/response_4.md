The buggy function `request_body_to_args` is intended to convert the received body into arguments based on required parameters. The function has a bug related to handling sequences of values for the same key in the `FormData` input. When multiple values exist for the same key, the function should handle and convert them into lists, sets, or tuples according to the specified field type.

The bug arises from not correctly processing repeated keys in the `FormData`. The function only considers the last value for a key, leading to incorrect results when multiple values exist. To address this issue, we need to modify the function to handle repeated keys and convert them into the appropriate data structure based on the field type.

To fix the bug, we can implement the following strategy:
1. Check if the received body is a `FormData` instance and handle repeated keys appropriately.
2. Convert repeated keys into lists, sets, or tuples based on the field type.
3. Update the value assignment process to account for the converted values from repeated keys.
4. Ensure that the final values are correctly populated and handle any errors during the validation process.

Here is the corrected version of the `request_body_to_args` function:

```python
async def request_body_to_args(
    required_params: List[ModelField],
    received_body: Optional[Union[Dict[str, Any], FormData]],
) -> Tuple[Dict[str, Any], List[ErrorWrapper]]:
    values = {}
    errors = []
    sequence_shapes = {list, set, tuple}
    
    if received_body:
        for field in required_params:
            value: Any = None
            if received_body is not None:
                if field.shape in sequence_shapes and isinstance(received_body, FormData):
                    values_list = received_body.getlist(field.alias)
                    if field.type_ is list:
                        value = values_list
                    elif field.type_ is set:
                        value = set(values_list)
                    elif field.type_ is tuple:
                        value = tuple(values_list)
                else:
                    value = received_body.get(field.alias)
                    
            if value is None or (isinstance(field_info, params.Form) and value == ""):
                if field.required:
                    errors.append(ErrorWrapper(MissingError(), loc=("body", field.alias)))
                else:
                    values[field.name] = deepcopy(field.default)
            else:
                if isinstance(field_info, params.File) and lenient_issubclass(field.type_, bytes) and isinstance(value, UploadFile):
                    value = await value.read()
                v_, errors_ = field.validate(value, values, loc=("body", field.alias))
                if isinstance(errors_, ErrorWrapper):
                    errors.append(errors_)
                elif isinstance(errors_, list):
                    errors.extend(errors_)
                else:
                    values[field.name] = v_
    
    return values, errors
```

This corrected version incorporates handling repeated keys in the `FormData` input and converts them into lists, sets, or tuples based on the field type. It ensures that all values are correctly processed and validated according to the specified parameters. This should address the issue raised in the GitHub report and provide the expected results for the test cases.
