## Analysis:
The error messages indicate that the response status codes are not as expected (422 instead of 200) in all three failing tests related to Python list, set, and tuple parameters being passed as form data.

## Potential Error locations:
1. The `if field.shape in sequence_shapes and isinstance(received_body, FormData):` condition might not be handling the sequence type fields correctly.
2. The method of handling sequence shapes like lists, sets, and tuples may not be properly implemented in the function.

## Cause of the bug:
The bug seems to be related to how the function handles requests where parameters are lists, sets, or tuples, and extracts these values from the form data. The condition for handling sequence shapes might not be properly implemented. This leads to incorrect checking of values and eventually results in the response status code being 422 instead of 200.

## Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the function correctly handles sequence shapes when extracting values from form data. We should ensure that the values are extracted and validated properly based on the field type and shape.

## Corrected Version of the Function:
Here is the corrected version of the `request_body_to_args` function:
```python
async def request_body_to_args(required_params: List[ModelField], received_body: Optional[Union[Dict[str, Any], FormData]]) -> Tuple[Dict[str, Any], List[ErrorWrapper]]:
    values = {}
    errors = []
    for field in required_params:
        value: Any = None
        if received_body is not None:
            if field.shape in sequence_shapes and isinstance(received_body, FormData):
                if field.alias in received_body:
                    value = received_body.getlist(field.alias) if field.shape != set else set(received_body.getlist(field.alias))
            else:
                value = received_body.get(field.alias)
                
        if value is None or (isinstance(get_field_info(field), params.Form) and value == "") or (isinstance(get_field_info(field), params.Form) and field.shape in sequence_shapes and len(value) == 0):
            if field.required:
                if PYDANTIC_1:
                    errors.append(ErrorWrapper(MissingError(), loc=("body", field.alias))
                else:
                    errors.append(ErrorWrapper(MissingError(), loc=("body", field.alias), config=BaseConfig))

            else:
                values[field.name] = deepcopy(field.default)
            continue

        v_, errors_ = field.validate(value, values, loc=("body", field.alias))
        
        if isinstance(errors_, ErrorWrapper):
            errors.append(errors_)
        elif isinstance(errors_, list):
            errors.extend(errors_)
        else:
            values[field.name] = v_
    return values, errors
```

In the corrected version, the function now properly checks if a field is in the received body before extracting its value for the sequence shapes. It handles sequence shapes like lists and sets correctly and validates the extracted values accordingly.

This corrected version should resolve the issue and pass the failing tests related to Python list, set, and tuple parameters being passed as form data.
