## Analysis:
- The function `request_body_to_args` is designed to convert the content of a request body into dictionary values and corresponding error messages for validation.
- The errors in the failing tests suggest that the function is not handling the sequence shapes correctly, leading to a validation error response code of 422 instead of the expected 200.

## Identified Issue:
- The issue lies in the handling of sequence shapes within the function. When the content of the request body represents a sequence shape (list, set, tuple), the function fails to parse this correctly, resulting in validation errors.

## Bug Cause:
- The bug is caused by the incorrect handling of sequence shapes in the `value` assignment part of the function. The function does not properly extract and validate values when dealing with sequence shapes in the request body.

## Fix Strategy:
1. Identify the correct way to extract sequence values from the request body for different sequence shapes.
2. Ensure that the extracted values are properly validated and processed according to the requirements of the `required_params` list.
3. Update the function logic to appropriately handle sequence shapes when extracting and validating values from the request body.

## Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
async def request_body_to_args(
    required_params: List[ModelField],
    received_body: Optional[Union[Dict[str, Any], FormData]],
) -> Tuple[Dict[str, Any], List[ErrorWrapper]]:
    values = {}
    errors = []
    sequence_shapes = {"list", "set", "tuple"}
    for field in required_params:
        value: Any = None
        if received_body is not None:
            if (
                field.shape in sequence_shapes
                and field.alias in received_body
            ):
                value = received_body[field.alias]
            else:
                value = received_body.get(field.alias)
        if value is None:
            if field.required:
                errors.append(
                    ErrorWrapper(MissingError(), loc=("body", field.alias))
                )
            else:
                values[field.name] = deepcopy(field.default)
            continue
        v_, errors_ = field.validate(value, values, loc=("body", field.alias))
        if isinstance(errors_, ErrorWrapper):
            errors.append(errors_)
        elif isinstance(errors_, list):
            errors.extend(errors_)
        else:
            values[field.name] = v_
    return values, errors
```

In the corrected version, the function now correctly handles the extraction and validation of sequence shape values from the request body, ensuring that the values are processed as expected for the required parameters.
