### Analysis:
The buggy function `request_body_to_args` is responsible for extracting values from the received body based on the required parameters. It then validates and stores these values. The error messages indicate that the response status code is expected to be 200, but the actual response status code is 422.

### Potential Error Locations:
1. Issue with extracting values from the received body.
2. Validation of the extracted values against the required parameters.
3. Error handling for missing or invalid values.

### Cause of the Bug:
The bug is likely related to how the function handles non-typing sequences (lists, tuples, sets) in the received data. The function may fail to properly handle and validate these non-typing sequences, leading to a 422 status code response.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
1. Ensure that non-typing sequences are handled correctly when extracting values from the received body.
2. Improve the validation process to correctly handle non-typing sequences in the required parameters.
3. Update error handling to properly manage missing or invalid values in non-typing sequences.

### Corrected Version:
Here is the corrected version of the `request_body_to_args` function that addresses the issues related to non-typing sequences:

```python
async def request_body_to_args(
    required_params: List[ModelField],
    received_body: Optional[Union[Dict[str, Any], FormData]],
) -> Tuple[Dict[str, Any], List[ErrorWrapper]]:
    values = {}
    errors = []
    
    for field in required_params:
        value: Any = None
        
        if received_body is not None:
            if field.shape in sequence_shapes and isinstance(received_body, FormData):
                value = received_body.getlist(field.alias)
            else:
                value = received_body.get(field.alias)

        if value is None:
            if field.required:
                errors.append(
                    ErrorWrapper(MissingError(), loc=("body", field.alias))
                )
            else:
                values[field.name] = deepcopy(field.default)
        else:
            if isinstance(field_info, params.File) and lenient_issubclass(field.type_, bytes):
                if isinstance(value, UploadFile):
                    value = await value.read()
                elif isinstance(value, sequence_types):
                    awaitables = [sub_value.read() for sub_value in value]
                    contents = await asyncio.gather(*awaitables)
                    value = sequence_shape_to_type[field.shape](contents)
            
            v_, errors_ = field.validate(value, values, loc=("body", field.alias))
            if isinstance(errors_, ErrorWrapper):
                errors.append(errors_)
            elif isinstance(errors_, list):
                errors.extend(errors_)
            else:
                values[field.name] = v_
    
    return values, errors
```

By ensuring that the non-typing sequences are correctly handled during extraction and validation stages, this corrected version should address the issue causing the 422 status code responses.
