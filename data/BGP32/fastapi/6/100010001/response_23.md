#### Analysis:
1. The function `request_body_to_args` is responsible for extracting values from the received body (either dict or FormData) based on the required_params (list of ModelField).
2. The key areas of interest for potential errors are the handling of sequences, missing values, and validation checks.
3. The failing tests are asserting for a status code of 200 but getting a status code of 422, indicating a validation error is occurring while processing the received data.
4. The failing tests suggest that the error might be related to processing lists, sets, or tuples in the received body.

#### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Identify the data structure (list, set, tuple) causing the issue.
2. Ensure that the function properly processes sequence data structures in the received body.
3. Handle sequence shapes appropriately based on the provided required params.
4. Check for missing values and validate the extracted values correctly.

#### Corrected Function:
```python
async def request_body_to_args(
    required_params: List[ModelField],
    received_body: Optional[Union[Dict[str, Any], FormData]],
) -> Tuple[Dict[str, Any], List[ErrorWrapper]]:
    values = {}
    errors = []
    
    sequence_shapes = {params.Form, params.Query}
    
    for field in required_params:
        value: Any = None
        
        if received_body is not None:
            if field.shape in sequence_shapes and isinstance(received_body, FormData):
                value = received_body.getlist(field.alias)
            else:
                value = received_body.get(field.alias)
        
        if (
            value is None
            or (isinstance(field.info, params.Form) and value == "")
            or (
                isinstance(field.info, params.Form)
                and field.shape in sequence_shapes
                and len(value) == 0
            )
        ):
            if field.required:
                errors.append(
                    ErrorWrapper(MissingError(), loc=("body", field.alias))
                )
                # For required fields, append missing error
            else:
                values[field.name] = deepcopy(field.default)
                # For non-required fields, use the default value
                
        v_, errors_ = field.validate(value, values, loc=("body", field.alias))
        if isinstance(errors_, ErrorWrapper):
            errors.append(errors_)
        elif isinstance(errors_, list):
            errors.extend(errors_)
        else:
            values[field.name] = v_
    
    return values, errors
```

#### Changes Made:
1. Iterating over each field in the required params list to process individually.
2. Updated the logic for retrieving values from the received_body based on sequence_shapes and FormData.
3. Included correct handling for missing values and default values.
4. Validated the extracted value against the field's validate method.
5. Ensure correct assignment of values to the respective field name.

By applying these corrections in the `request_body_to_args` function, the issues related to processing sequences in the received body should be resolved, and the corrected version should pass the failing tests.
