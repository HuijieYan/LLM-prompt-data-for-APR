### Analysis:
The buggy function `request_body_to_args` is responsible for extracting values from a `received_body` and validating them against a list of `required_params`. The error message in the failing test suggests that the validation is failing with a `422` status code, indicating a validation error.

### Potential Error Locations:
1. The handling of sequence shapes and types may impact the extraction and validation process for form data.
2. Validation checks for required fields and default values might be leading to incorrect handling of the received data.
3. The use of `lenient_issubclass` and `isinstance` checks for file uploads could potentially lead to issues.

### Cause of the Bug:
The bug in the function lies in the handling of sequence shapes and types when processing form data. It might not correctly extract and validate the values from the form data list passed.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the function correctly processes form data, especially for non-typing sequences like lists, sets, and tuples. We should also ensure that required fields are validated properly and that the default values are handled appropriately.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
async def request_body_to_args(
    required_params: List[ModelField],
    received_body: Optional[Union[Dict[str, Any], FormData]],
) -> Tuple[Dict[str, Any], List[ErrorWrapper]]:
    values = {}
    errors = []
    for field in required_params:
        value: Any = None
        if received_body is not None:
            if field.shape in sequence_shapes and isinstance(received_body, FormData):
                value = received_body.getlist(field.alias)
            else:
                value = received_body.get(field.alias)
        if value is None:
            if field.required:
                errors.append(ErrorWrapper(MissingError(), loc=("body", field.alias)))
            else:
                values[field.name] = deepcopy(field.default)
        else:
            if (
                isinstance(field_info, params.File)
                and lenient_issubclass(field.type_, bytes)
                and isinstance(value, list)
            ):
                awaitables = [field_info.sub_fields[0].validateAsync(val) for val in value]
                v = []
                for awaitable in awaitables:
                    v.append(await awaitable)
                value = v
            else:
                v, e = field.validate(value, values, loc=("body", field.alias))
                if isinstance(e, ErrorWrapper):
                    errors.append(e)
                elif isinstance(e, list):
                    errors.extend(e)
                else:
                    values[field.name] = v
    return values, errors
```

This corrected version simplifies the extraction and validation logic, especially for handling non-typing sequences like lists, sets, and tuples. It correctly validates required fields and handles default values as needed, addressing the potential issues seen in the buggy function.
