### Analysis:
The buggy function `request_body_to_args` is responsible for extracting values from a request body based on the required parameters provided. The error messages from the failing tests indicate that the values are not being extracted correctly from the request body, leading to status code 422 (Unprocessable Entity) instead of the expected 200 (OK).

### Potential Error Locations:
1. Extracting values from the request body.
2. Checking for empty values and setting default values.
3. Validating the extracted values.

### Bug Cause:
The bug might be caused by the way values are being extracted from the request body, especially in cases where the field shape is part of a sequence like a list, set, or tuple. The setValue function is not handling these scenarios correctly, leading to validation errors.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
1. Check for field shapes that are part of a sequence (list, set, tuple).
2. Extract values accordingly for sequence-shaped fields.
3. Handle empty values properly based on field requirements.
4. Validate the extracted values before setting them.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
async def request_body_to_args(
    required_params: List[ModelField],
    received_body: Optional[Union[Dict[str, Any], FormData]],
) -> Tuple[Dict[str, Any], List[ErrorWrapper]]:
    values = {}
    errors = []
    if required_params:
        for field in required_params:
            field_info = get_field_info(field)
            value: Any = None
            if received_body is not None:
                if field.shape in sequence_shapes and isinstance(
                    received_body, FormData
                ):
                    value = received_body.getlist(field.alias)
                else:
                    value = received_body.get(field.alias)
            if value is None:
                if field.required:
                    errors.append(ErrorWrapper(MissingError(), loc=("body", field.alias)))
                else:
                    values[field.name] = deepcopy(field.default)
            else:
                if field.shape in sequence_shapes:
                    if not isinstance(value, list):
                        errors.append(ErrorWrapper(ValueError("Invalid value for sequence-shaped field"), loc=("body", field.alias)))
                    else:
                        value = [await field.validate(v, values, loc=("body", field.alias)) for v in value]
                else:
                    v_, errors_ = field.validate(value, values, loc=("body", field.alias))
                    if isinstance(errors_, ErrorWrapper):
                        errors.append(errors_)
                    elif isinstance(errors_, list):
                        errors.extend(errors_)
                    else:
                        values[field.name] = v_
    return values, errors
```

In the corrected version, extracted values from the request body are handled based on the field shape, especially when dealing with sequence-shaped fields like lists, sets, and tuples. Proper validation is performed on the extracted values before setting them into the result dictionary.

This corrected version should resolve the issue and allow the tests to pass with the expected status code 200.
