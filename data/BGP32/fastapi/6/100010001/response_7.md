### Analysis:
The `request_body_to_args` function is responsible for parsing the received body data and extracting values for the required parameters. The error message indicates that the response status code is expected to be 200 but is returning 422 instead, which signifies a validation error. This suggests that there may be an issue with how the function is handling the received data and validating it against the required parameters.

### Potential Error Location:
- The handling of sequences in the received body data might be causing the issue.
- The validation process for each field might not be working correctly.
- The check for required fields and default values might be incorrect.

### Bug Explanation:
1. The function is designed to handle form data from requests and validate it against the required parameters. If the received data for a field does not match the expected format, it might lead to validation errors.
2. When dealing with non-typing sequences like lists, sets, or tuples, the function may not be correctly extracting and validating the values from the form data.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Ensure that the function correctly handles the parsing and validation of data for non-typing sequences like lists, sets, and tuples.
2. Check the validation process for required fields, default values, and validation errors for each field.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
async def request_body_to_args(
    required_params: List[ModelField],
    received_body: Optional[Union[Dict[str, Any], FormData]],
) -> Tuple[Dict[str, Any], List[ErrorWrapper]]:
    values = {}
    errors = []
    if required_params:
        for field in required_params:
            value: Any = None
            if received_body is not None:
                # Get the value from the received body
                value = received_body.get(field.alias)
                if value is None and field.required:
                    errors.append(ErrorWrapper(MissingError(), loc=("body", field.alias)))
                elif value is not None:
                    v_, errors_ = field.validate(value, values, loc=("body", field.alias))
                    if isinstance(errors_, ErrorWrapper):
                        errors.append(errors_)
                    elif isinstance(errors_, list):
                        errors.extend(errors_)
                    else:
                        values[field.name] = v_

    return values, errors
```

In the corrected version of the function, the values are correctly extracted from the received body data for each required parameter. The validation process is streamlined to handle the required fields, missing values, and validation errors. This revised version should pass the failing tests.
