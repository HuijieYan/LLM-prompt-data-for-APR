### Analysis:
The error messages indicate that the tests are failing due to a validation error returning a `422` status code instead of `200`. This suggests that the function `request_body_to_args` is encountering issues while processing and validating the request body parameters.

### Potential Error Location:
1. Processing sequence-shaped fields from the request body may not be handled correctly.
2. Validation errors or handling of missing values might not align with the expected behavior.
3. The logic for handling different types of field shapes (like File) from the request body may have issues.

### Bug Cause:
The function `request_body_to_args` is not correctly handling sequence-shaped fields (such as lists, sets, tuples) from the request body. As a result, it fails to properly process and validate these parameters, leading to the validation errors and status code `422`.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
1. Update the logic for processing sequence-shaped fields from the request body.
2. Ensure that missing values are handled appropriately based on the required status.
3. Modify the logic for handling different field types (like File) to prevent validation errors and incorrect status codes.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
async def request_body_to_args(
    required_params: List[ModelField],
    received_body: Optional[Union[Dict[str, Any], FormData]],
) -> Tuple[Dict[str, Any], List[ErrorWrapper]]:
    values = {}
    errors = []
    for field in required_params:
        alias = field.alias
        field_value = None
        if received_body is not None:
            if field.shape in sequence_shapes and isinstance(received_body, FormData):
                field_value = received_body.getlist(alias)
            else:
                field_value = received_body.get(alias)
        if field_value is None or (isinstance(field, ModelField) and field_value == ""):
            if field.required:
                errors.append(
                    ErrorWrapper(MissingError(), loc=("body", alias))
                )
            else:
                values[field.name] = deepcopy(field.default)
        else:
            v_, errors_ = await field.validate_assignment(field_value, values, loc=("body", alias))
            if isinstance(errors_, ErrorWrapper):
                errors.append(errors_)
            elif isinstance(errors_, list):
                errors.extend(errors_)
            else:
                values[field.name] = v_
    return values, errors
```

### Changes Made:
1. Corrected the handling of sequence-shaped fields by simplifying the logic for fetching values.
2. Fixed the error handling for missing values based on field requirements.
3. Changed the validation process for the field to `await field.validate_assignment` to correctly handle the validation.
4. Removed unnecessary condition checks and adjusted variable names for clarity.

After applying these corrections, the function should be able to process and validate the request body parameters correctly, resolving the validation errors that led to the failing tests.
