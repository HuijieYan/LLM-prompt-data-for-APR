### Analysis:
The error messages indicate that the response status code is not what is expected (422 instead of 200). This discrepancy suggests that there is an issue with how the data is processed in the `request_body_to_args` function, leading to incorrect validation and potentially an error in parsing input data, especially for non-typing sequences like lists, sets, and tuples.

### Bug Identification:
1. The function applies different logic based on the shape of the field and the type of data passed, leading to potential misinterpretation of values.
2. The handling of sequence shapes for input data such as lists, sets, and tuples seems to be incorrect, possibly resulting in values not being extracted correctly from the request body.

### Bug Cause:
The function in its current state struggles to correctly process and validate input data when dealing with non-typing sequences like lists, sets, and tuples. This causes incorrect extraction and validation of values, leading to the response status code being 422 instead of the expected 200.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Update the logic for handling sequence shapes in input data to ensure that values are correctly extracted and processed for non-typing sequences such as lists, sets, and tuples.
2. Ensure that the validation process is accurate for all types of input data, as per the requirements of FastAPI request handling.

### Bug-fixed Code:
```python
async def request_body_to_args(
    required_params: List[ModelField],
    received_body: Optional[Union[Dict[str, Any], FormData]],
) -> Tuple[Dict[str, Any], List[ErrorWrapper]]:
    values = {}
    errors = []
    for field in required_params:
        value = None
        if received_body is not None:
            if field.shape in sequence_shapes and isinstance(received_body, FormData):
                value = received_body.getlist(field.alias)
            else:
                value = received_body.get(field.alias)
        if (
            value is None
            or (isinstance(get_field_info(field), params.Form) and value == "")
            or (
                isinstance(get_field_info(field), params.Form)
                and field.shape in sequence_shapes
                and len(value) == 0
            )
        ):
            if field.required:
                if PYDANTIC_1:
                    errors.append(ErrorWrapper(MissingError(), loc=("body", field.alias)))
                else:
                    errors.append(
                        ErrorWrapper(MissingError(), loc=("body", field.alias), config=BaseConfig)
                    )
            else:
                values[field.name] = deepcopy(field.default)
        else:
            v, err = field.validate(value, values, loc=("body", field.alias))
            if isinstance(err, ErrorWrapper):
                errors.append(err)
            elif isinstance(err, list):
                errors.extend(err)
            else:
                values[field.name] = v
    return values, errors
```

By updating the logic for handling input data sequences and ensuring accurate validation for all types of input data, the corrected version should address the issues leading to the failing tests.
