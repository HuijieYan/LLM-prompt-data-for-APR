### Analysis:
1. The `request_body_to_args` function is designed to process required parameters from the received body.
2. The primary issue causing the failing tests is related to handling non-typed sequence shapes. The current implementation does not correctly handle sequences such as lists, sets, or tuples when passed as form data.
3. The buggy function is not properly checking for sequence shapes and their corresponding values in the received form data, leading to a mismatch between expected and actual status codes in the tests.
4. A strategy to fix the bug involves correctly identifying and processing sequence shapes in the received body, ensuring that the values are properly handled and validated.
  
### Bug Fix:
Here is the corrected version of the `request_body_to_args` function:
```python
async def request_body_to_args(
    required_params: List[ModelField],
    received_body: Optional[Union[Dict[str, Any], FormData]],
) -> Tuple[Dict[str, Any], List[ErrorWrapper]]:
    values = {}
    errors = []
    sequence_shapes = {seq for seq in sequence_shape_to_type.keys()}
    for field in required_params:
        if not isinstance(received_body, FormData) and field.alias not in received_body:
            if field.required:
                errors.append(ErrorWrapper(MissingError(), loc=("body", field.alias)))
            else:
                values[field.alias] = deepcopy(field.default)
        else:
            value = received_body[field.alias]
            if isinstance(value, list) and get_field_info(field).shape in sequence_shapes:
                awaitables = [sub_value.read() for sub_value in value]
                value = sequence_shape_to_type[field.shape](await asyncio.gather(*awaitables))
            elif isinstance(value, UploadFile) and lenient_issubclass(field.type_, bytes):
                value = await value.read()
                
            v_, errors_ = field.validate(value, values, loc=("body", field.alias))
            if isinstance(errors_, ErrorWrapper):
                errors.append(errors_)
            elif isinstance(errors_, list):
                errors.extend(errors_)
            else:
                values[field.alias] = v_

    return values, errors
```

The corrected version addresses the issue by properly handling sequence shapes like lists in the received form data during parameter processing.

By implementing this correction, the function should now be able to correctly extract and process the required parameters from the form data, ensuring correct validation and error handling.
