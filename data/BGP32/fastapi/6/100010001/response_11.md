## Analysis:
The `request_body_to_args` function is responsible for converting the received body data (either a dictionary or FormData) into arguments based on the required parameters provided. The function iterates through the required parameters, extracts the corresponding values from the body data, validates them, and generates any errors encountered during the process.

The issues identified in the function are related to the handling of sequence-shaped fields such as lists, sets, and tuples. The function is not correctly handling these cases, resulting in validation errors and the status code 422 (Unprocessable Entity) being returned instead of the expected status code 200 (OK).

## Potential Error Locations:
1. Handling of sequence shapes within the `request_body_to_args` function.
2. Validation and processing logic for sequence-shaped fields.
3. error case raised by the MissingError wrapper when the required field value is not provided.

## Cause of the Bug:
The cause of the bug lies in the incorrect handling of sequence shapes such as lists, sets, and tuples in the request body processing function. When the function encounters fields of these shapes, it fails to extract and process the values correctly, resulting in missing or incorrectly processed values.

## Suggested Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to update the logic within the `request_body_to_args` function to properly handle sequence-shaped fields in the request body. Specifically, we need to ensure that the correct values are extracted, processed, and validated for each field, including sequence-shaped fields.

## Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
async def request_body_to_args(
    required_params: List[ModelField],
    received_body: Optional[Union[Dict[str, Any], FormData]],
) -> Tuple[Dict[str, Any], List[ErrorWrapper]]:
    values = {}
    errors = []
    for field in required_params:
        value: Any = None
        if received_body is not None:
            if field.shape in sequence_shapes:
                if isinstance(received_body, FormData):
                    value = received_body.getlist(field.alias)
                elif field.alias in received_body:
                    value = received_body[field.alias]
            else:
                value = received_body.get(field.alias)
        if value is None:
            if field.required:
                errors.append(ErrorWrapper(MissingError(), loc=("body", field.alias)))
            else:
                values[field.name] = deepcopy(field.default)
        else:
            v_, errors_ = await field.validate(value, values, loc=("body", field.alias))
            if isinstance(errors_, ErrorWrapper):
                errors.append(errors_)
            elif isinstance(errors_, list):
                errors.extend(errors_)
            else:
                values[field.alias] = v_
    return values, errors
```

## Changes Made:
1. Removed unnecessary assignments and conditions.
2. Updated the logic for extracting values from the request body based on the field shape.
3. Correctly validated and processed the values for each field.
4. Updated the assignment of values to the correct key in the values dictionary.

By making these changes, the corrected version of the `request_body_to_args` function should be able to handle sequence-shaped fields in the request body correctly and pass the failing tests.
