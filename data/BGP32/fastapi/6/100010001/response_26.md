## Analysis:
1. The error messages indicate that the response status codes are expected to be 200 but are instead returning 422.
2. The test cases involve posting data with "items" field containing a list, set, or tuple.
3. The request_body_to_args function processes the received data from the form but has issues handling sequence data types like lists, sets, and tuples.

## Bugs:
1. The function is not dealing with sequence shapes like lists, sets, and tuples correctly when parsing the received form data.
2. For lists, sets, and tuples, the function needs to handle the case where the field shape is in sequence_shapes but the received data is a FormData object (which happens when the field shape is a sequence but the form field is not treated as a sequence).

## Strategy for fixing the bug:
1. Capture the special cases for handling lists, sets, and tuples when the form data is received.
2. Check if the field shape is in sequence_shapes and the received data is a FormData object, then process the data accordingly.
3. Update the logic for extracting values and handling errors to accommodate the special cases for sequence data types in the form.

## Corrected Version:
```python
async def request_body_to_args(
    required_params: List[ModelField],
    received_body: Optional[Union[Dict[str, Any], FormData]],
) -> Tuple[Dict[str, Any], List[ErrorWrapper]]:
    values = {}
    errors = []
    if required_params:
        if received_body is not None and isinstance(received_body, FormData):
            received_body = dict(received_body)

        for field in required_params:
            value: Any = None
            if received_body is not None:
                if field.shape in sequence_shapes and isinstance(received_body, FormData):
                    if field.alias in received_body:
                        value = received_body.getlist(field.alias)
                    else:
                        continue  # Field not found in form, skip it
                else:
                    value = received_body.get(field.alias)

            if (
                value is None
                or (isinstance(field_info, params.Form) and value == "")
                or (
                    isinstance(field_info, params.Form)
                    and field.shape in sequence_shapes
                    and len(value) == 0
                )
            ):
                if field.required:
                    if PYDANTIC_1:
                        errors.append(
                            ErrorWrapper(MissingError(), loc=("body", field.alias))
                        )
                    else:  # pragma: nocover
                        errors.append(
                            ErrorWrapper(
                                MissingError(), loc=("body", field.alias), config=BaseConfig
                            )
                        )
                else:
                    values[field.name] = deepcopy(field.default)
                continue

            if (
                isinstance(field_info, params.File)
                and lenient_issubclass(field.type_, bytes)
                and isinstance(value, UploadFile)
            ):
                value = await value.read()
            elif (
                field.shape in sequence_shapes
                and isinstance(field_info, params.File)
                and lenient_issubclass(field.type_, bytes)
                and isinstance(value, sequence_types)
            ):
                awaitables = [sub_value.read() for sub_value in value]
                contents = await asyncio.gather(*awaitables)
                value = sequence_shape_to_type[field.shape](contents)

            v_, errors_ = field.validate(value, values, loc=("body", field.alias))
            if isinstance(errors_, ErrorWrapper):
                errors.append(errors_)
            elif isinstance(errors_, list):
                errors.extend(errors_)
            else:
                values[field.name] = v_

    return values, errors
```

With these corrections, the function should now handle the special cases for lists, sets, and tuples properly when processing form data, resolving the errors in the failing tests.
