### Analysis:
- The function `request_body_to_args` is responsible for converting the received body data into arguments based on the required parameters.
- The function seems to have issues with handling sequence shapes correctly, leading to test failures with status code 422 instead of the expected 200.
- The conditions for dealing with sequence shapes and values within those sequences might not be properly executed in the function.
- The function needs to be modified to correctly handle sequence shapes and ensure that the values are extracted and validated appropriately.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Check the conditions related to sequence shapes and values extraction.
2. Ensure that the logic for handling sequences aligns with the requirements of the test cases.
3. Make necessary adjustments to correctly extract and validate values based on sequence shapes.
4. Fix any potential issues with error generation and appending to the errors list.

### Updated Corrected Function:
```python
async def request_body_to_args(
    required_params: List[ModelField],
    received_body: Optional[Union[Dict[str, Any], FormData]],
) -> Tuple[Dict[str, Any], List[ErrorWrapper]]:
    values = {}
    errors = []
    for field in required_params:
        value = None
        field_info = get_field_info(field)
        if received_body is not None:
            if field.shape in sequence_shapes and isinstance(received_body, FormData):
                if field.alias in received_body:
                    value = received_body.getlist(field.alias)
                else:
                    value = received_body.get(field.alias)
            else:
                value = received_body.get(field.alias)
        if value is None:
            if field.required:
                errors.append(
                    ErrorWrapper(MissingError(), loc=("body", field.alias))
                )
            else:
                values[field.name] = deepcopy(field.default)
            continue
        if (
            isinstance(field_info, params.File)
            and lenient_issubclass(field.type_, bytes)
            and isinstance(value, UploadFile)
        ):
            value = await value.read()
        v_, errors_ = field.validate(value, values, loc=("body", field.alias))
        if isinstance(errors_, ErrorWrapper):
            errors.append(errors_)
        elif isinstance(errors_, list):
            errors.extend(errors_)
        else:
            values[field.name] = v_
    return values, errors
```

By updating the function with the corrected logic for handling sequence shapes and ensuring correct value extraction and validation, the issues related to the failing tests should be resolved.
