The buggy function `request_body_to_args` has multiple issues that need to be addressed:

1. The condition `if len(required_params) == 1 and not embed:` is incorrect and should not be used to modify the `received_body` dictionary. The assumption made here is incorrect.

2. In the case of sequence shapes like lists, sets, or tuples, the `getlist` method should be used with FormData to retrieve multiple values for the same key.

3. There are issues in the handling of sequence types and reading bytes from UploadFile instances.

To fix these issues, a new approach is needed to correctly map the received body to the required parameters.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
async def request_body_to_args(
    required_params: List[ModelField],
    received_body: Optional[Union[Dict[str, Any], FormData]],
) -> Tuple[Dict[str, Any], List[ErrorWrapper]]:
    values = {}
    errors = []
    
    if received_body is not None:
        for field in required_params:
            value: Any = None

            if isinstance(received_body, FormData):
                if field.alias in received_body:
                    if field.shape in sequence_shapes:
                        value = received_body.getlist(field.alias)
                    else:
                        value = received_body[field.alias]

            if value is None or value == "":
                if field.required:
                    errors.append(ErrorWrapper(MissingError(), loc=("body", field.alias)))
                else:
                    values[field.name] = deepcopy(field.default)
            else:
                if isinstance(field_info, params.File) and lenient_issubclass(field.type_, bytes):
                    if isinstance(value, UploadFile):
                        value = await value.read()
                    elif field.shape in sequence_shapes and isinstance(value, sequence_types):
                        awaitables = [sub_value.read() for sub_value in value]
                        contents = await asyncio.gather(*awaitables)
                        value = sequence_shape_to_type[field.shape](contents)
                
                v_, errors_ = field.validate(value, values, loc=("body", field.alias))
                
                if isinstance(errors_, ErrorWrapper):
                    errors.append(errors_)
                elif isinstance(errors_, list):
                    errors.extend(errors_)
                else:
                    values[field.name] = v_
    
    return values, errors
```

This corrected version should now handle the cases of lists, sets, and tuples correctly, ensuring that the values are extracted from the received body and validated accordingly. The function should pass the failing tests provided.
