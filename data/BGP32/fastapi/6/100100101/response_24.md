### Analysis:
The buggy function `request_body_to_args` is designed to handle converting received form data into arguments based on required parameters. The function iterates over each required parameter and extracts the corresponding value from the received body data.

#### Identified issues:
1. The bug lies in the logic where the function tries to handle sequence shapes like lists, sets, or tuples. The code does not correctly handle multiple items with the same key in the received form data, leading to incorrect values being extracted.

### Bug Explanation:
In this case, the buggy function fails to properly handle when the same key appears multiple times in the FormData. For example, in the test cases, the "items" key appears multiple times with different values, but the function incorrectly processes them.

### Strategy for fixing the bug:
To fix the bug, we need to update the logic of handling sequence shapes and iterating over the received body data to correctly process multiple items with the same key.

### Corrected version of the function:
```python
async def request_body_to_args(
    required_params: List[ModelField],
    received_body: Optional[Union[Dict[str, Any], FormData]],
) -> Tuple[Dict[str, Any], List[ErrorWrapper]]:
    values = {}
    errors = []
    for field in required_params:
        value: Any = None
        if received_body is not None:
            if isinstance(received_body, FormData):
                value = received_body.getlist(field.alias)
            else:
                value = [received_body.get(field.alias)]
        if value[0] is None:
            if field.required:
                errors.append(ErrorWrapper(MissingError(), loc=("body", field.alias)))
            else:
                values[field.name] = deepcopy(field.default)
            continue
        if isinstance(field, ModelField) and field.sub_fields:
            # Handle nested models recursively
            v_, errors_ = await request_body_to_args(field.sub_fields, received_body)
        else:
            v_, errors_ = field.validate(value, values, loc=("body", field.alias))
        if isinstance(errors_, ErrorWrapper):
            errors.append(errors_)
        elif isinstance(errors_, list):
            errors.extend(errors_)
        else:
            values[field.name] = v_
    return values, errors
```

This corrected version of the function should now properly parse form data with multiple items for the same key in sequences like lists, sets, and tuples. Run the failing test cases to verify if the corrected function passes the tests.
