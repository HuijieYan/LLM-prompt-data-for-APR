The buggy function `request_body_to_args` seems to have an issue when handling sequence-shaped fields, such as lists, sets, and tuples, from form data. The current implementation is not correctly converting the received data into the expected Python data structures, resulting in errors and incorrect values being stored.

The main issue seems to be in the section where the form data is being processed for sequence-shaped fields. The values are being extracted incorrectly, leading to the incorrect assignment and validation of values.

To fix this issue, we need to properly handle the conversion of form data for sequence-shaped fields and ensure that the values are correctly assigned and validated.

Here is the corrected version of the `request_body_to_args` function:

```python
# The corrected version of the function
async def request_body_to_args(
    required_params: List[ModelField],
    received_body: Optional[Union[Dict[str, Any], FormData]],
) -> Tuple[Dict[str, Any], List[ErrorWrapper]]:
    values = {}
    errors = []
    for field in required_params:
        value: Any = None
        if received_body is not None:
            if field.shape in sequence_shapes and isinstance(received_body, FormData):
                if field.alias in received_body:
                    if field.shape == 2:
                        value = set(received_body[field.alias])
                    elif field.shape == 3:
                        value = tuple(received_body[field.alias])
                    else:
                        value = received_body[field.alias]
            else:
                value = received_body.get(field.alias)

        if value is None or (isinstance(field_info, params.Form) and value == "") or (
            isinstance(field_info, params.Form)
            and field.shape in sequence_shapes
            and len(value) == 0
        ):
            if field.required:
                if PYDANTIC_1:
                    errors.append(ErrorWrapper(MissingError(), loc=("body", field.alias)))
                else:  # pragma: nocover
                    errors.append(
                        ErrorWrapper(
                            MissingError(), loc=("body", field.alias), config=BaseConfig
                        )
                    )
            else:
                values[field.name] = deepcopy(field.default)
            continue

        if (
            isinstance(field_info, params.File)
            and lenient_issubclass(field.type_, bytes)
            and isinstance(value, UploadFile)
        ):
            value = await value.read()
        
        v_, errors_ = field.validate(value, values, loc=("body", field.alias))
        if isinstance(errors_, ErrorWrapper):
            errors.append(errors_)
        elif isinstance(errors_, list):
            errors.extend(errors_)
        else:
            values[field.name] = v_
    
    return values, errors
```

This corrected version includes proper handling for converting form data into Python sequences based on the shape of the field. It addresses the issues related to incorrect value assignment and validation.

Please replace the original buggy function with this corrected version to ensure that it passes the failing tests provided.
