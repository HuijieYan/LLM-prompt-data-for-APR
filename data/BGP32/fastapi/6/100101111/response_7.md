### Bug Explanation

The bug in the `request_body_to_args` function stems from the issue related to handling repeated keys in form data. When receiving form data with repeated keys, only the last key=value pair is considered, leading to incorrect behavior when trying to validate and process the data as a list, set, or tuple. This causes the failing tests to not receive the expected values when processing form data with repeated keys as lists, sets, or tuples.

### Bug Fix Strategy

To fix the bug, we need to modify the logic in the `request_body_to_args` function to correctly handle form data with repeated keys for lists, sets, and tuples. We should collect all values associated with repeated keys before processing them and ensure that the correct data structure is maintained during validation.

### Corrected Version of the Function

Here is the corrected version of the `request_body_to_args` function:

```python
async def request_body_to_args(
    required_params: List[ModelField],
    received_body: Optional[Union[Dict[str, Any], FormData]],
) -> Tuple[Dict[str, Any], List[ErrorWrapper]]:
    values = {}
    errors = []
    
    if received_body:
        values = {field.name: [] for field in required_params}
        
        for field in required_params:
            if received_body is not None:
                if field.shape in sequence_shapes and isinstance(received_body, FormData):
                    values[field.name] = received_body.getlist(field.alias)
                else:
                    values[field.name] = received_body.get(field.alias)
                    
            if values[field.name] is None or (
                isinstance(get_field_info(field), params.Form)
                and values[field.name] == ""
            ):
                if field.required:
                    errors.append(ErrorWrapper(MissingError(), loc=("body", field.alias))
                else:
                    values[field.name] = deepcopy(field.default)
            elif field.shape in sequence_shapes and isinstance(get_field_info(field), params.File):
                awaitables = [value.read() for value in values[field.name]]
                contents = await asyncio.gather(*awaitables)
                values[field.name] = sequence_shape_to_type[field.shape](contents)
    
    return values, errors
```

### Updated Test Cases

The provided corrected version of the function should now correctly handle form data with repeated keys for lists, sets, and tuples. As a result, the failing test cases, `test_python_list_param_as_form`, `test_python_set_param_as_form`, and `test_python_tuple_param_as_form`, should now pass with the corrected function implementation.
