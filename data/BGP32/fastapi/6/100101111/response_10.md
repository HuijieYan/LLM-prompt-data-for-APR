### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `request_body_to_args` is responsible for converting the received body data into arguments based on the required parameters. It currently has issues handling form data with repeated keys, resulting in validation errors.
2. The issue occurs when there are repeated keys in the form data, causing only the last value to be considered instead of collecting all values as a list.
3. The bug is related to how the function processes form data with repeated keys, leading to validation errors and incorrect handling of sequence shapes.
4. To fix the bug, we need to modify the function to correctly handle repeated keys in form data and aggregate them into lists before validation.
5. I will provide a corrected version of the function below.

### Bug Fix:
```python
async def request_body_to_args(
    required_params: List[ModelField],
    received_body: Optional[Union[Dict[str, Any], FormData]],
) -> Tuple[Dict[str, Any], List[ErrorWrapper]]:
    values = {}
    errors = []
    if required_params:
        if received_body is not None and isinstance(received_body, FormData):
            for field in required_params:
                values[field.alias] = received_body.getlist(field.alias)
                value = values.get(field.alias)
                
                field_info = get_field_info(field)
                
                v_, errors_ = field.validate(value, values, loc=("body", field.alias))
                if isinstance(errors_, ErrorWrapper):
                    errors.append(errors_)
                elif isinstance(errors_, list):
                    errors.extend(errors_)
                else:
                    values[field.name] = v_
    return values, errors
```

### Updated function explanation:
1. Iterate over the required parameters and extract the values by using `getlist` to handle repeated keys in form data properly.
2. Validate each extracted value against the field and collect errors if any.
3. Update the `values` dictionary with the validated values.
4. Return the updated `values` and any validation errors.
5. This corrected version should resolve the issue related to repeated keys in form data.
