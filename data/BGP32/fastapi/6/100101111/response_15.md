### Bug Explanation

The bug in the `request_body_to_args` function lies in how it handles repeated keys in the `received_body`, especially when dealing with sequences like lists, sets, and tuples. In the provided runtime input examples, the function fails to handle repeated keys properly, resulting in incorrect validation and consequently the failing tests.

The buggy function fails to correctly handle repeated keys when parsing the `received_body` data. It only takes the last value associated with a repeated key, leading to incomplete or incorrect data processing. This issue is directly related to the GitHub issue mentioned, as it reflects the problem of not supporting repeated key=value pairs in form data.

### Bug Fix Strategy

To fix the bug, the `request_body_to_args` function needs to be modified to handle repeated keys appropriately for sequences like lists, sets, and tuples. When encountering repeated keys, the function should collect all associated values for that key and correctly parse them into the respective Python sequence data structure.

### Corrected Function

Here is the corrected version of the `request_body_to_args` function:

```python
from collections import defaultdict

async def request_body_to_args(
    required_params: List[ModelField],
    received_body: Optional[Union[Dict[str, Any], FormData]],
) -> Tuple[Dict[str, Any], List[ErrorWrapper]]:
    values = {}
    errors = []
    
    if required_params and received_body is not None:
        repeated_keys = defaultdict(list)
        
        # Collect repeated keys data
        for key, value in dict(received_body).items():
            repeated_keys[key].append(value)
        
        for field in required_params:
            value = None
            alias = field.alias
            
            if alias in repeated_keys:
                value = repeated_keys[alias]
            elif alias in received_body:
                value = received_body.get(alias)
                
            if value is None:
                if field.required:
                    errors.append(ErrorWrapper(MissingError(), loc=("body", alias))
                else:
                    values[field.name] = deepcopy(field.default)
                    
            else:
                if isinstance(field_info, params.File) and lenient_issubclass(field.type_, bytes):
                    if isinstance(value, list):
                        value = [await sub_value.read() for sub_value in value]
                    else:
                        value = await value.read()
            
                v_, errors_ = field.validate(value, values, loc=("body", alias))
                
                if isinstance(errors_, ErrorWrapper):
                    errors.append(errors_)
                elif isinstance(errors_, list):
                    errors.extend(errors_)
                else:
                    values[field.name] = v_
    
    return values, errors
```

With this corrected implementation, the function should now properly handle repeated keys and correctly parse them into Python sequences, resolving the issue and enabling the failing tests to pass as expected.
