## Identified Bug
The bug in the `request_body_to_args` function stems from how it processes form data with repeated keys. In cases where the form data contains repeated keys, the function incorrectly handles these keys and only considers the last value, resulting in validation errors during processing. This behavior contradicts the expected functionality where FastAPI should collect repeated keys and assign their values as a list before validation.

## Bug Cause
The bug occurs when checking if the field's shape is in the `sequence_shapes` list and the received body is of type `FormData`. In this specific scenario, the function incorrectly retrieves the value corresponding to the field alias, resulting in only the last value being considered. This behavior leads to validation errors when processing form data with repeated keys.

## Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, the function needs to be modified to correctly handle form data with repeated keys by collecting these values into a list before validation. This adjustment will align the processing behavior with the expected functionality described in the GitHub issue.

## Corrected Function
```python
async def request_body_to_args(
    required_params: List[ModelField],
    received_body: Optional[Union[Dict[str, Any], FormData]],
) -> Tuple[Dict[str, Any], List[ErrorWrapper]]:
    values = {}
    errors = []
    if required_params:
        for field in required_params:
            value: Any = None
            if received_body is not None:
                if field.shape in sequence_shapes and isinstance(
                    received_body, FormData
                ):
                    if field.shape == 1:
                        value = received_body.getlist(field.alias)
                    else:
                        value = [received_body.get(f"{field.alias}[{i}]") for i in range(field.shape)]
                else:
                    value = received_body.get(field.alias)
            if (
                value is None
                or (isinstance(field_info, params.Form) and value == "")
                or (
                    isinstance(field_info, params.Form)
                    and field.shape in sequence_shapes
                    and len(value) == 0
                )
            ):
                if field.required:
                    if PYDANTIC_1:
                        errors.append(
                            ErrorWrapper(MissingError(), loc=("body", field.alias))
                        )
                    else:
                        errors.append(
                            ErrorWrapper(  # type: ignore
                                MissingError(),
                                loc=("body", field.alias),
                                config=BaseConfig,
                            )
                        )
                else:
                    values[field.name] = deepcopy(field.default)
                continue
            if (
                isinstance(field_info, params.File)
                and lenient_issubclass(field.type_, bytes)
                and isinstance(value, UploadFile)
            ):
                value = await value.read()
            v_, errors_ = field.validate(value, values, loc=("body", field.alias))
            if isinstance(errors_, ErrorWrapper):
                errors.append(errors_)
            elif isinstance(errors_, list):
                errors.extend(errors_)
            else:
                values[field.name] = v_
    return values, errors
```

With this correction, the function will now properly handle repeated keys in form data, collect their values into a list based on the field shape, and proceed with the validation process as expected. This fix aligns with the intended functionality outlined in the GitHub issue.
