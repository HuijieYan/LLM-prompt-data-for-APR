### Bug Fix Strategy:
The buggy function `request_body_to_args` currently fails to handle repeated keys in the `FormData`. As observed in the failing tests, when multiple values are associated with the same key, only the last value is considered, leading to validation errors.

To fix this bug:
1. Modify the function to check for multiple values associated with the same key in the `FormData`.
2. Collect all values for each key into a list before performing validation.
3. Update the `values` dictionary to store lists of values for keys with multiple values.

By making these changes, the function will correctly handle repeated keys in the `FormData` and pass the failing tests.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
async def request_body_to_args(
    required_params: List[ModelField],
    received_body: Optional[Union[Dict[str, Any], FormData]],
) -> Tuple[Dict[str, Any], List[ErrorWrapper]]:
    values = {}
    errors = []
    
    if received_body is not None and isinstance(received_body, FormData):
        for field in required_params:
            values_list = received_body.getlist(field.alias)
            
            # If only one value exists for the key, extract the value directly
            if len(values_list) == 1:
                value = values_list[0]
            else:
                value = values_list
                
            if value == "" and isinstance(field_info, params.Form):
                value = None
                
            v_, errors_ = field.validate(value, values, loc=("body", field.alias))
            
            if isinstance(errors_, ErrorWrapper):
                errors.append(errors_)
            elif isinstance(errors_, list):
                errors.extend(errors_)
            else:
                values[field.name] = v_
    
    return values, errors
```

This corrected version of the function updates the logic to check for multiple values associated with the same key in the `FormData`. It collects all values into a list and stores them in the `values` dictionary accordingly. This modification ensures that all values are considered during validation and prevents validation errors when dealing with repeated keys.
