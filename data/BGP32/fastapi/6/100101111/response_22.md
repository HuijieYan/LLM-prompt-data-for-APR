## Bug Explanation
The bug in the `request_body_to_args` function is caused by the incorrect handling of sequence shapes (like lists, sets, and tuples) within form data (`FormData`) when validating fields for FastAPI. The function fails to correctly parse and validate repeated keys with multiple values in form data, leading to incorrect processing and validation of the input.

The validation logic currently in place does not handle cases where the form data contains duplicate keys (like `items`) with multiple values. This results in the function considering only the last value for a key rather than treating multiple values as a list (in the case of lists or tuples) or a set (in the case of a set) for validation purposes.

## Fix Strategy
To address this issue and enable support for repeated key=value pairs in form data, the `request_body_to_args` function needs to be modified to correctly handle cases where a key contains multiple values in form data. Specifically, the function should collect all values corresponding to a repeated key and consider them as a list, set, or tuple (depending on the field type) for validation purposes.

The function must be updated to properly parse and handle sequence shapes in form data, ensuring that all values associated with a key are considered during validation. By modifying the logic to collect and process all values for a repeated key, the function will align with the expected behavior of processing repeated keys as lists, sets, or tuples in the context of FastAPI form data validation.

## Corrected Version
Below is the corrected version of the `request_body_to_args` function that addresses the issue raised in the GitHub bug report and ensures proper handling of repeated key=value pairs in form data:

```python
async def request_body_to_args(
    required_params: List[ModelField],
    received_body: Optional[Union[Dict[str, Any], FormData]],
) -> Tuple[Dict[str, Any], List[ErrorWrapper]]:
    values = {}
    errors = []

    if required_params:
        for field in required_params:
            value: Any = None

            if received_body is not None:
                if field.shape in sequence_shapes and isinstance(
                    received_body, FormData
                ):
                    values_list = received_body.getlist(field.alias)
                    
                    if field.type_ is list:
                        value = values_list
                    elif field.type_ is set:
                        value = set(values_list)
                    elif field.type_ is tuple:
                        value = tuple(values_list)

                else:
                    value = received_body.get(field.alias)

            if (
                value is None
                or (isinstance(field_info, params.Form) and value == "")
                or (
                    isinstance(field_info, params.Form)
                    and field.shape in sequence_shapes
                    and len(value) == 0
                )
            ):
                if field.required:
                    if PYDANTIC_1:
                        errors.append(
                            ErrorWrapper(MissingError(), loc=("body", field.alias))
                        )
                    else:  
                        errors.append(
                            ErrorWrapper(
                                MissingError(),
                                loc=("body", field.alias),
                                config=BaseConfig,
                            )
                        )
                else:
                    values[field.name] = deepcopy(field.default)
                continue

            if (
                isinstance(field_info, params.File)
                and lenient_issubclass(field.type_, bytes)
                and isinstance(value, UploadFile)
            ):
                value = await value.read()

            v_, errors_ = field.validate(value, values, loc=("body", field.alias))

            if isinstance(errors_, ErrorWrapper):
                errors.append(errors_)
            elif isinstance(errors_, list):
                errors.extend(errors_)
            else:
                values[field.name] = v_

    return values, errors
```

By incorporating this corrected logic into the `request_body_to_args` function, the function should now properly handle processing repeated keys with multiple values in form data, ensuring that all values are considered for validation based on the respective field type. This revision aligns with the expected behavior described in the GitHub issue and should resolve the bug causing the failing tests.
