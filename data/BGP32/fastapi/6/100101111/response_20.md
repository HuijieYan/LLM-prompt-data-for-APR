## Bug Explanation
The bug in the `request_body_to_args` function arises from how the function handles form data for sequence types such as lists, sets, and tuples. The function fails to correctly process the form data containing repeated keys with different values, only retaining the last value for validation.

The buggy function incorrectly processes the form data for sequences like lists, sets, and tuples by considering only the last value of a repeated key. This behavior leads to validation errors as the function does not correctly handle form data containing multiple values for the same key.

## Fix Strategy
To fix this bug, we need to modify the `request_body_to_args` function to correctly handle repeated keys in form data for sequences like lists, sets, and tuples. The function should collect and store all values associated with a repeated key before performing validation.

## The Corrected Function
Here is the corrected version of the `request_body_to_args` function:

```python
async def request_body_to_args(
    required_params: List[ModelField],
    received_body: Optional[Union[Dict[str, Any], FormData]],
) -> Tuple[Dict[str, Any], List[ErrorWrapper]]:
    values = {}
    errors = []
    if received_body is not None:
        for field in required_params:
            values[field.name] = []
            for key, value in received_body:
                if key == field.alias:
                    values[field.name].append(value)
            if not values[field.name]:
                if field.required:
                    errors.append(ErrorWrapper(MissingError(), loc=("body", field.alias)))
                else:
                    values[field.name] = deepcopy(field.default)
            else:
                v_, errors_ = field.validate(values[field.name], values, loc=("body", field.alias))
                if isinstance(errors_, ErrorWrapper):
                    errors.append(errors_)
                elif isinstance(errors_, list):
                    errors.extend(errors_)
                else:
                    values[field.name] = v_
    return values, errors
```

This corrected function collects all values associated with a repeated key and stores them in a list before performing validation. This approach ensures that all values for a key are considered and correctly processed during validation.

By implementing this correction, the function now properly handles repeated keys in form data for sequences, resolving the validation errors encountered in the failing test cases.
