### Bug Explanation

The buggy function `request_body_to_args` is designed to process request body data and convert it into arguments for a FastAPI endpoint. However, the function has a bug that prevents proper handling of repeated key=value pairs in the data when using FormData. This bug is related to the issue reported on GitHub where repeated keys are not processed correctly, leading to validation issues.

The main cause of the bug lies in how the function handles repeated keys in the received FormData. When processing the data, the function only considers the last value associated with a repeated key, resulting in incorrect validation and processing of the form data.

### Bug Fix Strategy

To fix the bug and address the GitHub issue, the function should be modified to properly handle repeated key=value pairs in FormData. This can be achieved by updating the logic within the function to correctly parse and store repeated keys as lists or sets based on the expected type of the corresponding field.

### Corrected Function

Here is the corrected version of the `request_body_to_args` function:

```python
async def request_body_to_args(
    required_params: List[ModelField],
    received_body: Optional[Union[Dict[str, Any], FormData]],
) -> Tuple[Dict[str, Any], List[ErrorWrapper]]:
    values = {}
    errors = []

    for field in required_params:
        value: Any = None
        if received_body is not None:
            if field.alias in received_body:
                if isinstance(received_body[field.alias], list):
                    if not isinstance(field.type_, list):
                        errors.append(ErrorWrapper(ValueError("Expecting a single value."), loc=("body", field.alias)))
                    value = received_body[field.alias]
                else:
                    value = [received_body[field.alias]]

        v_, errors_ = field.validate(value, values, loc=("body", field.alias))
        if isinstance(errors_, ErrorWrapper):
            errors.append(errors_)
        elif isinstance(errors_, list):
            errors.extend(errors_)
        else:
            values[field.name] = v_

    return values, errors
```

By updating the function with this corrected version, it should now properly handle repeated key=value pairs in FormData, allowing for correct validation and processing of form data with FastAPI.
