### Analysis:
1. The provided buggy function `request_body_to_args` is supposed to handle converting request body data into arguments for FastAPI endpoints.
2. The function loops through the required params, retrieves values from the received body, validates them, and stores them in a dictionary.
3. The buggy function likely fails for requests with Python lists, sets, or tuples as form data due to issues in processing this non-standard form data.

### Bug Cause:
The bug in the current implementation seems to stem from how the function handles sequences like lists, sets, and tuples in the form data. It fails to properly parse and process these non-standard form data types. This leads to validation errors and incorrect responses from the FastAPI endpoints.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to modify the logic handling of sequences in the form data. The function should properly process lists, sets, and tuples in the form data and ensure correct validation of these elements.

### Correction:

```python
async def request_body_to_args(
    required_params: List[ModelField],
    received_body: Optional[Union[Dict[str, Any], FormData]],
) -> Tuple[Dict[str, Any], List[ErrorWrapper]]:
    values = {}
    errors = []

    for field in required_params:
        value: Any = None
        if received_body is not None and field.alias in received_body:
            value = received_body.get(field.alias)

        if value is None and field.required:
            errors.append(ErrorWrapper(MissingError(), loc=("body", field.alias))
        else:
            values[field.name] = value

    return values, errors
```

By adjusting the logic in the correction above, we focus on retrieving and storing values from the received form data based on the required parameters using their aliases. This modification should resolve the issue with incorrect processing of sequences in the form data.
