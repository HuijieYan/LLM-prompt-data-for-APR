### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `request_body_to_args` is used for converting request body parameters into arguments. It handles the validation of required parameters, checks for errors, reads values from the request body, and validates them against the specified parameters.
2. The function seems to have an issue related to handling non-typing sequences properly.
3. The failing tests show that when sending a list or tuple as form data, the response status code is not as expected (returns 422 instead of 200). The error indicates a validation error.
4. The GitHub issue suggests that repeated keys in form data might not be handled correctly by FastAPI.
5. To fix the bug, we need to modify the function to properly handle non-typing sequences like lists, sets, and tuples as form data.

### Bug Cause:
The bug occurs when the `request_body_to_args` function fails to handle non-typing sequences and only processes the last element in the sequence. This leads to validation errors and incorrect response status codes in the failing tests.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to modify the function to properly handle non-typing sequences in the request body. Specifically, for lists, sets, and tuples, we should iterate over all elements to process them correctly. We need to update the code to handle this scenario and ensure that the validation is performed on all elements of the non-typing sequence.

### Corrected Version:
```python
async def request_body_to_args(
    required_params: List[ModelField],
    received_body: Optional[Union[Dict[str, Any], FormData]],
) -> Tuple[Dict[str, Any], List[ErrorWrapper]]:
    values = {}
    errors = []
    for field in required_params:
        value: Any = None
        if received_body is not None:
            if field.shape in sequence_shapes and isinstance(
                received_body, FormData
            ):
                if field.shape == "list":
                    value = received_body.getlist(field.alias)
                elif field.shape == "set":
                    value = set(received_body.getlist(field.alias))
                elif field.shape == "tuple":
                    value = tuple(received_body.getlist(field.alias))
                else:
                    value = received_body.get(field.alias)
        
        if (
            value is None
            or (isinstance(field_info, params.Form) and value == "")
            or (
                isinstance(field_info, params.Form)
                and field.shape in sequence_shapes
                and len(value) == 0
            )
        ):
            if field.required:
                if PYDANTIC_1:
                    errors.append(
                        ErrorWrapper(MissingError(), loc=("body", field.alias))
                    )
                else:  
                    errors.append(
                        ErrorWrapper( 
                            MissingError(),
                            loc=("body", field.alias),
                            config=BaseConfig,
                        )
                    )
            else:
                values[field.name] = deepcopy(field.default)
            continue
            
        if (
            isinstance(field_info, params.File)
            and lenient_issubclass(field.type_, bytes)
            and isinstance(value, UploadFile)
        ):
            value = await value.read()
        elif (
            field.shape in sequence_shapes
            and isinstance(field_info, params.File)
            and lenient_issubclass(field.type_, bytes)
            and isinstance(value, sequence_types)
        ):
            awaitables = [sub_value.read() for sub_value in value]
            contents = await asyncio.gather(*awaitables)
            value = sequence_shape_to_type[field.shape](contents)
        v_, errors_ = field.validate(value, values, loc=("body", field.alias))
        if isinstance(errors_, ErrorWrapper):
            errors.append(errors_)
        elif isinstance(errors_, list):
            errors.extend(errors_)
        else:
            values[field.name] = v_

    return values, errors
```

Now, the corrected version of the `request_body_to_args` function should properly handle non-typing sequences like lists, sets, and tuples as form data. This correction should ensure that the function processes all elements of these sequences correctly during validation, fixing the bug and enabling the failing tests to pass as expected.
