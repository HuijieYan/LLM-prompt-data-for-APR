### Analysis:
1. The `request_body_to_args` function is used to extract values from the received body data based on the required parameters.
2. The function is trying to handle various cases like extracting single values or lists of values, handling file uploads, and more.
3. The failing test cases indicate that the function is not correctly handling form data when it contains lists, sets, or tuples as values.
4. The GitHub issue suggests that repeated keys in form data should be collected as a list for validation, which is not currently implemented.
5. The function does not correctly handle extracting values from form data when dealing with sequences like lists, sets, and tuples.

### Bug Cause:
- The bug occurs because the function does not account for the scenario where form data contains sequences of values (like lists, sets, tuples).
- It does not correctly handle converting these sequences to the expected types for validation.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
1. Identify the fields that are sequences (lists, sets, tuples) in the required parameters.
2. Extract the values of these fields as lists.
3. Modify the function to handle these sequences appropriately before validating the values.
4. Ensure that repeated keys in the form data are collected as lists for validation, as suggested in the GitHub issue.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
async def request_body_to_args(
    required_params: List[ModelField],
    received_body: Optional[Union[Dict[str, Any], FormData]],
) -> Tuple[Dict[str, Any], List[ErrorWrapper]]:
    values = {}
    errors = []

    if required_params:
        for field in required_params:
            field_info = get_field_info(field)
            value: Any = None

            if received_body is not None:
                if field.shape in sequence_shapes and isinstance(
                    received_body, FormData
                ):
                    value = received_body.getlist(field.alias)
                else:
                    value = received_body.get(field.alias)

            if (
                value is None
                or (isinstance(field_info, params.Form) and value == "")
                or (
                    isinstance(field_info, params.Form)
                    and field.shape in sequence_shapes
                    and len(value) == 0
                )
            ):
                if field.required:
                    errors.append(ErrorWrapper(MissingError(), loc=("body", field.alias))
                else:
                    values[field.name] = deepcopy(field.default)
                continue

            if isinstance(field_info, params.File) and lenient_issubclass(field.type_, bytes) and isinstance(value, UploadFile):
                value = await value.read()
            
            v_, errors_ = field.validate(value, values, loc=("body", field.alias))

            if isinstance(errors_, ErrorWrapper):
                errors.append(errors_)
            elif isinstance(errors_, list):
                errors.extend(errors_)
            else:
                values[field.name] = v_

    return values, errors
```

### Changes Made:
1. Removed the unnecessary check for embed and single required parameter in the loop.
2. Updated the loop to extract values for each field individually and handle sequences properly.
3. Used `getlist` method for sequence shapes like lists, sets, and tuples.
4. Refactored the validation logic to handle lists and other sequence types properly.
5. Updated the return values with the corrected values and errors.

By applying these changes, the function should now correctly extract values from form data, including sequences like lists, sets, and tuples. This should address the failing test cases and align with the GitHub issue's suggestion for handling repeated keys in form data.
