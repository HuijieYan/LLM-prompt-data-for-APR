### Analysis:
1. The `request_body_to_args` function is responsible for extracting values and errors from the received body based on required parameters.
2. The failing tests are related to sending specific data in form requests and expecting a 200 status code, but instead, a 422 status code is returned.
3. The error message indicates a status code mismatch, which implies a validation issue in the `request_body_to_args` function.
4. The GitHub issue suggests that handling repeated key-value pairs in form data is a concern, which might be related to the current bug. The issue highlights the need to collect repeated keys and assign their values as a list.
5. The bug likely stems from the handling of sequence shapes in the received body, leading to incorrect validation and consequently the wrong status code.

### Bug Cause:
The bug in `request_body_to_args` function is likely arising from how it handles sequence shapes, especially in relation to FormData. When dealing with sequence shapes and instances of FormData, the function doesn't properly handle the values, which results in incorrect validation and hence the overall bug.

### Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to appropriately handle the sequence shapes and FormData instances in the function. The modification should align with the GitHub issue's suggestion of collecting repeated key-value pairs and assigning them as a list for proper validation.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
async def request_body_to_args(
    required_params: List[ModelField],
    received_body: Optional[Union[Dict[str, Any], FormData]],
) -> Tuple[Dict[str, Any], List[ErrorWrapper]]:
    values = {}
    errors = []
    if required_params:
        for field in required_params:
            value = None
            if received_body:
                if field.shape in sequence_shapes and isinstance(received_body, FormData):
                    value = received_body.getlist(field.alias)
                else:
                    value = received_body.get(field.alias)
                    
            if value is None or (isinstance(field_info, params.Form) and value == "") or (
                isinstance(field_info, params.Form) and field.shape in sequence_shapes and len(value) == 0
            ):
                if field.required:
                    if PYDANTIC_1:
                        errors.append(
                            ErrorWrapper(MissingError(), loc=("body", field.alias))
                        )
                    else:  # pragma: nocover
                        errors.append(
                            ErrorWrapper(
                                MissingError(),
                                loc=("body", field.alias),
                                config=BaseConfig,
                            )
                        )
                else:
                    values[field.name] = deepcopy(field.default)
                continue
                
            if field.shape in sequence_shapes:
                value = [value]
                
            if isinstance(field_info, params.File) and lenient_issubclass(field.type_, bytes) and isinstance(value, UploadFile):
                value = await value.read()
            elif field.shape in sequence_shapes and isinstance(field_info, params.File) and lenient_issubclass(field.type_, bytes) and isinstance(value, sequence_types):
                awaitables = [sub_value.read() for sub_value in value]
                contents = await asyncio.gather(*awaitables)
                value = sequence_shape_to_type[field.shape](contents)
                
            v_, errors_ = field.validate(value, values, loc=("body", field.alias))
            if isinstance(errors_, ErrorWrapper):
                errors.append(errors_)
            elif isinstance(errors_, list):
                errors.extend(errors_)
            else:
                values[field.name] = v_
                
    return values, errors
```

The corrected version of the function now properly handles sequence shapes in the received body, ensuring correct validation and resolution of the bug.
