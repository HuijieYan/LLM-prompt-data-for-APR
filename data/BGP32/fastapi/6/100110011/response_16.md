### Analysis:
1. The `request_body_to_args` function is responsible for converting received body data into arguments based on required parameters. However, it fails to handle sequences like lists, sets, and tuples properly.
2. The failing test functions are testing the handling of Python lists, sets, and tuples as form data, which triggers the bug in the `request_body_to_args` function.
3. The bug causes the function to incorrectly handle sequence-shaped fields and results in a 422 status code error in the test cases due to validation issues.
4. To fix the bug, we need to correctly handle sequence-shaped fields while processing the received body data and ensure that the validation process for these fields is done accurately.
5. The corrected version of the `request_body_to_args` function is provided below.

### Correction:
```python
async def request_body_to_args(
    required_params: List[ModelField],
    received_body: Optional[Union[Dict[str, Any], FormData]],
) -> Tuple[Dict[str, Any], List[ErrorWrapper]]:
    values = {}
    errors = []
    for field in required_params:
        value: Any = None
        if received_body is not None:
            if isinstance(field.shape, Sequence) and isinstance(received_body, FormData):
                value = received_body.getlist(field.alias)
            else:
                value = received_body.get(field.alias)
        if value is None or (
            isinstance(field_info, params.Form) and not value
        ):
            if field.required:
                errors.append(
                    ErrorWrapper(MissingError(), loc=("body", field.alias))
                )
            else:
                values[field.name] = deepcopy(field.default)
            continue

        if (
            isinstance(field_info, params.File)
            and lenient_issubclass(field.type_, bytes)
            and isinstance(value, UploadFile)
        ):
            value = await value.read()
        
        v_, errors_ = field.validate(value, values, loc=("body", field.alias))
        if isinstance(errors_, ErrorWrapper):
            errors.append(errors_)
        elif isinstance(errors_, list):
            errors.extend(errors_)
        else:
            values[field.name] = v_

    return values, errors
```

By correctly handling sequence-shaped fields and their validation, the corrected version of the function should now pass the failing test cases and resolve the issue reported on GitHub.
