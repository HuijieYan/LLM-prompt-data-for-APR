### Analysis:
- The buggy function `request_body_to_args` is responsible for processing the received body data against a list of required parameters.
- The failing tests indicate that the response status code is being returned as 422 (unprocessable entity) instead of the expected status code 200. This discrepancy is likely due to errors in processing the received body data.
- The GitHub issue suggests that repeated keys in form data are not being handled correctly, leading to validation issues. This indicates a potential bug in the processing logic of the function.

### Potential Error Locations:
1. Handling of sequence shapes in form data.
2. Validation of required parameters and their values.
3. Handling of specific field types like File and their validation.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is likely due to incorrect handling of repeated keys in form data leading to validation errors. The function may not properly process sequence shapes or handle required parameters' values, resulting in failed validations.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Implement a mechanism to correctly handle repeated keys in form data.
2. Ensure proper validation of required parameters and their values.
3. Verify the handling of sequence shapes in form data for accurate processing.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
async def request_body_to_args(
    required_params: List[ModelField],
    received_body: Optional[Union[Dict[str, Any], FormData]],
) -> Tuple[Dict[str, Any], List[ErrorWrapper]]:
    values = {}
    errors = []
    if required_params:
        for field in required_params:
            value: Any = None
            if received_body is not None:
                value = received_body.get(field.alias)
            if value is None:
                if field.required:
                    errors.append(ErrorWrapper(MissingError(), loc=("body", field.alias)))
                else:
                    values[field.name] = deepcopy(field.default)
            else:
                if isinstance(field_info, params.File) and lenient_issubclass(field.type_, bytes) and isinstance(value, UploadFile):
                    value = await value.read()
                v_, errors_ = field.validate(value, values, loc=("body", field.alias))
                if isinstance(errors_, ErrorWrapper):
                    errors.append(errors_)
                elif isinstance(errors_, list):
                    errors.extend(errors_)
                else:
                    values[field.name] = v_
    return values, errors
```
In the corrected version, we simplified the handling of required parameters and their values, properly processed field values, and handled validation errors. This updated version should address the issues and pass the failing tests.
