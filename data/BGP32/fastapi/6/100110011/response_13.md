### Analysis
1. The buggy function `request_body_to_args` is responsible for extracting values and errors from incoming request body data for specified required parameters.
2. The failing tests are related to sending data as part of a POST request and expecting a response status code of 200, which is not being met due to validation errors.
3. The primary issue lies in handling sequence types like lists, sets, and tuples in the request body.
4. The GitHub issue suggests that FastAPI should support repeated key-value pairs where key names are the same in form data.

### Bug Cause
The bug is caused by the implementation of handling sequence shapes such as lists, sets, and tuples within the `request_body_to_args` function. When processing the received data, the function fails to correctly handle sequence shapes and validate the parameters, leading to errors and incorrect responses.

### Bug Fix Strategy
1. Update the function to correctly handle incoming data and validate parameters, specifically focusing on proper handling of sequence shapes.
2. Ensure that repeated key-value pairs in form data are correctly processed and assigned to the same key before validation.
3. Implement changes based on the details mentioned in the GitHub issue to support repeated key-value pairs.

### Corrected Version
```python
async def request_body_to_args(
    required_params: List[ModelField],
    received_body: Optional[Union[Dict[str, Any], FormData]],
) -> Tuple[Dict[str, Any], List[ErrorWrapper]]:
    values = {}
    errors = []
    if required_params:
        for field in required_params:
            value: Any = None
            if received_body is not None:
                if field.shape in sequence_shapes and isinstance(
                    received_body, FormData
                ):
                    if field.alias in received_body:
                        value = received_body[field.alias]
                    elif not isinstance(field_info, params.File):
                        value = []
                        for key in received_body.keys():
                            if key.startswith(field.alias):
                                value.extend(received_body.getlist(key))
                else:
                    value = received_body.get(field.alias)
            if value is None or (isinstance(field_info, params.Form) and value == ""):
                if field.required:
                    errors.append(ErrorWrapper(MissingError(), loc=("body", field.alias))
                else:
                    values[field.name] = deepcopy(field.default)
                continue
            if (
                isinstance(field_info, params.File)
                and lenient_issubclass(field.type_, bytes)
                and isinstance(value, UploadFile)
            ):
                value = await value.read()
            elif (
                field.shape in sequence_shapes
                and isinstance(field_info, params.File)
                and lenient_issubclass(field.type_, bytes)
            ):
                awaitables = [sub_value.read() for sub_value in value]
                contents = await asyncio.gather(*awaitables)
                value = sequence_shape_to_type[field.shape](contents)
            v_, errors_ = field.validate(value, values, loc=("body", field.alias))
            if isinstance(errors_, ErrorWrapper):
                errors.append(errors_)
            elif isinstance(errors_, list):
                errors.extend(errors_)
            else:
                values[field.name] = v_
    return values, errors
```

By updating the logic within the `request_body_to_args` function to properly handle sequence shapes and repeated key-value pairs, the corrected version should resolve the validation errors and enable the tests to pass successfully.
