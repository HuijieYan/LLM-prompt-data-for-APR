## Analysis
The buggy function `request_body_to_args` is responsible for converting received form data into arguments for a FastAPI endpoint. It processes each field in the form data and validates it based on the required parameters.

The error messages in the failing tests indicate that the response status code is returning a `422` (Unprocessable Entity) code instead of the expected `200` (OK). This suggests that there are validation errors in the form data processing.

The GitHub issue "Support repeated key=value in form data" highlights a related problem where repeated keys in form data are not handled correctly, leading to validation issues.

## Bug Explanation
The bug in `request_body_to_args` most likely lies in how the function handles multiple values for the same key in the form data. When processing form data with repeated keys, only the last value is considered, causing validation errors and resulting in a `422` status code.

The specific issue arises when processing sequences (like lists, sets, or tuples) in form data. The function does not handle them correctly, leading to incorrect validation and status code responses.

## Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to enhance the handling of repeated keys in form data, especially for sequences like lists, sets, and tuples. We should ensure that all values associated with a key are considered and processed correctly during validation.

## Corrected Version of the Function
```python
async def request_body_to_args(
    required_params: List[ModelField],
    received_body: Optional[Union[Dict[str, Any], FormData]],
) -> Tuple[Dict[str, Any], List[ErrorWrapper]]:
    values = {}
    errors = []
    if required_params:
        for field in required_params:
            if received_body is not None:
                field_values = received_body.getlist(field.alias)
                if not field_values:
                    field_values = [received_body.get(field.alias, None)]
            else:
                field_values = [None]
            for value in field_values:
                if (
                    value is None
                    or (isinstance(field_info, params.Form) and value == "")
                    or (
                        isinstance(field_info, params.Form)
                        and field.shape in sequence_shapes
                        and len(value) == 0
                    )
                ):
                    if field.required:
                        if PYDANTIC_1:
                            errors.append(
                                ErrorWrapper(MissingError(), loc=("body", field.alias))
                            )
                        else:
                            errors.append(
                                ErrorWrapper(
                                    MissingError(),
                                    loc=("body", field.alias),
                                    config=BaseConfig,
                                )
                            )
                    else:
                        values[field.name] = deepcopy(field.default)
                    continue
                if (
                    isinstance(field_info, params.File)
                    and lenient_issubclass(field.type_, bytes)
                    and isinstance(value, UploadFile)
                ):
                    value = await value.read()
                elif (
                    field.shape in sequence_shapes
                    and isinstance(field_info, params.File)
                    and lenient_issubclass(field.type_, bytes)
                    and isinstance(value, sequence_types)
                ):
                    awaitables = [sub_value.read() for sub_value in value]
                    contents = await asyncio.gather(*awaitables)
                    value = sequence_shape_to_type[field.shape](contents)
                v_, errors_ = field.validate(value, values, loc=("body", field.alias))
                if isinstance(errors_, ErrorWrapper):
                    errors.append(errors_)
                elif isinstance(errors_, list):
                    errors.extend(errors_)
                else:
                    values[field.name] = v_
    return values, errors
```

In the corrected version, we iterate over each field in the required params and correctly handle multiple values associated with the same key. This change should resolve the bug and ensure that all values are considered during validation.

After applying this fix, re-run the failing tests to confirm that the bug has been successfully addressed.
