### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `request_body_to_args` is responsible for extracting request body parameters and converting them to arguments. It iterates over the required parameters and processes them based on the received body data.
   
2. The failing test cases indicate that the function is not handling the conversion of form data properly when dealing with Python list, set, and tuple parameters. The assert statements in the failing test cases are expecting a different response status code (200) but receiving a 422 status code, indicating a validation error.

3. The failing test cases are triggered due to the inconsistent handling of sequence-shaped fields (such as lists, sets, tuples) in the request body processing logic of the `request_body_to_args` function. The function is unable to parse and validate these data structures correctly, leading to validation errors.

4. To fix the bug, the `request_body_to_args` function needs to be modified to correctly handle sequence-shaped fields in form data. Specifically, when processing a sequence-shaped field, the function should extract the values correctly from the request body data and handle the validation process appropriately.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Modify the logic for processing sequence-shaped fields in the `request_body_to_args` function to extract values from form data accurately.
2. Ensure that the validation of sequence-shaped fields is performed correctly to avoid validation errors.
3. Update the function to handle Python list, set, and tuple parameters in form data appropriately.

### Bug-fixed version of the function:
```python
async def request_body_to_args(
    required_params: List[ModelField],
    received_body: Optional[Union[Dict[str, Any], FormData]],
) -> Tuple[Dict[str, Any], List[ErrorWrapper]]:
    values = {}
    errors = []
    for field in required_params:
        value: Any = None
        if received_body is not None:
            if field.shape in sequence_shapes and isinstance(
                received_body, FormData
            ):
                if field.alias in received_body:
                    if field.shape in sequence_shapes:
                        value = received_body.getlist(field.alias)
                    else:
                        value = received_body[field.alias]
            else:
                value = received_body.get(field.alias)
        
        if value is None and field.required:
            errors.append(
                ErrorWrapper(MissingError(), loc=("body", field.alias))
            )
        else:
            v_, errors_ = field.validate(value, values, loc=("body", field.alias))
            if isinstance(errors_, ErrorWrapper):
                errors.append(errors_)
            elif isinstance(errors_, list):
                errors.extend(errors_)
            else:
                values[field.name] = v_

    return values, errors
```

By updating the `request_body_to_args` function with the corrected implementation, the function should now accurately extract and validate sequence-shaped fields in the form data, resolving the validation errors encountered in the failing test cases.
