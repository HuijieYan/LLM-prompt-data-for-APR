### Analysis
- The `request_body_to_args` function is responsible for converting received body data into arguments based on required parameters.
- The function iterates over each required parameter and processes the received data accordingly.
- The function needs to handle different shapes of fields such as files, sequences, etc.
- The failing tests have provided in the test files are related to sending data using different Python structures like lists, sets, and tuples.

### Error Locations
1. The handling of sequences such as lists is causing an issue when the received body is processed.
2. The logic for constructing values and handling errors needs improvement to correctly handle the received data.

### Bug Cause
The bug is likely caused due to incorrect handling of sequences in the received body. The function is not processing list data correctly when received as form data. This causes validation errors, leading to the failing tests.

### Bug Fix Strategy
1. Modify the data processing logic for handling sequences like lists.
2. Update the error handling logic to provide the correct error information.
3. Ensure values are correctly constructed based on the received data.

### Corrected Function

Here is the corrected version of the `request_body_to_args` function:

```python
async def request_body_to_args(
    required_params: List[ModelField],
    received_body: Optional[Union[Dict[str, Any], FormData]],
) -> Tuple[Dict[str, Any], List[ErrorWrapper]]:
    values = {}
    errors = []
    for field in required_params:
        value: Any = None
        if received_body is not None:
            if field.shape in sequence_shapes and isinstance(received_body, FormData):
                value = received_body.getlist(field.alias)
            else:
                value = received_body.get(field.alias)

        if value is None and field.required:
            if PYDANTIC_1:
                errors.append(ErrorWrapper(MissingError(), loc=("body", field.alias)))
            else:
                errors.append(
                    ErrorWrapper(MissingError(), loc=("body", field.alias), config=BaseConfig)
                )
            continue

        if isinstance(field_info, params.File) and lenient_issubclass(field.type_, bytes):
            if isinstance(value, UploadFile):
                value = await value.read()
            elif isinstance(value, list) and all(isinstance(v, UploadFile) for v in value):
                awaitables = [v.read() for v in value]
                value = await asyncio.gather(*awaitables)

        v_, errors_ = field.validate(value, values, loc=("body", field.alias))
        if isinstance(errors_, ErrorWrapper):
            errors.append(errors_)
        elif isinstance(errors_, list):
            errors.extend(errors_)
        else:
            values[field.name] = v_

    return values, errors
```

With this corrected version of the function, it should now handle sequences in the received body correctly and pass the failing tests related to processing Python structures like lists, sets, and tuples.
