### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `request_body_to_args` is responsible for converting request body data into arguments for request processing.
2. The failing tests are related to passing Python sequences as form data in the request.
3. The failing tests are producing a 422 status code instead of the expected 200 status code when asserting the response status code.
4. The bug occurs because the function does not handle Python sequences correctly when processing form data.
5. The GitHub issue highlights the issue related to repeated key-value pairs in form data.
6. The current function fails to correctly process Python sequences when converting form data, leading to incorrect values and error responses.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is caused by the incorrect processing of Python sequences (`list`, `set`, `tuple`) provided as form data in the request. The function `request_body_to_args` does not handle sequences in the received body properly, leading to incorrect values and error responses.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Identify the locations where the function incorrectly processes Python sequences.
2. Update the processing logic to correctly handle Python sequences provided as form data.
3. Ensure that the received Python sequences are converted correctly to the expected data type before validation.
4. Add checks to handle sequences in the received body and process them accordingly.

### Bug-fixed version:
```python
async def request_body_to_args(
    required_params: List[ModelField],
    received_body: Optional[Union[Dict[str, Any], FormData]],
) -> Tuple[Dict[str, Any], List[ErrorWrapper]]:
    values = {}
    errors = []
    if required_params:
        for field in required_params:
            embed = getattr(get_field_info(field), "embed", None)
            if embed is not None:
                values[field.name] = received_body
                continue

            value: Any = None
            if received_body is not None:
                if isinstance(received_body, FormData):
                    value = received_body.getlist(field.alias)
                else:
                    value = received_body.get(field.alias)

            if value is None or value == "":
                if field.required:
                    errors.append(ErrorWrapper(MissingError(), loc=("body", field.alias)))
                else:
                    values[field.name] = deepcopy(field.default)
                continue

            if isinstance(value, list):
                v_, errors_ = field.validate(value, values, loc=("body", field.alias))
            else:
                v_, errors_ = field.validate(value[0], values, loc=("body", field.alias))

            if isinstance(errors_, ErrorWrapper):
                errors.append(errors_)
            elif isinstance(errors_, list):
                errors.extend(errors_)
            else:
                values[field.name] = v_

    return values, errors
```

This updated version of the `request_body_to_args` function now correctly handles Python sequences provided as form data. It checks for list type values in the received body and validates them accordingly. This should resolve the bug and make the function work as expected with Python sequences provided in the request body.
