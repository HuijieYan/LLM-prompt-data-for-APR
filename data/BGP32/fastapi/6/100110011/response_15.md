### Analysis:
1. The function `request_body_to_args` is responsible for converting received body data into arguments for FastAPI dependencies. It iterates through the required parameters, retrieves values from the received body data, and handles different cases for validation.
2. The failing tests are related to sending form data with sequences like lists, sets, and tuples.
3. The error message "assert 422 == 200" indicates that the responses are not successful (status code 422 instead of 200) due to validation issues.
4. The GitHub issue highlights the need to support repeated key-value pairs in form data, which the current function does not handle properly for sequences.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is caused by the handling of sequences in the form data. The function does not correctly process the values of sequences like lists, sets, and tuples, leading to validation errors and incorrect responses.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
1. Modify the function to correctly handle repeated key-value pairs for sequences in form data.
2. Ensure that the values of sequences are processed and validated properly.
3. Update the function to support the required behavior described in the GitHub issue.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
async def request_body_to_args(
    required_params: List[ModelField],
    received_body: Optional[Union[Dict[str, Any], FormData]],
) -> Tuple[Dict[str, Any], List[ErrorWrapper]]:
    values = {}
    errors = []
    if required_params:
        for field in required_params:
            value: Any = None
            if received_body is not None:
                if field.shape in sequence_shapes and isinstance(received_body, FormData):
                    value = received_body.getlist(field.alias)
                else:
                    value = received_body.get(field.alias)
            if (
                field.required
                and (value is None or (isinstance(field_info, params.Form) and value == ""))
            ):
                errors.append(ErrorWrapper(MissingError(), loc=("body", field.alias))
            elif value is None:
                values[field.name] = field.default
            else:
                v_, errors_ = field.validate(value, values, loc=("body", field.alias))
                if isinstance(errors_, ErrorWrapper):
                    errors.append(errors_)
                elif isinstance(errors_, list):
                    errors.extend(errors_)
                else:
                    values[field.name] = v_
    return values, errors
```

With these corrections, the function should now correctly handle form data with sequences and pass the failing tests. This updated version ensures that sequences are processed and validated according to the received data.
