### Analysis:
1. The `request_body_to_args` function takes a list of required parameters and a received body (either a dictionary or FormData).
2. The function iterates through the required parameters and attempts to retrieve the corresponding values from the received body.
3. Errors are collected if required values are missing or fail validation. The errors are stored in a list.
4. The current implementation seems to have issues handling sequence shapes (like lists, sets, tuples) when retrieving values from FormData.

### Issue:
The error in the `request_body_to_args` function prevents the correct extraction of values from the body in cases where sequence shapes are involved. This leads to failing tests and mismatched status codes. The issue is related to how the function handles sequence shapes in the received body.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to adjust the logic related to handling sequence shapes (such as lists, sets, tuples) in the received body. Proper validation for each type of shape should be implemented. The fix should ensure that values are correctly extracted from the FormData based on the shape and type expected by the required parameters.

### Bug Fix:
Here is a corrected version of the `request_body_to_args` function:

```python
async def request_body_to_args(
    required_params: List[ModelField],
    received_body: Optional[Union[Dict[str, Any], FormData]],
) -> Tuple[Dict[str, Any], List[ErrorWrapper]]:
    values = {}
    errors = []
    if required_params:
        for field in required_params:
            if received_body is not None:
                if isinstance(received_body, FormData):
                    if field.shape in sequence_shapes:
                        value = received_body.getlist(field.alias)
                    else:
                        value = received_body.get(field.alias)
                else:
                    value = None

                if (
                    value is None
                    or (isinstance(field_info, params.Form) and value == "")
                    or (
                        isinstance(field_info, params.Form)
                        and field.shape in sequence_shapes
                        and len(value) == 0
                    )
                ):
                    if field.required:
                        if PYDANTIC_1:
                            errors.append(
                                ErrorWrapper(MissingError(), loc=("body", field.alias))
                            )
                        else:
                            errors.append(
                                ErrorWrapper(MissingError(), loc=("body", field.alias), config=BaseConfig)
                            )
                    else:
                        values[field.name] = deepcopy(field.default)
                    continue
                
                if field.shape in sequence_shapes:
                    if isinstance(field_info, params.File) and lenient_issubclass(field.type_, bytes):
                        if isinstance(value, UploadFile):
                            value = await value.read()
                    elif isinstance(field_info, params.File) and lenient_issubclass(field.type_, bytes):
                        awaitables = [sub_value.read() for sub_value in value]
                        contents = await asyncio.gather(*awaitables)
                        value = sequence_shape_to_type[field.shape](contents)
                
                v_, errors_ = field.validate(value, values, loc=("body", field.alias))
                if isinstance(errors_, ErrorWrapper):
                    errors.append(errors_)
                elif isinstance(errors_, list):
                    errors.extend(errors_)
                else:
                    values[field.name] = v_
    return values, errors
```

This corrected version addresses the issues related to sequence shapes in the received body and ensures that values are extracted and validated correctly based on the type and shape of the required parameters. This fix should enable the function to handle sequences properly and pass the failing tests as mentioned.
