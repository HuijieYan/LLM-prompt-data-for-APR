### Analysis
1. The buggy function is named `request_body_to_args`, which is responsible for converting request body information into arguments.
2. This function is supposed to extract values from the request body based on the required parameters provided.
3. The function seems to have issues with handling different types of request data, which is causing the response status code to be incorrect in the failing tests.
4. The provided failing tests expect a 200 status code and specific responses for different types of sequence parameters (list, set, tuple) sent as form data.
5. The GitHub issue mentioned in the context states the problem about supporting repeated key-value pairs in form data, which is not correctly handled in the current implementation.

### Bug Cause
1. The bug seems to be caused by the incorrect handling of sequence types in the request body when converting them into arguments.
2. The function seems to treat all sequences in the same way, not distinguishing between lists, sets, and tuples, thus causing validation errors.
3. As a result, the response status code is incorrect, and the data extraction process does not work as expected, leading to validation issues.

### Bug Fix Strategy
1. Update the function to correctly handle different types of sequences (lists, sets, tuples) in the request body.
2. Ensure that repeated key-values in form data are processed correctly and assigned as lists to the same key before validation.
3. Modify the extraction logic to consider the type of sequence and handle it appropriately according to the field information.
4. Properly validate the extracted values and generate errors if necessary to maintain data integrity.

### Bug-fixed Function
```python
async def request_body_to_args(
    required_params: List[ModelField],
    received_body: Optional[Union[Dict[str, Any], FormData]],
) -> Tuple[Dict[str, Any], List[ErrorWrapper]]:
    values = {}
    errors = []
    if required_params:
        for field in required_params:
            value: Any = None
            if received_body is not None:
                shape = get_field_info(field).shape
                if shape in sequence_shapes and isinstance(received_body, FormData):
                    value = received_body.getlist(field.alias)
                else:
                    value = received_body.get(field.alias)
            if value is not None or not field.required:
                if shape in sequence_shapes:
                    value = sequence_shape_to_type[shape](value)
                v_, errors_ = field.validate(value, values, loc=('body', field.alias))
                if isinstance(errors_, ErrorWrapper):
                    errors.append(errors_)
                elif isinstance(errors_, list):
                    errors.extend(errors_)
                else:
                    values[field.name] = v_
            else:
                if field.required:
                    errors.append(ErrorWrapper(MissingError(), loc=('body', field.alias)))
                else:
                    values[field.name] = deepcopy(field.default)
    return values, errors
```

By revising the logic for handling sequence data and ensuring proper validation and error reporting, the bug should be fixed, leading to correct processing of different types of sequence parameters sent as form data.
