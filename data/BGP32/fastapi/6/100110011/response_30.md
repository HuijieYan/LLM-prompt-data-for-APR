### Analysis
1. The buggy function `request_body_to_args` is responsible for converting received body data into arguments for API endpoints.
2. The function expects a list of required parameters (`required_params`) and the received data (`received_body`) that may be a dictionary or `FormData`.
3. The bug seems to be related to handling list values in the received body data.
4. The failing tests indicate errors in the status code and incorrect response data returned.
5. The GitHub issue suggests that FastAPI should handle repeated keys in form data correctly.

### Bug Cause
1. The function fails to correctly handle situations where a parameter with sequence shapes (e.g., list, set, tuple) is passed in the body data.
2. When values for these parameters are supplied as lists, sets, or tuples in the received body, the function does not properly extract and validate them.

### Bug Fix Strategy
1. Modify the logic to correctly handle extracting sequence-shaped values from the received body data.
2. Handle repeated keys in the form data by collecting them correctly and assigning the values as a list before validation.

### Updated Function
```python
async def request_body_to_args(
    required_params: List[ModelField],
    received_body: Optional[Union[Dict[str, Any], FormData]],
) -> Tuple[Dict[str, Any], List[ErrorWrapper]]:
    values = {}
    errors = []
    if required_params:
        for field in required_params:
            value: Any = None
            field_info = get_field_info(field)
            if received_body is not None:
                if field.shape in sequence_shapes:
                    if field.alias in received_body:
                        value = received_body[field.alias]
                    elif field.name in received_body:
                        value = received_body[field.name]

                    if isinstance(value, list):
                        value = value
                    elif isinstance(value, str):
                        value = [value]
                else:
                    value = received_body.get(field.alias)

            if value is None or (
                isinstance(field_info, params.Form) and isinstance(value, list) and len(value) == 0
            ):
                if field.required:
                    errors.append(
                        ErrorWrapper(MissingError(), loc=("body", field.alias))
                    )
                else:
                    values[field.name] = deepcopy(field.default)
            else:
                v_, errors_ = field.validate(value, values, loc=("body", field.alias))
                if isinstance(errors_, ErrorWrapper):
                    errors.append(errors_)
                elif isinstance(errors_, list):
                    errors.extend(errors_)
                else:
                    values[field.name] = v_

    return values, errors
```

### Conclusion
The updated function now correctly handles extracting sequence values from the received body data and ensures correct validation. This should resolve the issues faced in the failing tests and align with the expectations mentioned in the GitHub issue.
