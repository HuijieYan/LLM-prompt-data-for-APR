### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `request_body_to_args` is responsible for converting received body data into arguments for the request.
2. The buggy function is failing to handle form data properly, especially in cases where sequences like lists, sets, and tuples are passed as form data.
3. The failing tests are trying to send form data with lists, sets, and tuples as values, but the buggy function doesn't handle these cases correctly, resulting in a `422` status code (Unprocessable Entity) instead of the expected `200` status code.
4. The GitHub issue mentioned above suggests support for repeated key-value pairs in form data, which could be related to the bug identified in the function.

### Bug Cause:
1. The bug in the function arises from the incorrect handling of form data containing sequences.
2. When processing form data with sequences like lists, sets, or tuples, the function fails to extract the values correctly and encode them as expected.
3. This results in validation errors or incorrect values being stored in the output dictionary.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Update the function `request_body_to_args` to handle form data with sequences appropriately.
2. Modify the logic for extracting values from form data based on the type of field and shape.
3. Ensure that sequences like lists, sets, and tuples are parsed and processed correctly to avoid validation errors and incorrect results.
4. Consider incorporating the suggestion from the GitHub issue to support repeated key-value pairs in form data.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
async def request_body_to_args(
    required_params: List[ModelField],
    received_body: Optional[Union[Dict[str, Any], FormData]],
) -> Tuple[Dict[str, Any], List[ErrorWrapper]]:
    values = {}
    errors = []
    if required_params:
        for field in required_params:
            value: Any = None
            if received_body is not None:
                if field.shape in sequence_shapes and isinstance(
                    received_body, FormData
                ):
                    value = received_body.getlist(field.alias)
                else:
                    value = received_body.get(field.alias)
            if (
                value is None
                or (isinstance(get_field_info(field), params.Form) and value == "")
                or (
                    isinstance(get_field_info(field), params.Form)
                    and field.shape in sequence_shapes
                    and len(value) == 0
                )
            ):
                if field.required:
                    if PYDANTIC_1:
                        errors.append(
                            ErrorWrapper(MissingError(), loc=("body", field.alias))
                        )
                    else:  # pragma: nocover
                        errors.append(
                            ErrorWrapper(  # type: ignore
                                MissingError(),
                                loc=("body", field.alias),
                                config=BaseConfig,
                            )
                        )
                else:
                    values[field.name] = deepcopy(field.default)
                continue
            if (
                isinstance(get_field_info(field), params.File)
                and lenient_issubclass(field.type_, bytes)
                and isinstance(value, UploadFile)
            ):
                value = await value.read()
            elif (
                field.shape in sequence_shapes
                and isinstance(get_field_info(field), params.File)
                and lenient_issubclass(field.type_, bytes)
                and isinstance(value, sequence_types)
            ):
                awaitables = [sub_value.read() for sub_value in value]
                contents = await asyncio.gather(*awaitables)
                value = sequence_shape_to_type[field.shape](contents)
            v_, errors_ = field.validate(value, values, loc=("body", field.alias))
            if isinstance(errors_, ErrorWrapper):
                errors.append(errors_)
            elif isinstance(errors_, list):
                errors.extend(errors_)
            else:
                values[field.name] = v_
    return values, errors
```

This corrected version of the function should now handle form data with sequences correctly and resolve the validation errors observed in the failing tests.
