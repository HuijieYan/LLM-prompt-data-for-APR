### Explanation:
The bug in the `request_body_to_args` function causes incorrect handling of nested sequence structures like lists, sets, and tuples. The function fails to properly extract values from the received body when dealing with elements that are part of a sequence.

1. In the case of handling lists or sets, the function fails to correctly handle fetching the values from the FormData type. Instead of extracting the values correctly from the received body, it just picks up the first element in each case.

2. For tuples, it faces a similar issue where it captures the first element of the tuple and treats it as a single value instead of separating out the individual elements of the tuple into a tuple structure.

To fix this issue, the function needs to properly extract values from the received body based on the data structure and the nature of the field it is dealing with.

### Strategy for fixing the bug:
1. Update the logic for extracting values from the received body to correctly handle lists, sets, and tuples.
2. When encountering a sequence shape, iterate over the elements of the sequence and extract the values accordingly to form the desired data structure.
3. Adjust the logic for setting values in the `values` dictionary to match the data structure requirements.
4. Ensure that the values of the extracted fields are used correctly for validation and setting the final values.

### The corrected version of the function:
```python
async def request_body_to_args(
    required_params: List[ModelField],
    received_body: Optional[Union[Dict[str, Any], FormData]],
) -> Tuple[Dict[str, Any], List[ErrorWrapper]]:
    values = {}
    errors = []
    if required_params:
        for field in required_params:
            value: Any = None
            if received_body is not None:
                value = (
                    received_body.getlist(field.alias)
                    if field.shape in sequence_shapes and isinstance(received_body, FormData)
                    else received_body.get(field.alias)
                )
            if value is None or (isinstance(field_info, params.Form) and value == ""):
                if field.required:
                    errors.append(ErrorWrapper(MissingError(), loc=("body", field.alias)))
                else:
                    values[field.name] = deepcopy(field.default)
                continue
            if field.shape in sequence_shapes and not isinstance(value, sequence_types):
                value = [value]
            if isinstance(field_info, params.File) and lenient_issubclass(field.type_, bytes) and isinstance(value, UploadFile):
                value = await value.read()
            elif field.shape in sequence_shapes and lenient_issubclass(field.type_, bytes) and isinstance(value, sequence_types):
                awaitables = [sub_value.read() for sub_value in value]
                contents = await asyncio.gather(*awaitables)
                value = sequence_shape_to_type[field.shape](contents)
            v_, errors_ = field.validate(value, values, loc=("body", field.alias))
            if isinstance(errors_, ErrorWrapper):
                errors.append(errors_)
            elif isinstance(errors_, list):
                errors.extend(errors_)
            else:
                values[field.name] = v_

    return values, errors
```

By updating the function to properly handle nested sequence structures, the corrected version should now be able to handle lists, sets, and tuples correctly when extracting values from the received body. This change should make the function handle the failing tests and meet the expected input/output values.
