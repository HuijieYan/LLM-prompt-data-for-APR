## Analysis
The buggy function `request_body_to_args` is designed to extract values from the received body based on the required parameters and return a dictionary of values along with any errors encountered during the process.

Looking at the buggy code, there are several potential issues:
1. The logic for processing sequence shapes like lists, sets, and tuples based on the received body seems to be causing errors.
2. The comparison of status codes in the failing tests suggests that the function is not returning the correct values for the expected output.

The failing tests are targeting different forms of sequence inputs (lists, sets, and tuples) and expect the function to correctly process these inputs and return the corresponding values in the expected format.

## Bugs
The bugs in the function are causing it to return incorrect or incomplete values:
1. An issue with handling sequence shapes leads to errors in processing input data for lists, sets, and tuples.
2. Incorrect handling of the values extracted from the received body results in missing or wrong outputs.

## Strategy for Fixing the Bug
To fix the bugs in the function:
1. Ensure that the function correctly processes sequence shapes like lists, sets, and tuples.
2. Correctly extract values from the received body and populate the output dictionary with the correct data structure.

## Corrected Version of the Function

```python
async def request_body_to_args(
    required_params: List[ModelField],
    received_body: Optional[Union[Dict[str, Any], FormData]],
) -> Tuple[Dict[str, Any], List[ErrorWrapper]]:
    values = {}
    errors = []

    for field in required_params:
        value: Any = None
        if received_body is not None:
            if field.shape in sequence_shapes and isinstance(received_body, FormData):
                if isinstance(field.type_, list):
                    value = [received_body.getlist(field.alias)]
                elif isinstance(field.type_, set):
                    value = set(received_body.getlist(field.alias))
                elif isinstance(field.type_, tuple):
                    value = tuple(received_body.getlist(field.alias))
            else:
                value = received_body.get(field.alias)

        if value is None or value == "":
            if field.required:
                if PYDANTIC_1:
                    errors.append(ErrorWrapper(MissingError(), loc=("body", field.alias)))
                else:
                    errors.append(
                        ErrorWrapper(MissingError(), loc=("body", field.alias), config=BaseConfig)
                    )
            else:
                values[field.name] = deepcopy(field.default)
            continue

        if isinstance(field_info, params.File) and lenient_issubclass(field.type_, bytes) and isinstance(value, UploadFile):
            value = await value.read()

        v_, errors_ = field.validate(value, values, loc=("body", field.alias))
        if isinstance(errors_, ErrorWrapper):
            errors.append(errors_)
        elif isinstance(errors_, list):
            errors.extend(errors_)
        else:
            values[field.name] = v_

    return values, errors
```

This corrected version of the function should now handle sequence shapes appropriately and extract values from the received body correctly based on the corresponding parameter types.
