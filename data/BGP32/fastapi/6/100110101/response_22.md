### Steps to correct the buggy function:

1. The function is responsible for converting received request body data to arguments based on required parameters. The error is likely caused due to incorrect handling of sequence-shaped data like lists, sets, and tuples. The incorrect handling leads to the failing tests with the error status code mismatch (422 instead of 200).

2. The potential error locations in the buggy function are:
   - The handling of sequence-shaped data in the received body.
   - The validation and assignment of values to fields.

3. The bug is caused by the incorrect handling of sequence-shaped data when parsing the request body. The `value = received_body.get(field.alias)` line does not handle sequence-shaped data correctly, leading to errors in validation and hence the incorrect response status code. The function should extract the value as appropriate based on the shape of the field.

4. To fix the bug:
   - Update the logic for extracting values from the received body for sequence-shaped fields.
   - Ensure that the values are correctly validated and assigned to the fields.

5. Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
async def request_body_to_args(
    required_params: List[ModelField],
    received_body: Optional[Union[Dict[str, Any], FormData]],
) -> Tuple[Dict[str, Any], List[ErrorWrapper]]:
    values = {}
    errors = []
    for field in required_params:
        value: Any = None

        if received_body is not None:
            if field.shape in sequence_shapes and isinstance(received_body, FormData):
                if field.shape == 1:
                    value = received_body.getlist(field.alias)
                else:
                    value = []
                    for i in range(len(received_body.getlist(field.alias))):
                        value.append(cast(List[bytes], await received_body.getlist(field.alias)))

            else:
                value = received_body.get(field.alias)

        if value is None:
            if field.required:
                if PYDANTIC_1:
                    errors.append(
                        ErrorWrapper(MissingError(), loc=("body", field.alias))
                    )
                else:  # pragma: nocover
                    errors.append(
                        ErrorWrapper(  # type: ignore
                            MissingError(),
                            loc=("body", field.alias),
                            config=BaseConfig,
                        )
                    )
            else:
                values[field.name] = deepcopy(field.default)
            continue

        v_, errors_ = field.validate(value, values, loc=("body", field.alias))

        if isinstance(errors_, ErrorWrapper):
            errors.append(errors_)
        elif isinstance(errors_, list):
            errors.extend(errors_)
        else:
            values[field.name] = v_

    return values, errors
```

This corrected version of the function should now handle sequence-shaped fields correctly and pass the failing test cases with the expected status code 200.
