## Analysis
1. The `request_body_to_args` function is responsible for converting received body data into arguments based on the required parameters specified.
2. The bug likely lies in the handling of different shapes of the field values, especially lists, sets, and tuples.
3. The failing tests show assertion errors due to a status code of 422 being returned instead of the expected 200. This indicates that the function is not processing the received data correctly.
4. To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the function correctly handles the conversion of different sequence types (lists, sets, tuples) and extracts the values appropriately for validation.

## Bug Fix Strategy
- Update the way values are extracted based on the field type and shape.
- Consider specific cases for different types of sequences such as lists, sets, and tuples.
- Adjust the validation process to handle sequence-like data structures properly.

## Bug-fixed Function
```python
async def request_body_to_args(
    required_params: List[ModelField],
    received_body: Optional[Union[Dict[str, Any], FormData]],
) -> Tuple[Dict[str, Any], List[ErrorWrapper]]:
    values = {}
    errors = []
    sequence_shapes = {Sequence, set, tuple, list}

    for field in required_params:
        value: Any = None
        field_info = get_field_info(field)
        if received_body is not None:
            if field.shape in sequence_shapes:
                value = received_body.getlist(field.alias) if isinstance(received_body, FormData) else received_body.get(field.alias)
            else:
                value = received_body.get(field.alias)

        if value is None or (isinstance(field_info, params.Form) and value == "") or (
            isinstance(field_info, params.Form)
            and field.shape in sequence_shapes
            and len(value or []) == 0
        ):
            if field.required:
                errors.append(ErrorWrapper(MissingError(), loc=("body", field.alias)))
            else:
                values[field.name] = deepcopy(field.default)
            continue
        
        if isinstance(field_info, params.File) and lenient_issubclass(field.type_, bytes) and isinstance(value, UploadFile):
            value = await value.read()
        
        v_, errors_ = field.validate(value, values, loc=("body", field.alias))
        if isinstance(errors_, (ErrorWrapper, list)):
            errors.extend(errors_)
        else:
            values[field.name] = v_

    return values, errors
```

This corrected version should now properly handle extracting values from different sequence types and perform validation accordingly. It addresses the issues mentioned in the failing tests and aims to fulfill the expected input/output values in all relevant cases.
