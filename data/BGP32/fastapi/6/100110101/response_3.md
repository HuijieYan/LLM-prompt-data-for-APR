### Analysis:
The `request_body_to_args` function is designed to extract values from a received body based on a list of required parameters (ModelField objects). The bug seems to be related to how it processes sequence shapes like lists, sets, and tuples within the received body.

### Identified Bug:
The bug occurs when handling sequence shapes like lists, sets, and tuples where the received body doesn't align with the expected structure. This results in validation failures and incorrect status codes in the tests.

### Bug Explanation:
The bug is likely caused by how the function interprets and retrieves values from the received body for sequence-shaped fields. Instead of correctly handling sequences, the current implementation fails to parse them properly, leading to validation errors.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to adjust the logic for handling sequence shapes and ensure that the function correctly processes and validates the contents of these shapes without causing errors. This might involve refining how the function extracts and processes values from the received body, especially for sequence-shaped fields.

### Corrected Function:

```python
async def request_body_to_args(
    required_params: List[ModelField],
    received_body: Optional[Union[Dict[str, Any], FormData]],
) -> Tuple[Dict[str, Any], List[ErrorWrapper]]:
    values = {}
    errors = []
    if required_params:
        for field in required_params:
            field_info = get_field_info(field)
            embed = getattr(field_info, "embed", None)
            if len(required_params) == 1 and not embed:
                received_body = {field.alias: received_body}
            value: Any = None
            if received_body is not None:
                value = received_body.getlist(field.alias) if field.shape in sequence_shapes else received_body.get(field.alias)
            if (
                value is None
                or (isinstance(field_info, params.Form) and value == "")
                or (
                    isinstance(field_info, params.Form)
                    and field.shape in sequence_shapes
                    and len(value) == 0
                )
            ):
                if field.required:
                    errors.append(
                        ErrorWrapper(MissingError(), loc=("body", field.alias))
                    )
                else:
                    values[field.name] = deepcopy(field.default)
                continue
            if (
                isinstance(field_info, params.File)
                and lenient_issubclass(field.type_, bytes)
                and isinstance(value, UploadFile)
            ):
                value = await value.read()
            v_, errors_ = field.validate(value, values, loc=("body", field.alias))
            if isinstance(errors_, ErrorWrapper):
                errors.append(errors_)
            elif isinstance(errors_, list):
                errors.extend(errors_)
            else:
                values[field.name] = v_
    return values, errors
```

By adjusting the logic for handling sequence shapes within the function, we can ensure that the correct values are retrieved and validated, addressing the bug and enabling the function to pass the failing tests.
