### Analysis and Explanation:
1. The buggy function `request_body_to_args` is designed to convert received body data into arguments based on required parameters. The function iterates through the required parameters, extracts values from the received body, performs validations, and generates errors if needed.
2. The issues leading to failures in the provided test cases are related to the processing of sequences (list, set, tuple) when handling form data.
3. The identified issues occur when iterating over multiple items in the form data. The current implementation misinterprets the sequence shapes and fails to extract the correct values for sequences.
4. To fix the bug, the logic responsible for handling sequences such as lists, sets, and tuples should be updated to properly extract their values from the form data.
5. Considering the above analysis, a correction in the logic for handling sequences in form data is necessary to address the failure in the test cases.

### Corrected Function:
```python
async def request_body_to_args(
    required_params: List[ModelField],
    received_body: Optional[Union[Dict[str, Any], FormData]],
) -> Tuple[Dict[str, Any], List[ErrorWrapper]]:
    values = {}
    errors = []
    sequence_shapes = {1, 2}  # Shapes for list, set, and tuple
    sequence_types = (list, set, tuple)
    sequence_shape_to_type = {1: list, 2: set}  # Mapping of sequence shapes to types

    if required_params:
        field = required_params[0]
        field_info = get_field_info(field)
        embed = getattr(field_info, "embed", None)
        if len(required_params) == 1 and not embed:
            received_body = {field.alias: received_body}
        for field in required_params:
            value: Any = None
            if received_body is not None:
                if field.shape in sequence_shapes and isinstance(received_body, FormData):
                    if field.shape == 2:
                        # For sets, convert to set and extract values
                        value = set(received_body.getlist(field.alias))
                    elif field.shape == 1:
                        # For lists and tuples, extract values
                        value = received_body.getlist(field.alias)
                else:
                    value = received_body.get(field.alias)
            
            if value is None:
                # Field is missing in the body, check if it is required
                if field.required:
                    errors.append(ErrorWrapper(MissingError(), loc=("body", field.alias)))
                else:
                    values[field.name] = deepcopy(field.default)
            else:
                if (
                    isinstance(field_info, params.File)
                    and lenient_issubclass(field.type_, bytes)
                    and isinstance(value, UploadFile)
                ):
                    value = await value.read()
                elif (
                    field.shape in sequence_shapes
                    and isinstance(field_info, params.File)
                    and lenient_issubclass(field.type_, bytes)
                    and all(isinstance(v, UploadFile) for v in value)
                ):
                    awaitables = [sub_value.read() for sub_value in value]
                    contents = await asyncio.gather(*awaitables)
                    # Convert the sequence back to the intended type (e.g., list, set)
                    value = sequence_shape_to_type[field.shape](contents)
                
                v_, errors_ = field.validate(value, values, loc=("body", field.alias))
                if isinstance(errors_, ErrorWrapper):
                    errors.append(errors_)
                elif isinstance(errors_, list):
                    errors.extend(errors_)
                else:
                    values[field.name] = v_
    
    return values, errors
```

By updating the logic to correctly handle sequences and their values in form data, the corrected function should address the issues and pass the failing test cases.
