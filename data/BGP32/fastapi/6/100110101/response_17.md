### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `request_body_to_args` is responsible for converting the received body data into arguments based on the required parameters. It processes the received data and extracts values based on field aliases.
2. The buggy function has issues with handling sequence-shaped fields like lists, sets, and tuples when they are received as FormData.
3. The failing tests are related to processing Python list, set, and tuple parameters received as Form data. The expected results are not being returned due to the bugs in the function.
4. The error in the function arises from not correctly handling sequence-shaped fields and not passing the correct values to the output, leading to status code 422 (Unprocessable Entity) instead of 200 (Success).
5. To fix the bug, we need to update the function to properly extract and convert sequence-shaped fields like lists, sets, and tuples from FormData into the desired format.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Check if the received data is a FormData instance and the field is sequence-shaped to properly handle list, set, and tuple fields.
2. Update the logic to extract values correctly for sequence-shaped fields from FormData.
3. Ensure that after extracting values, they are properly validated and returned in the expected format.

### Corrected Version of the function:

```python
async def request_body_to_args(
    required_params: List[ModelField],
    received_body: Optional[Union[Dict[str, Any], FormData]],
) -> Tuple[Dict[str, Any], List[ErrorWrapper]]:
    values = {}
    errors = []
    sequence_shapes = {2, 3}
    sequence_types = (list, set, tuple)
    for field in required_params:
        field_info = get_field_info(field)
        value: Any = None
        if received_body is not None:
            if field.shape in sequence_shapes and isinstance(received_body, FormData):
                value = received_body.getlist(field.alias)
            else:
                value = received_body.get(field.alias)
        if value is None or (isinstance(field_info, params.Form) and value == ""):
            if field.required:
                errors.append(ErrorWrapper(MissingError(), loc=("body", field.alias)))
            else:
                values[field.name] = deepcopy(field.default)
            continue
        if (
            isinstance(field_info, params.File)
            and lenient_issubclass(field.type_, bytes)
            and isinstance(value, UploadFile)
        ):
            value = await value.read()

        v_, errors_ = field.validate(value, values, loc=("body", field.alias))
        if isinstance(errors_, ErrorWrapper):
            errors.append(errors_)
        elif isinstance(errors_, list):
            errors.extend(errors_)
        elif value is not None:  # Avoid overriding values for missing non-required fields
            values[field.name] = v_

    return values, errors
```

This corrected version of the function includes changes to properly handle sequence-shaped fields received as FormData and ensures that the correct values are extracted and placed in the output dictionary. This version should pass the failing tests and return the expected output values in the specified cases.
