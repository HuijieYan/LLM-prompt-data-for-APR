### Analysis
The buggy function `request_body_to_args` is responsible for extracting values from a received body based on required parameters. The function processes the received body data and determines if it meets the required conditions specified by the `ModelField` objects in the `required_params` list.

The function has several potential issues that could lead to incorrect behavior:
1. Handling of single fields without embedding in a dict may not be done correctly.
2. Validation of form fields may have issues, especially related to sequences and file uploads.
3. Incorrect consideration of field shapes and types could lead to unexpected behaviors.
4. Error handling might not be appropriately capturing missing errors.

The failing tests are related to endpoints that receive data as lists, sets, and tuples, causing the function to extract the values from the form data incorrectly or produce errors.

### Bug Explanation
The failing tests indicate that the function is not processing the received form data correctly for parameters defined as lists, sets, or tuples. This inaccurate processing leads to error responses with a status code of 422 instead of the expected 200.

The cause of the bug lies in how the function handles the received data for these non-typing sequences. It fails to correctly assign the values to the `values` dictionary while processing list, set, or tuple fields, leading to an incorrect response status.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug:
1. Ensure that the function correctly interprets and processes the received form data for non-typing sequence fields (lists, sets, tuples).
2. Update the logic to handle these non-typing sequence fields appropriately by extracting and assigning the values correctly to the `values` dictionary.
3. Verify that error handling and status code responses are accurately managed for different field shapes and types.

By addressing these key points in the bug fix, the function should return the expected values and statuses for the failing test cases.

### Bug-free Function
Here is the corrected version of the `request_body_to_args` function:

```python
async def request_body_to_args(
    required_params: List[ModelField],
    received_body: Optional[Union[Dict[str, Any], FormData]],
) -> Tuple[Dict[str, Any], List[ErrorWrapper]]:
    values = {}
    errors = []
    if required_params:
        for field in required_params:
            value: Any = None
            if received_body is not None:
                if field.shape in [1, 2, 3]:  # Check if the field shape is for a sequence
                    value = received_body.getlist(field.alias)
                else:
                    value = received_body.get(field.alias)
            if value is None or (value == "" and field.required) or len(value) == 0:
                if field.required:
                    errors.append(ErrorWrapper(MissingError(), loc=("body", field.alias)))
                else:
                    values[field.name] = deepcopy(field.default)
            else:
                v_, errors_ = field.validate(value, values, loc=("body", field.alias))
                if isinstance(errors_, ErrorWrapper):
                    errors.append(errors_)
                elif isinstance(errors_, list):
                    errors.extend(errors_)
                else:
                    values[field.name] = v_
    return values, errors
```

This corrected version includes modifications to properly handle non-typing sequence fields within the `request_body_to_args` function, ensuring the necessary values are extracted and processed correctly.
