1. The function `request_body_to_args` is designed to convert request body data into arguments based on required parameters. It handles different scenarios for different types of fields such as Form fields and File fields.

2. One potential error location is the handling of sequence shapes and whether the received body is a `FormData` object. There might be an issue with how the function retrieves values from the received body.

3. The cause of the bug in the failing test scenarios is likely related to how the function handles sequence shapes and forms as input data. The function may not correctly extract the values from the received body when dealing with Python lists, sets, or tuples.

4. One strategy for fixing the bug is to ensure that the function correctly processes the input data for the required parameters that represent non-typing sequences. This involves correctly extracting values from the received body and handling sequence shapes appropriately.

## Corrected Version of the buggy function

```python
async def request_body_to_args(
    required_params: List[ModelField],
    received_body: Optional[Union[Dict[str, Any], FormData]],
) -> Tuple[Dict[str, Any], List[ErrorWrapper]]:
    values = {}
    errors = []
    if required_params:
        for field in required_params:
            value: Any = None
            if received_body is not None:
                if field.shape in sequence_shapes and isinstance(received_body, FormData):
                    value = received_body.getlist(field.alias)
                else:
                    value = received_body.get(field.alias)
            if (
                value is None
                or (isinstance(field_info, params.Form) and value == "")
                or (
                    isinstance(field_info, params.Form)
                    and field.shape in sequence_shapes
                    and len(value) == 0
                )
            ):
                if field.required:
                    if PYDANTIC_1:
                        errors.append(ErrorWrapper(MissingError(), loc=("body", field.alias)))
                    else:
                        errors.append(ErrorWrapper(MissingError(), loc=("body", field.alias), config=BaseConfig))
                else:
                    values[field.name] = deepcopy(field.default)
            else:
                v_, errors_ = field.validate(value, values, loc=("body", field.alias))
                if isinstance(errors_, ErrorWrapper):
                    errors.append(errors_)
                elif isinstance(errors_, list):
                    errors.extend(errors_)
                else:
                    values[field.name] = v_

    return values, errors
```

With the corrected version of the function, it should correctly handle the extraction of values from the received body for non-typing sequences and pass the failing tests provided.
