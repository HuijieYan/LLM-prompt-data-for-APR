## Analysis:
1. The buggy function `request_body_to_args` is responsible for converting the body of a request into arguments based on required parameters.
2. The function iterates over the required parameters and attempts to extract them from the received body.
3. The bug may arise from the handling of sequence shapes like lists, sets, and tuples which might not be processed correctly.
4. The current implementation may not handle the conversion of sequences properly, leading to errors in extracting values from the received body.

## Bug Cause:
The bug is caused by the incorrect handling of sequence shapes in the `request_body_to_args` function. When a sequence shape is encountered (e.g., list, set, tuple), the function does not appropriately validate and process the values in the received body, leading to incorrect results and failing test cases.

## Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Identify the sequence shapes correctly and handle them appropriately to extract values from the received body.
2. Validate the values within sequences and process them accordingly to generate the correct arguments for the required parameters.
3. Update the logic to handle sequence shapes like lists, sets, and tuples efficiently to pass the failing test cases.

## Corrected Function:
```python
async def request_body_to_args(
    required_params: List[ModelField],
    received_body: Optional[Union[Dict[str, Any], FormData]],
) -> Tuple[Dict[str, Any], List[ErrorWrapper]]:
    values = {}
    errors = []
    if required_params:
        for field in required_params:
            value: Any = None
            if received_body is not None:
                field_info = get_field_info(field)
                if field.shape in sequence_shapes and isinstance(
                    received_body, FormData
                ):
                    if field.shape == "list":
                        value = received_body.getlist(field.alias)
                    elif field.shape == "set":
                        value = set(received_body.getlist(field.alias))
                    elif field.shape == "tuple":
                        value = tuple(received_body.getlist(field.alias))
                else:
                    value = received_body.get(field.alias)

            if value is None and field.required:
                if PYDANTIC_1:
                    errors.append(
                        ErrorWrapper(MissingError(), loc=("body", field.alias))
                    )
                else:
                    errors.append(
                        ErrorWrapper(
                            MissingError(),
                            loc=("body", field.alias),
                            config=BaseConfig,
                        )
                    )
            else:
                if isinstance(field_info, params.File) and lenient_issubclass(
                    field.type_, bytes
                ) and isinstance(value, UploadFile):
                    value = await value.read()

                v_, errors_ = field.validate(value, values, loc=("body", field.alias))
                if isinstance(errors_, ErrorWrapper):
                    errors.append(errors_)
                elif isinstance(errors_, list):
                    errors.extend(errors_)
                else:
                    values[field.name] = v_

    return values, errors
```

In the corrected version of the `request_body_to_args` function:
- Proper handling of sequence shapes like lists, sets, and tuples has been implemented.
- Values within sequences are processed correctly based on the specified shape.
- Validation and extraction from the received body have been improved to address the bug related to non-typing sequences.

This corrected version should now pass the failing test cases mentioned earlier.
