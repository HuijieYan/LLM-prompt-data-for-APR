### Analysis:
- The `request_body_to_args` function is designed to extract values from the received body based on the list of required parameters.
- It is intended to handle cases where the body data is received in different formats (FormData or Dict).
- The function iterates over the required parameters and processes each one to extract the corresponding value from the body data.

### Potential Error Locations:
1. The condition check for field shape in sequence_shapes.
2. The handling of params.File type fields.
3. The validation and processing of values for each field.

### Bug Explanation:
The bug in the provided function is likely related to how it processes sequences of values when the field shape is identified as a sequence shape. This incorrect processing leads to incorrect extraction and handling of values in certain scenarios.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Update the logic for handling sequence shape fields to correctly extract and process the values.
2. Ensure that when dealing with sequences, the function properly extracts and validates all individual values in the sequence.
3. Check the conditionals related to file type fields to ensure correct handling of file uploads.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
async def request_body_to_args(
    required_params: List[ModelField],
    received_body: Optional[Union[Dict[str, Any], FormData]],
) -> Tuple[Dict[str, Any], List[ErrorWrapper]]:
    values = {}
    errors = []
    for field in required_params:
        value: Any = None
        if received_body is not None:
            if field.shape in sequence_shapes and isinstance(received_body, FormData):
                value = received_body.getlist(field.alias)
            else:
                value = received_body.get(field.alias)
        if value is None or (isinstance(field_info, params.Form) and not value):
            if field.required:
                errors.append(ErrorWrapper(MissingError(), loc=("body", field.alias))
            values[field.name] = value
        if isinstance(field_info, params.File) and lenient_issubclass(field.type_, bytes):
            if isinstance(value, UploadFile):
                value = await value.read()
            elif field.shape in sequence_shapes and isinstance(value, sequence_types):
                awaitables = [sub_value.read() for sub_value in value]
                contents = await asyncio.gather(*awaitables)
                value = sequence_shape_to_type[field.shape](contents)

        v_, errors_ = field.validate(value, values, loc=("body", field.alias))
        if isinstance(errors_, ErrorWrapper):
            errors.append(errors_)
        elif isinstance(errors_, list):
            errors.extend(errors_)
        else:
            values[field.name] = v_
    return values, errors
```

This corrected version simplifies the logic for handling sequence shapes and properly processes values based on the field's type and shape. By addressing the issues in value extraction, validation, and processing, the function should now be able to handle the provided test cases and similar scenarios without errors.
