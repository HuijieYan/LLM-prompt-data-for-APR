### Analysis:
The buggy function `request_body_to_args` is designed to convert a received request body into arguments based on a list of required parameters. The function handles different shapes and types of fields that may be present in the body.

### Identified Bug:
The bug lies in the handling of sequences in the request body. Specifically, the function does not correctly handle Python lists, sets, and tuples when they are passed as form data. This results in incorrect and inconsistent behavior during validation and processing of the request body parameters.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is caused by the function not properly handling different sequence types like lists, sets, and tuples when they are passed as form data. This causes the validation process to fail and return incorrect responses.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to modify the logic within the `request_body_to_args` function to correctly handle Python lists, sets, and tuples that are passed as form data. This involves ensuring that the function can correctly extract the values from these sequences and handle their validation appropriately.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
async def request_body_to_args(
    required_params: List[ModelField],
    received_body: Optional[Union[Dict[str, Any], FormData]],
) -> Tuple[Dict[str, Any], List[ErrorWrapper]]:
    values = {}
    errors = []
    for field in required_params:
        alias = field.alias
        value = None
        if received_body is not None:
            if field.shape in sequence_shapes and isinstance(received_body, FormData):
                value = received_body.getlist(alias)
            else:
                value = received_body.get(alias)
        if value is None:
            if field.required:
                if PYDANTIC_1:
                    errors.append(ErrorWrapper(MissingError(), loc=("body", alias)))
                else:
                    errors.append(
                        ErrorWrapper(MissingError(), loc=("body", alias), config=BaseConfig)
                    )
            else:
                values[field.name] = deepcopy(field.default)
            continue
        if isinstance(field_info, params.File) and lenient_issubclass(field.type_, bytes):
            if isinstance(value, UploadFile):
                value = await value.read()
            elif isinstance(value, (list, set, tuple)) and all(isinstance(item, UploadFile) for item in value):
                value = [await item.read() for item in value]
        v, errors_ = field.validate(value, values, loc=("body", alias))
        if isinstance(errors_, ErrorWrapper):
            errors.append(errors_)
        elif isinstance(errors_, list):
            errors.extend(errors_)
        else:
            values[field.name] = v
    return values, errors
```

This corrected version of the `request_body_to_args` function includes updated logic for handling Python lists, sets, and tuples correctly when passed as form data. It ensures that the values are read and processed appropriately based on their types. This should allow the function to pass the failing test cases provided.
