### Analysis:
The `request_body_to_args` function is responsible for converting received request body data into arguments based on the required parameters specified. There are potential error locations within the function related to handling sequences like lists, sets, and tuples. Specifically, the current implementation does not handle nested sequences properly, leading to errors in the provided tests which expect the function to correctly handle Python list, set, and tuple parameters.

### Bug Cause:
The bug in the `request_body_to_args` function is due to the incorrect handling of nested sequences. When receiving a nested sequence (e.g., a list within another list), the current implementation fails to properly process it, resulting in errors when extracting and validating the values.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to adjust the logic in the function to correctly handle nested sequences, especially in cases where the shape is a sequence and the type is not a file. This involves iterating through nested sequences and properly extracting and validating their contents.

### Corrected Function:
Here is the corrected version of the `request_body_to_args` function:

```python
async def request_body_to_args(
    required_params: List[ModelField],
    received_body: Optional[Union[Dict[str, Any], FormData]],
) -> Tuple[Dict[str, Any], List[ErrorWrapper]]:
    values = {}
    errors = []
    if required_params:
        for field in required_params:
            field_info = get_field_info(field)
            if received_body is not None:
                if field.shape in sequence_shapes and isinstance(received_body, FormData):
                    value = received_body.getlist(field.alias)
                else:
                    value = received_body.get(field.alias)

                if value is not None and field.shape in sequence_shapes and field_info.type_ not in (type(None), UploadFile):
                    if not isinstance(value, list):
                        value = [value]
                    
                    awaitables = [field.validate(sub_value, values, loc=("body", field.alias)) for sub_value in value]
                    results = await asyncio.gather(*awaitables)

                    for v_, errors_ in results:
                        if isinstance(errors_, ErrorWrapper):
                            errors.append(errors_)
                        elif isinstance(errors_, list):
                            errors.extend(errors_)
                        else:
                            values[field.name] = v_
                else:
                    if field.required and value is None:
                        errors.append(ErrorWrapper(MissingError(), loc=("body", field.alias))
                    else:
                        values[field.name] = value
        
    return values, errors
```

By making the adjustments outlined above, the corrected function should now properly handle nested sequences and pass the failing tests provided.
