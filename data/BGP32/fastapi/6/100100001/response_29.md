### Analysis:
The buggy function `request_body_to_args` is responsible for converting received body data into arguments based on the required parameters specified. However, the bug seems to arise from the handling of sequence shapes such as lists, sets, and tuples within the received body.

### Identified Bug:
The bug in the function lies in the incorrect handling of sequence shapes when processing the received body data. Specifically, the function fails to appropriately extract values for sequence-shaped fields like lists, sets, and tuples.

### Cause of the Bug:
1. The function does not handle sequence shapes adequately, leading to incorrect extraction and validation of values for fields like lists, sets, and tuples.
2. This inadequate handling results in errors and incorrect output when processing fields that are supposed to contain sequence data.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that sequence shapes like lists, sets, and tuples within the received body are properly processed. This involves correctly extracting and validating values based on the type of sequence-shaped field.

### Corrected Version:
```python
async def request_body_to_args(
    required_params: List[ModelField],
    received_body: Optional[Union[Dict[str, Any], FormData]],
) -> Tuple[Dict[str, Any], List[ErrorWrapper]]:
    values = {}
    errors = []
    for field in required_params:
        value: Any = None
        if received_body is not None:
            sequence_shapes = {list, set, tuple}
            if field.shape in sequence_shapes and isinstance(
                received_body, FormData
            ):
                value = received_body.getlist(field.alias)
            else:
                value = received_body.get(field.alias)

        if value is None and field.required:
            if PYDANTIC_1:
                errors.append(
                    ErrorWrapper(MissingError(), loc=("body", field.alias))
                )
            else:
                errors.append(
                    ErrorWrapper(  # type: ignore
                        MissingError(),
                        loc=("body", field.alias),
                        config=BaseConfig,
                    )
                )
        elif lenient_issubclass(field.type_, (list, set, tuple)):
            value = field.sub_fields[0].validate(value, None, loc=("body", field.alias))
        else:
            v_, errors_ = field.validate(value, values, loc=("body", field.alias))
            if isinstance(errors_, ErrorWrapper):
                errors.append(errors_)
            elif isinstance(errors_, list):
                errors.extend(errors_)
            else:
                values[field.name] = v_
    return values, errors
```

This corrected version makes use of the `sequence_shapes` set to determine how to extract values for sequence-shaped fields correctly. It also ensures proper validation and handling of such fields based on their type. This should address the bug and enable the function to process sequence-shaped data from the received body accurately.
