### Analysis:
- The `request_body_to_args` function is responsible for extracting values from the received body based on the required parameters provided.
- The function seems to have issues handling certain cases related to sequence data types and file uploads.

### Identified Potential Error Locations:
1. The condition to extract values for sequence shaped fields may not be implemented correctly.
2. Handling of file uploads and sequence shape fields together may lead to incorrect behavior.

### Bug Explanation:
- The current implementation does not correctly handle extracting values for sequence shaped fields like lists, sets, tuples from the received body.
- It may lead to errors or unexpected behavior when dealing with sequence shaped fields and file uploads together.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
1. Update the logic for extracting values for sequence shaped fields in the `request_body_to_args` function.
2. Ensure proper handling of file uploads and sequence shaped fields separately.
3. Correctly validate and process the values for different types of fields to avoid errors.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
async def request_body_to_args(
    required_params: List[ModelField],
    received_body: Optional[Union[Dict[str, Any], FormData]],
) -> Tuple[Dict[str, Any], List[ErrorWrapper]]:
    values = {}
    errors = []
    for field in required_params:
        value = None
        if received_body is not None:
            if field.shape in sequence_shapes and isinstance(received_body, FormData):
                value = received_body.getlist(field.alias)
            else:
                value = received_body.get(field.alias)
            if value is None:
                if field.required:
                    errors.append(ErrorWrapper(MissingError(), loc=("body", field.alias)))
                else:
                    values[field.name] = deepcopy(field.default)
                continue
                
            if isinstance(field_info, params.File) and lenient_issubclass(field.type_, bytes) and isinstance(value, UploadFile):
                value = await value.read()
                
            v_, errors_ = field.validate(value, values, loc=("body", field.alias))
            if isinstance(errors_, ErrorWrapper):
                errors.append(errors_)
            elif isinstance(errors_, list):
                errors.extend(errors_)
            else:
                values[field.name] = v_
    
    return values, errors
```

### Summary of Changes:
- Updated the logic for extracting values for sequence shaped fields.
- Separated the handling of file uploads from other field types.
- Corrected the validation and processing of values for fields.

This corrected version of the function should address the identified issues and ensure proper extraction and processing of values from the received body.
