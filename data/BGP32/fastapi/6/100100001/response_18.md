### Analysis:
- The `request_body_to_args` function is responsible for converting request body parameters into arguments to be used in FastAPI's endpoint functions.
- The function iterates over the required parameters and retrieves their values from the received body.
- It handles different cases based on the type of the parameter (File, Form, etc.), validates the values, and populates the `values` dictionary.
- The function also collects any errors that occur during the process in the `errors` list.

### Issues identified:
1. The function doesn't handle parameters that are in the form of lists correctly. It fails to parse them properly when the parameters are sent as form data.
2. The function may not correctly handle parameters that are in the form of sets or tuples as well due to the same reason as with lists.

### Bug Explanation:
The issue stems from the handling of parameters which are supposed to be sequence types (lists, sets, tuples). The function fails to correctly retrieve and process these sequence-based parameters when provided as form data. As a result, the function doesn't properly validate and construct the values, leading to incorrect output or errors in the responses during tests.

### Strategy for fixing the bug:
To correct the bug:
- Check the logic for retrieving sequence-based parameters from the request body.
- Ensure that the values for sequence-based parameters are correctly extracted when provided as form data.
- Update the validation and processing of sequence-based parameters.
- Modify the logic to handle lists, sets, and tuples appropriately.

### Corrected Version of the function:
```python
async def request_body_to_args(
    required_params: List[ModelField],
    received_body: Optional[Union[Dict[str, Any], FormData]],
) -> Tuple[Dict[str, Any], List[ErrorWrapper]]:
    values = {}
    errors = []
    
    sequence_shapes = ["sequence", "set", "list", "tuple"]
    
    for field in required_params:
        value: Any = None
        if received_body is not None:
            if field.shape in sequence_shapes and isinstance(received_body, FormData):
                value = received_body.getlist(field.alias)
            else:
                value = received_body.get(field.alias)

        if value is None or (isinstance(field_info, params.Form) and value == "") or (
            isinstance(field_info, params.Form) and field.shape in sequence_shapes and len(value) == 0
        ):
            if field.required:
                errors.append(ErrorWrapper(MissingError(), loc=("body", field.alias)))
            else:
                values[field.alias] = field.default
            continue

        if isinstance(field_info, params.File) and lenient_issubclass(field.type_, bytes) and isinstance(value, UploadFile):
            value = await value.read()
        elif field.shape in sequence_shapes and isinstance(field_info, params.File) and lenient_issubclass(field.type_, bytes) and isinstance(value, sequence_types):
            awaitables = [sub_value.read() for sub_value in value]
            contents = await asyncio.gather(*awaitables)
            value = sequence_shape_to_type[field.shape](contents) if field.shape == "list" else set(contents)

        v_, errors_ = field.validate(value, values, loc=("body", field.alias))
        if isinstance(errors_, ErrorWrapper):
            errors.append(errors_)
        elif isinstance(errors_, list):
            errors.extend(errors_)
        else:
            values[field.name] = v_
        
    return values, errors
```

This corrected version of the function should now handle sequence-based parameters (such as lists, sets, tuples) correctly when provided as form data payloads. This should resolve the issues faced in the failing tests related to sequence-based parameters.
