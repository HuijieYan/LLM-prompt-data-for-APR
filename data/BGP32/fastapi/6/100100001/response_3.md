## Analysis:
The buggy function `request_body_to_args` is responsible for extracting values from a request body based on required parameters and handling errors if necessary. The function iterates over the required parameters, retrieves the corresponding values from the received body, and validates them against the field information. However, there is an issue when processing sequence shapes (like lists, sets, tuples) from the received body, leading to incorrect extraction and validation.

## Issue:
The bug arises when the function encounters a field with a sequence shape (e.g., list, set, tuple) and tries to extract the value from the received body. In the case of sequence shapes, the function incorrectly handles the extraction and validation process, resulting in errors like failing the tests mentioned earlier.

## Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
1. Modify the extraction logic for sequence shapes in the received body to ensure correct handling of lists, sets, and tuples.
2. Update the validation process to correctly validate the extracted values against the field information.
3. Make necessary adjustments to handle sequence shapes based on the field information to pass the failing tests.

## Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
async def request_body_to_args(
    required_params: List[ModelField],
    received_body: Optional[Union[Dict[str, Any], FormData]],
) -> Tuple[Dict[str, Any], List[ErrorWrapper]]:
    values = {}
    errors = []
    if required_params:
        for field in required_params:
            value: Any = None
            if received_body is not None:
                if isinstance(field_info, params.Form) and field.shape in sequence_shapes:
                    value = received_body.getlist(field.alias)
                else:
                    value = received_body.get(field.alias)
                
            if (
                value is None
                or (isinstance(field_info, params.Form) and value == "")
                or (
                    isinstance(field_info, params.Form)
                    and field.shape in sequence_shapes
                    and len(value) == 0
                )
            ):
                if field.required:
                    if PYDANTIC_1:
                        errors.append(
                            ErrorWrapper(MissingError(), loc=("body", field.alias))
                        )
                    else:  # pragma: nocover
                        errors.append(
                            ErrorWrapper(  # type: ignore
                                MissingError(),
                                loc=("body", field.alias),
                                config=BaseConfig,
                            )
                        )
                else:
                    values[field.name] = deepcopy(field.default)
                continue
            
            v_, errors_ = field.validate(value, values, loc=("body", field.alias))
            if isinstance(errors_, ErrorWrapper):
                errors.append(errors_)
            elif isinstance(errors_, list):
                errors.extend(errors_)
            else:
                values[field.name] = v_
    return values, errors
```

By making these corrections in the function, it should now be able to correctly handle sequence shapes in the request body and pass the failing tests provided earlier.
