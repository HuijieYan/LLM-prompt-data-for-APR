### Analysis:
The buggy function `request_body_to_args` is responsible for extracting values from the received body based on the required parameters specified. It also handles validation and error reporting for missing or invalid values.

### Identified Error Locations:
1. The condition `if field.shape in sequence_shapes` is used to identify sequence-shaped fields, but `sequence_shapes` is not defined in the provided code snippet.
2. The handling of sequence-shaped fields, specifically for `params.File` and when `lenient_issubclass` is true, is causing issues with validation and extraction.
3. The logic for handling embedded fields might be incorrect as it tries to wrap the received body when only one required parameter is present.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is likely due to improper handling and validation of sequence-shaped fields, including lists, sets, and tuples, in the `request_body_to_args` function. The incorrect extraction and validation of these values lead to the failing test cases.

### Fix Strategy:
1. Define `sequence_shapes` based on the supported sequence types like lists, sets, and tuples.
2. Update the extraction and validation logic for sequence-shaped fields to correctly handle different sequence types.
3. Check for proper embedding logic and adjust as necessary to avoid incorrect wrapping.

### Corrected Version:

```python
async def request_body_to_args(
    required_params: List[ModelField],
    received_body: Optional[Union[Dict[str, Any], FormData]],
) -> Tuple[Dict[str, Any], List[ErrorWrapper]]:
    values = {}
    errors = []
    
    sequence_shapes = {List, Set, Tuple}
    sequence_types = (list, set, tuple)
    
    if required_params:
        if len(required_params) == 1 and not hasattr(get_field_info(required_params[0]), "embed"):
            received_body = {required_params[0].alias: received_body} if received_body is not None else {}

        for field in required_params:
            value: Any = None
            if received_body is not None:
                if hasattr(field, "shape") and field.shape in sequence_shapes and isinstance(received_body, FormData):
                    value = received_body.getlist(field.alias)
                else:
                    value = received_body.get(field.alias)
            
            if value is None or (isinstance(get_field_info(field), params.Form) and value == "") or (
                isinstance(get_field_info(field), params.Form) and hasattr(field, "shape") and field.shape in sequence_shapes and len(value) == 0
            ):
                if field.required:
                    errors.append(ErrorWrapper(MissingError(), loc=("body", field.alias))
                else:
                    values[field.name] = deepcopy(field.default)
                continue

            v_, errors_ = field.validate(value, values, loc=("body", field.alias))
            if isinstance(errors_, ErrorWrapper):
                errors.append(errors_)
            elif isinstance(errors_, list):
                errors.extend(errors_)
            else:
                values[field.name] = v_

    return values, errors
```

This corrected version includes the necessary adjustments to handle sequence-shaped fields correctly and addresses the identified error locations. It should now pass the failing test cases related to Python lists, sets, and tuples passed as form data.
