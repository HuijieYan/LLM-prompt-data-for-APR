### Analysis:
The buggy function `request_body_to_args` is responsible for extracting values from a received body based on required parameters and handling different cases such as files, sequences, and missing values. The function iterates over the required parameters, extracts the corresponding values from the received body, and validates them against the field information.

### Error Location:
One potential error location is when the function encounters a sequence type field (e.g., List, Set, Tuple) and tries to extract the values from the FormData. The current implementation does not handle such cases correctly, leading to issues when processing sequences.

### Bug Explanation:
The bug occurs when the function attempts to extract sequence values from FormData. The code does not properly handle this case, resulting in incorrect value extraction or validation failures when dealing with non-typing sequences like lists, sets, or tuples.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to adjust the logic for extracting sequence values from FormData based on the field shape. Additionally, proper handling of non-typing sequences as form parameters should be implemented to ensure correct value extraction and validation.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
Here is the corrected version of the `request_body_to_args` function:

```python
async def request_body_to_args(
    required_params: List[ModelField],
    received_body: Optional[Union[Dict[str, Any], FormData]],
) -> Tuple[Dict[str, Any], List[ErrorWrapper]]:
    values = {}
    errors = []

    for field in required_params:
        value: Any = None
        if received_body is not None:
            if field.shape in sequence_shapes and isinstance(received_body, FormData):
                value = received_body.getlist(field.alias)
            else:
                value = received_body.get(field.alias)
        
        if value is None or value == "":
            if field.required:
                errors.append(
                    ErrorWrapper(MissingError(), loc=("body", field.alias))
                )
            else:
                values[field.name] = deepcopy(field.default)
            continue
        
        if (
            isinstance(field_info, params.File)
            and lenient_issubclass(field.type_, bytes)
            and isinstance(value, UploadFile)
        ):
            value = await value.read()
        
        v_, errors_ = field.validate(value, values, loc=("body", field.alias))
        if isinstance(errors_, ErrorWrapper):
            errors.append(errors_)
        elif isinstance(errors_, list):
            errors.extend(errors_)
        else:
            values[field.name] = v_
    
    return values, errors
```

This corrected version ensures that sequence values are properly extracted from FormData and handled according to the field information. This should allow the function to correctly process non-typing sequences as form parameters and pass the failing tests.
