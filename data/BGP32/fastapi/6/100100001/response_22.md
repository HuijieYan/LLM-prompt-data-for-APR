## Analysis:
The `request_body_to_args` function is designed to extract values from the received body based on the required parameters specified. The bug might be related to how the function handles sequence shapes like lists, sets, and tuples.

## Bug Explanation:
The bug occurs when the function tries to extract values for sequence shapes like lists, sets, and tuples from the received body. The current implementation does not handle these sequence shapes correctly, leading to errors in extracting and parsing the values.

## Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to update the logic for extracting values for sequence shapes such as lists, sets, and tuples from the received body. We should ensure that the function correctly processes these sequence shapes and handles them appropriately to avoid errors.

## Corrected Version:
```python
async def request_body_to_args(
    required_params: List[ModelField],
    received_body: Optional[Union[Dict[str, Any], FormData]],
) -> Tuple[Dict[str, Any], List[ErrorWrapper]]:
    values = {}
    errors = []
    if required_params:
        for field in required_params:
            value: Any = None
            if received_body is not None:
                value = received_body.get(field.alias)
                if (
                    value is None
                    or (isinstance(field_info, params.Form) and value == "")
                    or (
                        isinstance(field_info, params.Form)
                        and field.shape in sequence_shapes
                        and len(value) == 0
                    )
                ):
                    if field.required:
                        if PYDANTIC_1:
                            errors.append(
                                ErrorWrapper(MissingError(), loc=("body", field.alias))
                            )
                        else:
                            errors.append(
                                ErrorWrapper(MissingError(), loc=("body", field.alias), config=BaseConfig)
                            )
                    else:
                        values[field.name] = deepcopy(field.default)
                    continue
                
                if isinstance(field_info, params.File) and isinstance(value, UploadFile):
                    value = await value.read()
                elif field.shape in sequence_shapes and isinstance(value, sequence_types):
                    awaitables = [sub_value.read() for sub_value in value]
                    contents = await asyncio.gather(*awaitables)
                    value = sequence_shape_to_type[field.shape](contents)
                
                v_, errors_ = field.validate(value, values, loc=("body", field.alias))
                if isinstance(errors_, ErrorWrapper):
                    errors.append(errors_)
                elif isinstance(errors_, list):
                    errors.extend(errors_)
                else:
                    values[field.name] = v_
    return values, errors
```

After applying the corrections, the `request_body_to_args` function should now correctly handle sequence shapes like lists, sets, and tuples from the received body and parse them accordingly. This corrected version is expected to pass the failing tests provided.
