### Bug Explanation:
The bug in the `request_body_to_args` function occurs when handling non-typing sequences like lists, sets, and tuples in the request body. The function incorrectly treats these sequences as individual values, leading to errors in validation and processing. This results in the failing tests for Python list, set, and tuple inputs.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to modify the logic in the `request_body_to_args` function to properly handle non-typing sequences when they are passed as form data. Specifically, we need to extract the sequence values from the form data and correctly process them before validation.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
Here is the corrected version of the `request_body_to_args` function:

```python
async def request_body_to_args(
    required_params: List[ModelField],
    received_body: Optional[Union[Dict[str, Any], FormData]],
) -> Tuple[Dict[str, Any], List[ErrorWrapper]]:
    values = {}
    errors = []
    if required_params:
        if isinstance(received_body, FormData):
            for field in required_params:
                value: Any = received_body.getlist(field.alias)
                v_, errors_ = field.validate(value, values, loc=("body", field.alias))
                if isinstance(errors_, ErrorWrapper):
                    errors.append(errors_)
                elif isinstance(errors_, list):
                    errors.extend(errors_)
                else:
                    values[field.name] = v_
    return values, errors
```

By extracting the values of non-typing sequences correctly from the form data and validating them according to the field's type, the corrected function should now handle Python list, set, and tuple inputs properly, passing the failing tests.
