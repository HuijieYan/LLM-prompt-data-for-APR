The buggy function `request_body_to_args` is designed to extract values from a request body based on the provided required parameters. However, the function is not handling sequences properly and is causing errors when receiving non-list values for list, set, and tuple types.

The main issue lies in how the function handles sequences, specifically when processing values for list, set, and tuple types. The current implementation checks the `shape` of the field to determine if the value should be retrieved as a list or a single value, but this logic is incorrect for non-list sequence types.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the logic for extracting and validating sequence values based on the field type. We should ensure that if the field type is a list, set, or tuple, the function extracts the entire sequence from the request body correctly.

Here is the corrected version of the `request_body_to_args` function:

```python
async def request_body_to_args(
    required_params: List[ModelField],
    received_body: Optional[Union[Dict[str, Any], FormData]],
) -> Tuple[Dict[str, Any], List[ErrorWrapper]]:
    values = {}
    errors = []
    if required_params:
        for field in required_params:
            value: Any = None
            if received_body is not None:
                if field.shape in sequence_shapes and isinstance(
                    received_body, FormData
                ):
                    value = received_body.getlist(field.alias)
                else:
                    value = received_body.get(field.alias)
            
            if value is not None:
                if isinstance(field_info, params.File) and lenient_issubclass(field.type_, bytes) and isinstance(value, UploadFile):
                    value = await value.read()
                elif field.shape in sequence_shapes and isinstance(value, sequence_types):
                    if isinstance(field.type_, list):
                        value = [item[1] for item in value]
                    elif isinstance(field.type_, set):
                        value = {item[1] for item in value}
                    elif isinstance(field.type_, tuple):
                        value = tuple(item[1] for item in value)
            
            v_, errors_ = field.validate(value, values, loc=("body", field.alias))
            if isinstance(errors_, ErrorWrapper):
                errors.append(errors_)
            elif isinstance(errors_, list):
                errors.extend(errors_)
            else:
                values[field.name] = v_
    
    return values, errors
```

This corrected version of the function should now handle list, set, and tuple types correctly when extracting values from the request body. It ensures that the entire sequence is extracted and validated based on the field type provided.

After applying this fix, the function should be able to pass the failing tests `test_python_list_param_as_form`, `test_python_set_param_as_form`, and `test_python_tuple_param_as_form`.
