The buggy function `request_body_to_args` is designed to extract values from the received body based on required parameters and return a dictionary of values along with any errors encountered during extraction. The primary issue causing the failing tests is due to the incorrect handling of iterable types like lists, sets, and tuples in the `received_body`.

### Bug Identified:
The main issue lies in how the function handles sequence-shaped fields (like lists, sets, tuples) in the received body. The function does not correctly extract these values leading to errors in the validation process.

### Bug Cause:
1. The function treats sequence-shaped fields as singular values in the `received_body` leading to incorrect extraction and validation.
2. The function fails to differentiate between single values and sequences when processing the received body.
3. There is an inconsistency in value processing for Form fields and File fields.

### Fix Strategy:
To fix this bug, we need to adjust the logic within the function to correctly handle sequence-shaped fields in the `received_body`. Specifically, we need to identify when a field represents a sequence (e.g., list, set, tuple) and extract the corresponding values accordingly. Additionally, the function should distinguish between single values and sequences when processing the received body.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
Here is the corrected version of the `request_body_to_args` function:

```python
async def request_body_to_args(
    required_params: List[ModelField],
    received_body: Optional[Union[Dict[str, Any], FormData]],
) -> Tuple[Dict[str, Any], List[ErrorWrapper]]:
    values = {}
    errors = []

    for field in required_params:
        value: Any = None

        if received_body is not None:
            if field.shape in sequence_shapes and isinstance(received_body, FormData):
                if field.alias in received_body:
                    value = received_body.getlist(field.alias)
                else:
                    value = []
            else:
                value = received_body.get(field.alias)

        if value is None:
            if field.required:
                errors.append(ErrorWrapper(MissingError(), loc=("body", field.alias)))
            else:
                values[field.name] = deepcopy(field.default)
        else:
            if isinstance(field_info, params.File) and lenient_issubclass(field.type_, bytes):
                if isinstance(value, list) and all(isinstance(sub_val, UploadFile) for sub_val in value):
                    value = [await sub_val.read() for sub_val in value]
                elif isinstance(value, UploadFile):
                    value = await value.read()

            v_, errors_ = field.validate(value, values, loc=("body", field.alias))

            if isinstance(errors_, ErrorWrapper):
                errors.append(errors_)
            elif isinstance(errors_, list):
                errors.extend(errors_)
            else:
                values[field.name] = v_

    return values, errors

```

This corrected version of the function now properly handles sequence-shaped fields within the received body, allowing for correct extraction and validation. It distinguishes between single values and sequences, addressing the bug identified in the original implementation.
