The bug in the `request_body_to_args` function seems to stem from how it handles different shapes of fields (like list, set, tuple) in the received body. The function incorrectly assumes that all fields are lists and directly retrieves the value from the `received_body` without considering the shape.

To fix the bug, we need to modify how the function processes the received body based on the shape of the field. Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
from typing import List, Dict, Any, Union, Tuple

async def request_body_to_args(
    required_params: List[ModelField],
    received_body: Optional[Union[Dict[str, Any], FormData]],
) -> Tuple[Dict[str, Any], List[ErrorWrapper]]:
    values = {}
    errors = []
    if required_params:
        for field in required_params:
            value: Any = None
            if received_body is not None:
                if field.shape in sequence_shapes and isinstance(
                    received_body, FormData
                ):
                    if field.alias in received_body:
                        if field.shape == 1:
                            value = received_body.get(field.alias)
                        elif field.shape == 3:  # Set
                            value = set(received_body.getlist(field.alias))
                        elif field.shape == 4:  # Tuple
                            value = tuple(received_body.getlist(field.alias))
                else:
                    if field.alias in received_body:
                        value = received_body.get(field.alias)

            if (
                value is None
                or (isinstance(field_info, params.Form) and value == "")
                or (
                    isinstance(field_info, params.Form)
                    and field.shape in sequence_shapes
                    and len(value) == 0
                )
            ):
                if field.required:
                    if PYDANTIC_1:
                        errors.append(
                            ErrorWrapper(MissingError(), loc=("body", field.alias))
                        )
                    else:  # pragma: nocover
                        errors.append(
                            ErrorWrapper(
                                MissingError(),
                                loc=("body", field.alias),
                                config=BaseConfig,
                            )
                        )
                else:
                    values[field.name] = deepcopy(field.default)
                continue

            v_, errors_ = field.validate(value, values, loc=("body", field.alias))
            if isinstance(errors_, ErrorWrapper):
                errors.append(errors_)
            elif isinstance(errors_, list):
                errors.extend(errors_)
            else:
                values[field.name] = v_

    return values, errors
```

This modified version of the function correctly handles different shapes like list, set, and tuple when extracting values from the `received_body`. It checks the shape of the field and processes the data accordingly.

Please test the function against the failing test cases to ensure that the bug has been fixed and the function now behaves as expected.
