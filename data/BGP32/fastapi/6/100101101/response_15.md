From the analysis of the provided buggy function and the failing tests, the main issue seems to be related to how the function handles different types of sequences (list, set, tuple) passed in the request body. The function does not appropriately convert these sequences into the expected types.

To fix the bug, we need to update the logic in the `request_body_to_args` function to correctly handle list, set, and tuple types in the request body.

Here is the corrected version of the `request_body_to_args` function:

```python
async def request_body_to_args(
    required_params: List[ModelField],
    received_body: Optional[Union[Dict[str, Any], FormData]],
) -> Tuple[Dict[str, Any], List[ErrorWrapper]]:
    values = {}
    errors = []
    for field in required_params:
        value: Any = None
        if received_body is not None:
            if field.shape in sequence_shapes:
                if isinstance(received_body, FormData):
                    value = received_body.getlist(field.alias)
                else:
                    value = received_body.get(field.alias)
            else:
                value = received_body.get(field.alias)
        if value is None or (isinstance(field_info, params.Form) and value == ""):
            if field.required:
                errors.append(ErrorWrapper(MissingError(), loc=("body", field.alias)))
            else:
                values[field.name] = deepcopy(field.default)
        else:
            v_, errors_ = field.validate(value, values, loc=("body", field.alias))
            if isinstance(errors_, ErrorWrapper):
                errors.append(errors_)
            elif isinstance(errors_, list):
                errors.extend(errors_)
            else:
                values[field.name] = v_
    return values, errors
```

This corrected version simplifies the logic to correctly handle different sequence types and ensure the values are converted appropriately. Now, the function should be correctly able to process list, set, and tuple types in the request body.

Please test this corrected version with the failing tests to verify that the issue is resolved.
