### Bug Explanation
The bug in the `request_body_to_args` function lies in the handling of sequence-shaped fields (list, set, tuple) when passed in as form data. The current implementation fails to properly parse and validate multiple occurrences of the same key in the form data. As a result, only the last occurrence is considered, leading to validation errors and incorrect results.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, the function needs to be modified to correctly handle multiple occurrences of the same key in the form data. The goal is to aggregate all values associated with the same key into a list, set, or tuple (depending on the field type) before validation. This change will ensure that all values are properly considered during validation.

### Corrected Version of the Function
Here is the corrected version of the `request_body_to_args` function:

```python
async def request_body_to_args(
    required_params: List[ModelField],
    received_body: Optional[Union[Dict[str, Any], FormData]],
) -> Tuple[Dict[str, Any], List[ErrorWrapper]]:
    values = {}
    errors = []
    
    if received_body is None:
        received_body = {}
    
    for field in required_params:
        value: Any = None
        if received_body is not None:
            if field.shape in sequence_shapes and isinstance(received_body, FormData):
                values_list = received_body.getlist(field.alias)  # Get all values associated with the same key
                if field.shape == 3:  # For tuple, convert to tuple
                    value = tuple(values_list)
                elif field.shape == 4:  # For set, convert to set
                    value = set(values_list)
                else:  # For list
                    value = values_list
            else:
                value = received_body.get(field.alias)
                
        if value is None or (isinstance(field_info, params.Form) and value == ""):
            if field.required:
                errors.append(ErrorWrapper(MissingError(), loc=("body", field.alias)))
            else:
                values[field.name] = deepcopy(field.default)
        else:
            v_, errors_ = field.validate(value, values, loc=("body", field.alias))
            if isinstance(errors_, ErrorWrapper):
                errors.append(errors_)
            elif isinstance(errors_, list):
                errors.extend(errors_)
            else:
                values[field.name] = v_
            
    return values, errors
```

By adjusting the logic to properly handle multiple values associated with the same key, this corrected version should resolve the issue with form data containing repeated keys and ensure correct validation for fields of list, set, and tuple types.
