### Cause of the Bug
The bug is caused by how the function `request_body_to_args` handles request body data for non-typing sequences like list, set, and tuple. The bug prevents the function from correctly extracting and validating repeated keys in form data. This issue is related to the GitHub request, as it highlights the necessity of handling repeated keys in form data.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug
To fix the bug, we need to modify the logic in the `request_body_to_args` function to correctly handle repeated keys in form data and extract them into Python lists, sets, or tuples for validation. By updating the logic, we can ensure that the function processes repeated keys as expected and passes the failing tests.

### Corrected Version of the Function
Here is the corrected version of the `request_body_to_args` function:

```python
async def request_body_to_args(
    required_params: List[ModelField],
    received_body: Optional[Union[Dict[str, Any], FormData]],
) -> Tuple[Dict[str, Any], List[ErrorWrapper]]:
    values = {}
    errors = []
    if required_params and received_body:
        for field in required_params:
            value = received_body.getlist(field.alias)
            if not value:
                if field.required:
                    errors.append(ErrorWrapper(MissingError(), loc=("body", field.alias)))
                else:
                    values[field.name] = deepcopy(field.default)
                    continue

            if field.shape is list:
                values[field.name] = value
            elif field.shape is set:
                values[field.name] = set(value)
            elif field.shape is tuple:
                values[field.name] = tuple(value)

            v_, errors_ = field.validate(values[field.name], values, loc=("body", field.alias))
            if isinstance(errors_, ErrorWrapper):
                errors.append(errors_)
            elif isinstance(errors_, list):
                errors.extend(errors_)
    return values, errors
```

With this corrected version, the function will correctly handle repeated keys in form data and process values into lists, sets, or tuples based on the field's specified shape. This approach aligns with the GitHub issue's request for supporting repeated key=value pairs in form data.
