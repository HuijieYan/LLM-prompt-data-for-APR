Based on the analysis of the buggy function and the failing tests, it is clear that the function `request_body_to_args` is unable to handle repeated keys in form data correctly. This leads to validation errors and incorrect values being extracted from the form data. The root cause of the bug lies in how the function processes the form data and assigns values to the fields.

To fix the bug and address the GitHub issue related to supporting repeated key=value pairs in form data, we need to modify the function to correctly handle this scenario. Specifically, when multiple values are associated with the same key in the form data, we should collect them into a list before performing validation.

Below is the corrected version of the `request_body_to_args` function:

```python
async def request_body_to_args(
    required_params: List[ModelField],
    received_body: Optional[Union[Dict[str, Any], FormData]],
) -> Tuple[Dict[str, Any], List[ErrorWrapper]]:
    values = {}
    errors = []

    if received_body is not None:
        body_data = received_body.copy()
        for field in required_params:
            field_info = get_field_info(field)
            value: Any = None
            values_list = []

            if field.alias in body_data:
                if field.shape in sequence_shapes and isinstance(received_body, FormData):
                    values_list = body_data.getlist(field.alias)
                else:
                    values_list.append(body_data.pop(field.alias))

                if isinstance(field_info, params.File) and lenient_issubclass(field.type_, bytes):
                    values_list = [await value.read() for value in values_list]

                v_, errors_ = field.validate(values_list, values, loc=("body", field.alias))

                if isinstance(errors_, ErrorWrapper):
                    errors.append(errors_)
                elif isinstance(errors_, list):
                    errors.extend(errors_)
                else:
                    values[field.name] = v_

    return values, errors
```

In this corrected version:
1. We make a copy of the received form data to prevent modifying the original data.
2. Iterate over the required parameters and check if the parameter's alias is present in the form data.
3. If the alias is found, collect all values associated with that alias into a list.
4. Validate the list of values against the field and handle errors accordingly.
5. Assign the validated values to the `values` dictionary.

By implementing this revised logic, the function can correctly handle repeated keys in form data and ensure that validation and value extraction are performed accurately.

Please test this corrected version with the failing tests to ensure that the issue is resolved and the function now behaves as expected.
