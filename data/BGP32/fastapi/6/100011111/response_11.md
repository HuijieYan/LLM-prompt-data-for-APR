### Bug Explanation:
The buggy function `request_body_to_args` is not handling form data with repeated keys correctly, causing validation issues and leading to status code 422 (Unprocessable Entity) instead of the expected 200 response. The function currently does not aggregate repeated keys' values in the form data when processing them, resulting in validation errors.

The issue reported in the GitHub problem description is consistent with the bug observed during test cases where form data with repeated keys is not being handled effectively, causing the validation to fail.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix this bug, the function `request_body_to_args` needs to be modified to correctly handle form data with repeated keys. Instead of processing only the last value for a repeated key, the function should aggregate all values associated with the repeated key into a list. This adjustment will ensure that the function processes form data accurately and enables proper validation without omitting any repeated key values.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
async def request_body_to_args(
    required_params: List[ModelField],
    received_body: Optional[Union[Dict[str, Any], FormData]],
) -> Tuple[Dict[str, Any], List[ErrorWrapper]]:
    values = {}
    errors = []
    for field in required_params:
        value = None
        if received_body is not None:
            if field.shape in sequence_shapes and isinstance(received_body, FormData):
                if field.shape == 0:
                    value = [received_body.get(field.alias)]  # Initialize the value to a list
                else:
                    value = received_body.getlist(field.alias)  # Get a list of all values for the key
            else:
                value = received_body.get(field.alias)
        if value is None:
            if field.required:
                if PYDANTIC_1:
                    errors.append(ErrorWrapper(MissingError(), loc=("body", field.alias)))
                else:  # pragma: nocover
                    errors.append(
                        ErrorWrapper(MissingError(), loc=("body", field.alias), config=BaseConfig)
                    )
            else:
                values[field.name] = deepcopy(field.default)
        else:
            # If the value is a list (due to repeated keys), retain it as is; else, store it as a single value
            if isinstance(value, list):
                v_ = value
            else:
                v_ = value
            v_, errors_ = field.validate(v_, values, loc=("body", field.alias))
            if isinstance(errors_, ErrorWrapper):
                errors.append(errors_)
            elif isinstance(errors_, list):
                errors.extend(errors_)
            else:
                values[field.name] = v_
    
    return values, errors
```

In the corrected version, the function now correctly processes form data with repeated keys by aggregating all associated values into a list and performing validations accordingly. This updated approach addresses the validation issue and ensures that the function handles form data accurately, resolving the problem reported in the GitHub issue.
