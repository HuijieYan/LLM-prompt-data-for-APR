### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `request_body_to_args` is responsible for converting request body data into arguments for request handling.
2. The error messages indicate that the expected status code is 200 but the function is returning a 422 status code.
3. In each failing test case, the function is unable to properly handle non-typing sequences when passed as form data.
4. The function attempts to process the received body data but fails to correctly convert it to the expected values due to a lack of support for non-typing sequences.

### Bug Cause:
The bug occurs because the function doesn't handle non-typing sequences (e.g., list, set, tuple) correctly when they are passed as form data. This leads to validation errors and prevents the successful conversion of the data.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Check the handling of non-typing sequences in the function and ensure that the received data is properly converted for use.
2. Update the logic to account for non-typing sequences and process them accordingly based on the type of sequence being received.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
async def request_body_to_args(
    required_params: List[ModelField],
    received_body: Optional[Union[Dict[str, Any], FormData]],
) -> Tuple[Dict[str, Any], List[ErrorWrapper]]:
    values = {}
    errors = []
    for field in required_params:
        value: Any = None
        if received_body is not None:
            if field.shape in sequence_shapes and isinstance(
                received_body, FormData
            ):
                if field.alias in received_body:
                    value = received_body.getlist(field.alias)
                else:
                    value = field.default
            else:
                value = received_body.get(field.alias)

        if value is None:
            if field.required:
                errors.append(ErrorWrapper(MissingError(), loc=("body", field.alias)))
            else:
                values[field.name] = deepcopy(field.default)
            continue

        if isinstance(field_info, params.File) and lenient_issubclass(field.type_, bytes):
            if isinstance(value, UploadFile):
                value = await value.read()
            elif isinstance(value, sequence_types):
                awaitables = [sub_value.read() for sub_value in value]
                contents = await asyncio.gather(*awaitables)
                value = sequence_shape_to_type[field.shape](contents)

        v_, errors_ = field.validate(value, values, loc=("body", field.alias))
        if isinstance(errors_, ErrorWrapper):
            errors.append(errors_)
        elif isinstance(errors_, list):
            errors.extend(errors_)
        else:
            values[field.name] = v_

    return values, errors
```

By updating the logic in the function to correctly handle non-typing sequences in form data, the corrected version addresses the bug and ensures that the function processes the data accurately for successful validation and conversion.
