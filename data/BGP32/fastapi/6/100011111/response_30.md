### Bug Analysis:
The bug arises due to the way the function `request_body_to_args` handles repeated keys in form data. When multiple values for the same key are present in the `FormData`, the function currently only considers the last value for validation, leading to incorrect results. This issue directly relates to the GitHub issue mentioned, where support for repeated key-value pairs in form data is required.

### Bug Identification:
- The function fails to properly handle multiple values for the same key in form data, causing validation errors.
- The function does not gather all values for a repeated key and treat them as a list during validation.

### Bug Explanation:
The function `request_body_to_args` is designed to process request parameters and convert them to arguments for validation. However, it fails to handle cases where the same key has multiple values in the form data. This results in only the last value being considered for validation, leading to validation errors.

In the failing tests provided, the expected output should contain the repeated values for the same key as a list to satisfy the validation. However, the current implementation fails to aggregate all values for repeated keys, causing the tests to fail with validation errors.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To address the bug and resolve the failing tests, the function should be updated to aggregate all values of repeated keys in form data and treat them as a list for validation. This fix aligns with the GitHub issue requesting support for repeated key-value pairs in form data.

### Corrected Function:
```python
async def request_body_to_args(
    required_params: List[ModelField],
    received_body: Optional[Union[Dict[str, Any], FormData]],
) -> Tuple[Dict[str, Any], List[ErrorWrapper]]:
    values = {}
    errors = []
    if required_params:
        for field in required_params:
            values[field.name] = None
            if received_body is not None:
                key = field.alias
                values[field.name] = received_body.getlist(key) if isinstance(received_body, FormData) else received_body.get(key)
            v_, errors_ = field.validate(values[field.name], values, loc=("body", field.alias))
            if isinstance(errors_, ErrorWrapper):
                errors.append(errors_)
            elif isinstance(errors_, list):
                errors.extend(errors_)
            else:
                values[field.name] = v_
    return values, errors
```

### Bug Fix Summary:
The corrected function now correctly processes repeated keys in form data and aggregates their values as a list for validation. By doing so, the function aligns with the expected behavior and resolves the failing tests related to the handling of multiple values for the same key. This fix also addresses the GitHub issue requesting support for repeated key-value pairs in form data.
