### Bug Fix Analysis:
1. The function `request_body_to_args` is failing to correctly handle cases where the received body has multiple values for the same key in the form data.
2. The bug stems from how the function processes the received body when multiple values are present for a single key. It currently overrides the previous value with the latest value, causing only the last key=value pair to be considered.
3. The error message indicates that the expected status code of 200 is not matched, leading to a 422 error, which indicates validation errors.
4. To fix the bug, the function needs to account for scenarios where multiple values exist for a single key and handle them appropriately to include all values.
5. By modifying the logic inside the function to properly handle multiple values for the same key, the bug can be fixed.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Modify the function to collect all values for a key in a list instead of overwriting them. This will ensure that all values are considered during validation.
2. Update the logic to handle multiple values for the same key in the received body, ensuring that all values are processed correctly.
3. Implement a mechanism to extract and combine all values for a key into a single list to accurately represent the input data.
4. Ensure that the function correctly handles scenarios where multiple values are present for a key to prevent data loss and validation errors.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
async def request_body_to_args(
    required_params: List[ModelField],
    received_body: Optional[Union[Dict[str, Any], FormData]],
) -> Tuple[Dict[str, Any], List[ErrorWrapper]]:
    values = {}
    errors = []
    
    if required_params:
        for field in required_params:
            if received_body is not None:
                if field.shape in sequence_shapes and isinstance(received_body, FormData):
                    values[field.name] = received_body.getlist(field.alias)
                else:
                    values[field.name] = received_body.get(field.alias)
            
            if values[field.name] is None or (isinstance(get_field_info(field), params.Form) and values[field.name] == ""):
                if field.required:
                    errors.append(ErrorWrapper(MissingError(), loc=("body", field.alias)))
                else:
                    values[field.name] = deepcopy(field.default)
    
    return values, errors
```

This corrected version of the function should address the bug by correctly processing all values for a key in the received form data. It ensures that multiple values for the same key are captured and included in the output dictionary for validation.
