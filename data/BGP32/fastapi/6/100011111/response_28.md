### Bug Analysis
The buggy function `request_body_to_args` is designed to parse and validate body parameters based on the required parameters and the received body. The function seems to have an issue with handling sequences like lists, sets, and tuples when they are present as form data. The function currently processes the form data incorrectly, leading to validation errors and mismatches in return values.

1. The function does not handle sequences correctly when they are sent as form data, resulting in validation errors and incorrect values.
2. Incorrect parsing of form data and handling of sequences leads to the function not meeting the expected behavior for form data with repeated keys/values.

### Bug Explanation
The bug occurs due to the incorrect handling of sequences (like lists, sets, tuples) when they are received as form data. The function fails to parse these sequences properly, leading to validation errors and mismatched return values based on the expected behavior.

For example, in all the provided failing test cases, the function fails to correctly process form data with sequences like lists, sets, and tuples. This results in validation errors and incorrect values being assigned to the `values` dictionary.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix this bug, we need to update the function `request_body_to_args` to correctly handle form data containing sequences (lists, sets, tuples). This involves properly parsing and validating these sequences to align with the expected behavior.

1. Identify the sections of the function responsible for processing sequences in form data.
2. Update the parsing logic for sequences to correctly retrieve and validate the values.
3. Ensure that the function assigns the correct values to the `values` dictionary and handles error cases appropriately.

### Corrected Version of the Function
Here is the corrected version of the `request_body_to_args` function that addresses the bug:

```python
async def request_body_to_args(
    required_params: List[ModelField],
    received_body: Optional[Union[Dict[str, Any], FormData]],
) -> Tuple[Dict[str, Any], List[ErrorWrapper]]:
    values = {}
    errors = []

    if isinstance(received_body, FormData):
        for field in required_params:
            value = received_body.getlist(field.alias)
            v_, errors_ = field.validate(value, values, loc=("body", field.alias))
            if isinstance(errors_, ErrorWrapper):
                errors.append(errors_)
            elif isinstance(errors_, list):
                errors.extend(errors_)
            else:
                values[field.name] = v_

    return values, errors
```

In this corrected version, the function specifically handles the case when the `received_body` is of type `FormData`. It retrieves values using `getlist` to account for sequences, validates these values, and populates the `values` dictionary accordingly to ensure correct parsing and validation of form data with sequences.

By using this corrected version, the function should now properly handle form data containing sequences like lists, sets, and tuples, resolving the validation errors and mismatches in return values observed in the failing tests.
