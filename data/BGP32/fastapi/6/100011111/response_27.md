### Bug Analysis:
The buggy function `request_body_to_args` fails to handle repeated key-values correctly when receiving `FormData` objects, resulting in only the last key-value pair being considered during validation. This behavior conflicts with the expected behavior where the list of values should be preserved and validated against as a whole.

### Bug Location:
The bug is likely occurring when processing repeated key-values in `FormData`. The code logic currently only considers the last value for a key, leading to incorrect validation results.

### Bug Explanation:
The function iterates over required parameters and retrieves values from the `received_body` based on the key aliases. If the same key is repeated in the `FormData`, only the last value is extracted and processed, leading to validation against a single value instead of the full list.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix this bug, we need to modify the logic within the function to correctly handle repeated key-values in `FormData` inputs. We should aggregate all values for the same key into a list and validate against this list as expected.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
Here is the corrected version of the `request_body_to_args` function:

```python
async def request_body_to_args(
    required_params: List[ModelField],
    received_body: Optional[Union[Dict[str, Any], FormData]],
) -> Tuple[Dict[str, Any], List[ErrorWrapper]]:
    values = {}
    errors = []

    if required_params:
        for field in required_params:
            alias = field.alias
            values_field = received_body.getlist(alias) if received_body and alias in received_body else []
            
            if not values_field:
                if field.required:
                    if PYDANTIC_1:
                        errors.append(
                            ErrorWrapper(MissingError(), loc=("body", alias))
                        )
                    else:  # pragma: nocover
                        errors.append(
                            ErrorWrapper(  # type: ignore
                                MissingError(),
                                loc=("body", alias),
                                config=BaseConfig,
                            )
                        )
                else:
                    values_field = deepcopy(field.default)
            else:
                values_field = [await field.validate(value, values, loc=("body", alias))[0] for value in values_field]

            values[field.name] = values_field

    return values, errors
```

### Explanation of Correction:
The corrected version now correctly collects all values associated with the same key into a list for validation. The function iterates over each required parameter, retrieves all associated values for the parameter's alias, validates them, and stores them as a list in the `values` dictionary. This approach ensures that all key-values are processed and validated as expected.

By implementing this correction, the function now aligns with the expected behavior and addresses the issue reported on the GitHub platform regarding the proper handling of repeated key-values in form data processing.
