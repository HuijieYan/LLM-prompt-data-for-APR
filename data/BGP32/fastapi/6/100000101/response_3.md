The bug in the provided function lies in the logic that handles sequence types like lists, sets, and tuples. The function fails to correctly extract values from the received `FormData` and convert them into the expected sequence type based on the field's definition. Additionally, the function doesn't handle the case where the field's type is a sequence but the received value is not a list.

To fix the bug, we need to update the logic for handling sequence types and ensure that the values are converted to the appropriate sequence type before validation.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
async def request_body_to_args(
    required_params: List[ModelField],
    received_body: Optional[Union[Dict[str, Any], FormData]],
) -> Tuple[Dict[str, Any], List[ErrorWrapper]]:
    values = {}
    errors = []
    
    sequence_shapes = {1, 2, 5}  # Define the shapes for different sequence types
    sequence_shape_to_type = {1: list, 2: set, 5: tuple}  # Map shape to sequence type
    
    for field in required_params:
        value: Any = None
        
        if received_body is not None:
            if field.shape in sequence_shapes and isinstance(received_body, FormData):
                # Convert values to correct sequence type based on field shape
                if field.shape in sequence_shape_to_type:
                    value = sequence_shape_to_type[field.shape](
                        received_body.getlist(field.alias)
                    )
            else:
                value = received_body.get(field.alias)
                
        if value is None or (isinstance(get_field_info(field), params.Form) and value == ""):
            if field.required:
                errors.append(ErrorWrapper(MissingError(), loc=("body", field.alias)))
            else:
                values[field.name] = deepcopy(field.default)
        else:
            v_, errors_ = field.validate(value, values, loc=("body", field.alias))
            if isinstance(errors_, ErrorWrapper):
                errors.append(errors_)
            elif isinstance(errors_, list):
                errors.extend(errors_)
            else:
                values[field.name] = v_
    
    return values, errors
```

This corrected version ensures that the values extracted from `FormData` are converted to the correct sequence type specified by the field's shape. It also handles the case where the field's shape is not a sequence type.

Please test this corrected version with the provided expected cases to ensure it works as expected.
