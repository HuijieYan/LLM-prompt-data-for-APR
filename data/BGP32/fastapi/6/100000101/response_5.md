The buggy function `request_body_to_args` is designed to transform received form data into arguments based on the required parameters specified. However, there are several issues in the function that prevent it from working correctly:

1. The function expects `received_body` to be either a dictionary or `FormData`. If it's a dictionary, it directly assigns the field's alias as a key and the `received_body` as the value, assuming there is only one required field. This logic does not account for multiple fields with the same name.

2. The assignment of `value` based on the shape of the field and `received_body` is incorrect in some cases, leading to incorrect values being extracted.

3. There are issues with the validation and handling of form data fields, especially when dealing with files or sequence shapes.

To fix these issues and align the function with the expected input/output values, we need to make sure the function correctly handles multiple required params and extracts values from the `received_body` properly based on the field's shape and type.

Here is the corrected version of the `request_body_to_args` function:

```python
async def request_body_to_args(
    required_params: List[ModelField],
    received_body: Optional[Union[Dict[str, Any], FormData]],
) -> Tuple[Dict[str, Any], List[ErrorWrapper]]:
    values = {}
    errors = []
    
    for field in required_params:
        if isinstance(received_body, FormData):
            if field.alias in received_body.keys():
                value = received_body[field.alias]
                
                if isinstance(value, list):
                    if field.shape == 1:
                        value = value[0] if len(value) == 1 else value
                    else:
                        value = tuple(value)
                
                if isinstance(value, UploadFile):
                    value = await value.read()
                
                v_, errors_ = field.validate(value, values, loc=("body", field.alias))
                if isinstance(errors_, ErrorWrapper):
                    errors.append(errors_)
                elif isinstance(errors_, list):
                    errors.extend(errors_)
                else:
                    values[field.name] = v_
            else:
                if field.required:
                    errors.append(
                        ErrorWrapper(MissingError(), loc=("body", field.alias))
                    )
                else:
                    values[field.name] = deepcopy(field.default)
    
    return values, errors
``` 

In this corrected version:
- It iterates over all required parameters correctly.
- It checks if the field's alias exists in the `received_body`.
- It handles cases where the `received_body` contains a list of values corresponding to a single field.
- It correctly handles file uploads and other sequence shapes.
- It validates the extracted values and builds the `values` dictionary accordingly.

This corrected version should align with the expected input/output values provided in the three test cases.
