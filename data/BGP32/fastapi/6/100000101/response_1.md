The buggy function `request_body_to_args` has several issues that need to be addressed:
1. The handling of `received_body` for different shapes and types is inconsistent and can lead to incorrect results.
2. The logic for converting values to the desired types (like lists, sets, tuples) is unclear and can cause unexpected behavior.
3. Errors are not being handled properly, especially when a field is required but missing from the input body.

To fix the bug, we need to:
1. Ensure that the conversion of `received_body` values aligns with the field's shape and type.
2. Correctly handle error cases where required fields are missing in the input body.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
async def request_body_to_args(
    required_params: List[ModelField],
    received_body: Optional[Union[Dict[str, Any], FormData]],
) -> Tuple[Dict[str, Any], List[ErrorWrapper]]:
    values = {}
    errors = []
    for field in required_params:
        field_info = get_field_info(field)
        embed = getattr(field_info, "embed", None)
        if len(required_params) == 1 and not embed:
            received_body = {field.alias: received_body}
        
        value: Any = None
        if received_body is not None:
            if field.shape in sequence_shapes and isinstance(received_body, FormData):
                value = received_body.getlist(field.alias)
            else:
                value = received_body.get(field.alias)
        
        if value is None or (isinstance(field_info, params.Form) and value == "") or (
            isinstance(field_info, params.Form) and field.shape in sequence_shapes and len(value) == 0
        ):
            if field.required:
                errors.append(ErrorWrapper(MissingError(), loc=("body", field.alias)))
            else:
                values[field.name] = deepcopy(field.default)
            continue
        
        if field.required or value is not None:
            if isinstance(field_info, params.File) and lenient_issubclass(field.type_, bytes) and isinstance(value, UploadFile):
                value = await value.read()
            elif field.shape in sequence_shapes and isinstance(field_info, params.File) and lenient_issubclass(field.type_, bytes) and isinstance(value, sequence_types):
                awaitables = [sub_value.read() for sub_value in value]
                contents = await asyncio.gather(*awaitables)
                value = sequence_shape_to_type[field.shape](contents)
                
            v_, errors_ = field.validate(value, values, loc=("body", field.alias))
            if isinstance(errors_, ErrorWrapper):
                errors.append(errors_)
            elif isinstance(errors_, list):
                errors.extend(errors_)
            else:
                values[field.name] = v_
    
    return values, errors
```

This corrected version aims to handle the various input types and shapes appropriately, convert values to the desired types, and accurately handle errors in case of missing required fields.

Please ensure to validate the corrected function by running test cases to verify that it now aligns with the expected input/output values provided.
