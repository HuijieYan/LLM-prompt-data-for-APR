### Bug Analysis:
The buggy function, `request_body_to_args`, is designed to extract values from the received data (`received_body`) based on the required parameters (`required_params`). The function checks for various conditions to handle different types of parameters, like File parameters or sequence shapes.

The failing tests indicate that the function fails to correctly interpret repeated keys (like `items` in the failing tests) in the form data. It only captures the last value of a repeated key, causing incorrect validation leading to status code 422 (unprocessable entity).

The runtime input/output values show that the bug stems from how the function processes form data with repeated keys. It doesn't handle them as a list when mapping to the values dict, leading to validation errors.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, the function needs to handle repeated keys in form data and correctly map them as a list in the `values` dictionary for validation. This adjustment should ensure that the function recognizes all values associated with a repeated key.

### Corrected Function:
```python
async def request_body_to_args(
    required_params: List[ModelField],
    received_body: Optional[Union[Dict[str, Any], FormData]],
) -> Tuple[Dict[str, Any], List[ErrorWrapper]]:
    values = {}
    errors = []

    if not isinstance(received_body, FormData):
        received_data = received_body
    else:
        received_data = {field.alias: value for field in required_params for value in received_body.getlist(field.alias)}

    for field in required_params:
        value = received_data.get(field.alias)
        
        if value is None:
            if field.required:
                errors.append(ErrorWrapper(MissingError(), loc=("body", field.alias)))
            else:
                values[field.alias] = deepcopy(field.default)
            continue
        
        if isinstance(field_info, params.File) and lenient_issubclass(field.type_, bytes) and isinstance(value, UploadFile):
            value = await value.read()
        else:
            v_, errors_ = field.validate(value, values, loc=("body", field.alias))
            if isinstance(errors_, ErrorWrapper):
                errors.append(errors_)
            elif isinstance(errors_, list):
                errors.extend(errors_)
            else:
                values[field.alias] = v_

    return values, errors
```

### Summary:
The corrected function addresses the bug by correctly handling values associated with repeated keys in form data. By iterating through received data and mapping all values to the associated keys as lists, the function can effectively extract and validate the data for the required parameters. This fix should enable the function to pass the failing tests and resolve the issue raised on GitHub regarding support for repeated key=value pairs in form data.
