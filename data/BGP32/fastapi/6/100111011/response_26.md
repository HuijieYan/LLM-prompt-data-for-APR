### Analysis:
The buggy function `request_body_to_args` is responsible for converting the received body data into arguments based on the required parameters. It fails to process repeated keys with different values correctly, leading to validation errors. The failing tests show 422 errors instead of the expected 200 status code. 

The error occurs when handling parameters that are sequences (such as list, set, and tuple) in the received body. In each case, the function fails to correctly process the value and does not handle repeated keys as expected. 

The GitHub issue also highlights a similar problem where repeated keys should be collected into a list before validation to address this limitation.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is primarily caused by how the function processes sequence-shaped fields in the received body. The function incorrectly handles repeated keys for sequences, resulting in validation errors and incorrect values.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, the function needs to properly handle repeated keys for sequence-shaped fields in the received body. It should collect all values for repeated keys into a list before validation. Additionally, the code should be adjusted to correctly handle the different shapes of fields in the input data.

### Corrected Function:
Here is the corrected version of the `request_body_to_args` function:

```python
async def request_body_to_args(
    required_params: List[ModelField],
    received_body: Optional[Union[Dict[str, Any], FormData]],
) -> Tuple[Dict[str, Any], List[ErrorWrapper]]:
    values = {}
    errors = []
    for field in required_params:
        value = None
        if received_body is not None:
            if field.alias in received_body:
                value = received_body.getlist(field.alias) if isinstance(received_body, FormData) else [received_body[field.alias]]
        
        if value is None or (isinstance(field_info, params.Form) and not value):
            if field.required:
                errors.append(ErrorWrapper(MissingError(), loc=("body", field.alias)))
            else:
                default_value = deepcopy(field.default)
                values[field.alias] = default_value
            
        else:
            if isinstance(field_info, params.File) and lenient_issubclass(field.type_, bytes):
                value = await value[0].read() if isinstance(value[0], UploadFile) else value[0]
                
            v_, errors_ = field.validate(value, values, loc=("body", field.alias))           
            if isinstance(errors_, ErrorWrapper):
                errors.append(errors_)
            elif isinstance(errors_, list):
                errors.extend(errors_)
            else:
                values[field.alias] = v_
    
    return values, errors
```

This corrected version of the function properly handles repeated keys in sequence-shaped fields and collects the values into a list before validation. It addresses the bug related to processing sequence parameters in the received body data.
