### Bug Analysis
1. The `request_body_to_args` function is designed to convert a request body or form data into corresponding arguments based on required parameters.
2. The function processes each required parameter one by one, extracting values from the received body using the parameter alias.
3. Errors are generated for missing or invalid values, and the final set of valid values is returned along with the error list.
4. The function has issues handling sequence parameters like lists, sets, and tuples, resulting in failing tests and status code mismatches.
5. The GitHub issue highlights the need to support repeated key=value in form data, which is not currently addressed by the function.

### Bug Identification
- The core issue lies in how the function handles sequence-shaped fields and the extraction of values from the received body.

### Bug Explanation
1. For Case 1, with a required list parameter and FormData containing multiple values for the same key, only the last value is processed leading to incorrect validation and error formation.
2. Similarly, for Cases 2 and 3 with set and tuple parameters, the last value processed affects the validation, causing the failing tests.

### Bug Fix Strategy
1. Update the function to properly handle sequence-shaped fields when multiple values exist for the same key in the received body.
2. Enhance the value extraction logic to consider all values of a key in FormData for sequence-shaped fields.
3. Modify the validation process to account for multiple values and ensure all values are included in the final result.

### Corrected Function

```python
async def request_body_to_args(
    required_params: List[ModelField],
    received_body: Optional[Union[Dict[str, Any], FormData]],
) -> Tuple[Dict[str, Any], List[ErrorWrapper]]:
    values = {}
    errors = []
    for field in required_params:
        value: Any = None
        if received_body is not None:
            if field.shape in sequence_shapes and isinstance(received_body, FormData):
                if field.alias in received_body:
                    if field.shape == 1:
                        value = [received_body[field.alias]]
                    elif field.shape == 2:
                        value = {field.alias: received_body.getlist(field.alias)}
            else:
                value = received_body.get(field.alias)
        if value is None or (isinstance(field_info, params.Form) and value == ""):
            if field.required:
                errors.append(ErrorWrapper(MissingError(), loc=("body", field.alias))
            else:
                values[field.name] = deepcopy(field.default)
        else:
            if field.shape in sequence_shapes and isinstance(value, list):
                values[field.name] = value
            else:
                if isinstance(field_info, params.File) and lenient_issubclass(field.type_, bytes) and isinstance(value, UploadFile):
                    value = await value.read()
                
                v_, errors_ = field.validate(value, values, loc=("body", field.alias))
                if isinstance(errors_, ErrorWrapper):
                    errors.append(errors_)
                elif isinstance(errors_, list):
                    errors.extend(errors_)
                else:
                    values[field.name] = v_
    return values, errors
```

### Changes Made
1. Restructured the logic for handling sequence-shaped fields in the received body, ensuring all values are correctly processed.
2. Modified the extraction mechanism to account for both single and multiple values associated with a parameter key in FormData.
3. Included specific handling for sequence-shaped fields to properly capture and validate multiple values.
4. Addressed the missing value or empty value scenarios to handle required fields appropriately.
5. Considered file uploads and byte comparisons to correctly process file inputs.

By implementing these changes, the corrected function should properly handle the scenarios outlined in the failing tests and align with the requirements mentioned in the GitHub issue.
