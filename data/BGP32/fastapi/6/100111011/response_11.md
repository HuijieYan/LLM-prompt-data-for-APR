### Analysis and Bug Cause:
1. The `request_body_to_args` function is responsible for extracting data from a request body and validating it against required parameters. However, the bug causes issues when handling sequences like lists, sets, and tuples when passed in form data.
2. The bug arises from incorrectly processing sequence-shaped fields in form data. It fails to handle repeated keys for sequences, leading to validation errors.
3. In the failing tests, the bug causes the status code to differ from the expected status code (422 instead of 200) due to incorrect handling of sequence-shaped fields in the form data.
4. To fix the bug, we need to modify how the function processes sequence-shaped fields within form data and correctly extract these values for validation.
5. The bug also aligns with the GitHub issue requesting support for repeated key=value pairs in form data and processing them as lists for validation.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Update the function to handle repeated keys in form data for sequences like lists, sets, and tuples.
2. Modify the logic to correctly extract and validate sequence-shaped fields from form data.
3. Ensure that if the key appears multiple times, the values are collected as a list (or set for sets).
4. Implement the changes while retaining compatibility with single values for non-sequence-shaped fields.
5. Test the fixed function with the failing tests to confirm the resolution of the issue.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
async def request_body_to_args(
    required_params: List[ModelField],
    received_body: Optional[Union[Dict[str, Any], FormData]],
) -> Tuple[Dict[str, Any], List[ErrorWrapper]]:
    values = {}
    errors = []
    
    for field in required_params:
        value: Any = None
        if received_body is not None:
            if field.shape in sequence_shapes and isinstance(
                received_body, FormData
            ):
                if field.alias in received_body:
                    value = received_body.getlist(field.alias)
                else:
                    value = []
            else:
                value = received_body.get(field.alias)
        
        if (
            value is None
            or (isinstance(field_info, params.Form) and value == "")
            or (
                isinstance(field_info, params.Form)
                and field.shape in sequence_shapes
                and len(value) == 0
            )
        ):
            if field.required:
                if PYDANTIC_1:
                    errors.append(
                        ErrorWrapper(MissingError(), loc=("body", field.alias))
                    )
                else:
                    errors.append(
                        ErrorWrapper(
                            MissingError(),
                            loc=("body", field.alias),
                            config=BaseConfig,
                        )
                    )
            else:
                values[field.name] = deepcopy(field.default)
            continue
        
        if (
            isinstance(field_info, params.File)
            and lenient_issubclass(field.type_, bytes)
            and isinstance(value, UploadFile)
        ):
            value = await value.read()
        elif (
            field.shape in sequence_shapes
            and isinstance(field_info, params.File)
            and lenient_issubclass(field.type_, bytes)
            and isinstance(value, sequence_types)
        ):
            if field.shape == 1:
                value = [await v.read() for v in value]
            else:
                awaitables = [v.read() for v in value]
                contents = await asyncio.gather(*awaitables)
                value = sequence_shape_to_type[field.shape](contents)
        
        v_, errors_ = field.validate(value, values, loc=("body", field.alias))
        if isinstance(errors_, ErrorWrapper):
            errors.append(errors_)
        elif isinstance(errors_, list):
            errors.extend(errors_)
        else:
            values[field.name] = v_
    
    return values, errors
```

Applying these corrections to the `request_body_to_args` function should address the issue of handling sequences like lists, sets, and tuples properly for form data processing in FastAPI. This revised function should now correctly process repeated keys for these sequences and ensure validation behaves as expected, resolving the failing tests and aligning with the GitHub issue's request for improved form data handling.
