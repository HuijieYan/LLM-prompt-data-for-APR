### Bug Analysis
1. The bug in the `request_body_to_args` function stems from the incorrect handling of sequences in form data, leading to validation errors and incorrect processing of data.
2. The bug is related to missing functionality in handling repeated keys in form data for lists, sets, and tuples.
3. The failing tests highlight the issue by showing validation errors and incorrect status codes due to failed validations.
4. To fix the bug, we need to update the function to extract repeated keys correctly and handle the sequences appropriately.

### Bug Fix Strategy
1. Modify the function to properly handle repeated keys in form data for lists, sets, and tuples.
2. Extract values based on the sequence shape and handle validation errors consistently for all cases.
3. Ensure that the function correctly processes the form data and returns the expected values without validation errors.

### Corrected Version of the Function
```python
async def request_body_to_args(
    required_params: List[ModelField],
    received_body: Optional[Union[Dict[str, Any], FormData]],
) -> Tuple[Dict[str, Any], List[ErrorWrapper]]:
    values = {}
    errors = []
    for field in required_params:
        value = None
        if received_body is not None:
            if field.shape in sequence_shapes and isinstance(received_body, FormData):
                if field.alias in received_body:
                    value = received_body.getlist(field.alias)
            else:
                value = received_body.get(field.alias)

        if value is None or (field.required and value == ""):
            errors.append(ErrorWrapper(MissingError(), loc=("body", field.alias))
        else:
            v, errors_ = field.validate(value, values, loc=("body", field.alias))
            if isinstance(errors_, ErrorWrapper):
                errors.append(errors_)
            elif isinstance(errors_, list):
                errors.extend(errors_)
            else:
                values[field.name] = v

    return values, errors
```

### Code Explanation
1. The corrected version iterates through each field in the required parameters list.
2. It properly extracts values based on the sequence shape for form data.
3. Handles missing values and validation errors consistently for all cases.
4. Validates the extracted values and populates the values dictionary accordingly.

By implementing these corrections, the `request_body_to_args` function should now handle sequences in form data correctly and pass the failing tests.
