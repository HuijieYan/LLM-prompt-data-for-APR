### Bug Diagnosis:
The issue arises from `request_body_to_args` function not handling multiple values for the same key in form data properly. It only picks the last value, causing validation issues. This is due to the logic where `received_body` is overwritten.

#### Potential Bug Locations:
1. The usage of `received_body` being updated within the loop.
2. Handling of multiple values for the same key.

### Cause of the Bug:
- The code overwrites `received_body` in the loop, causing the loss of multiple values. It only retains the last value for each key, leading to validation errors as observed in failing tests. This behavior is not aligned with the expectation of handling repeated keys in form data.
- Because the function does not aggregate multiple values for the same key, the validation process is incorrect and results in failed tests.

### Fixing Strategy:
To fix this bug, we need to update the function to properly aggregate multiple values for the same key in the form data before processing each field's validation. This approach will align the function's behavior with the expectations to handle repeated key=value pairs in the form data.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
To fulfill the fix strategy and address the bug, the following corrected version of the function is provided:

```python
async def request_body_to_args(
    required_params: List[ModelField],
    received_body: Optional[Union[Dict[str, Any], FormData]],
) -> Tuple[Dict[str, Any], List[ErrorWrapper]]:
    values = {}
    errors = []
    if required_params:
        for field in required_params:
            value: List[Any] = []
            if received_body is not None:
                if field.shape in sequence_shapes and isinstance(
                    received_body, FormData
                ):
                    values_list = received_body.getlist(field.alias)
                    value.extend(values_list)
                else:
                    value.append(received_body.get(field.alias))
            if None in value:
                if field.required:
                    errors.append(ErrorWrapper(MissingError(), loc=("body", field.alias)))
                else:
                    values[field.name] = deepcopy(field.default)
                continue
            if (
                isinstance(field_info, params.File)
                and lenient_issubclass(field.type_, bytes)
                and all(isinstance(v, UploadFile) for v in value)
            ):
                value = [await v.read() for v in value]
            v_, errors_ = field.validate(value, values, loc=("body", field.alias))
            if isinstance(errors_, ErrorWrapper):
                errors.append(errors_)
            elif isinstance(errors_, list):
                errors.extend(errors_)
            else:
                values[field.name] = v_
    return values, errors
```

This corrected version ensures that all values for a specific key are aggregated into a list before proceeding with validation. This behavior addresses the bug related to handling repeated key=value pairs in form data.
