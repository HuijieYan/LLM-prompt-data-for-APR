### Analysis:
1. The `request_body_to_args` function is supposed to extract values from the received body according to the required parameters and return the values and errors encountered during validation.
2. The bug seems to be related to incorrect handling of sequence shapes (list, set, tuple) in the received body while processing form data.
3. The failing tests indicate that the response status code is `422` instead of the expected `200`, which means there are validation errors occurring during the processing of the form data.
4. The GitHub issue highlights the handling of repeated keys in form data to build a list properly before validation.

### Bug Cause:
The bug occurs because the function does not correctly handle sequence shapes and fails to process repeated keys in form data as lists for validation. This leads to validation errors and incorrect status codes in the response for the failing tests.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Modify the function to correctly handle sequence shapes (list, set, tuple) when processing form data.
2. Implement a mechanism to store repeated keys as lists for proper validation.
3. Update the function to align with the expectations mentioned in the GitHub issue by improving the handling of form data.

### Corrected Function:
```python
async def request_body_to_args(
    required_params: List[ModelField],
    received_body: Optional[Union[Dict[str, Any], FormData]],
) -> Tuple[Dict[str, Any], List[ErrorWrapper]]:
    values = {}
    errors = []
    for field in required_params:
        value: Any = None
        if received_body is not None:
            if field.shape in sequence_shapes and isinstance(received_body, FormData):
                value = received_body.getlist(field.alias)
            else:
                value = received_body.get(field.alias)
        if (
            value is None
            or (isinstance(get_field_info(field), params.Form) and value == "")
            or (
                isinstance(get_field_info(field), params.Form)
                and field.shape in sequence_shapes
                and len(value) == 0
            )
        ):
            if field.required:
                if PYDANTIC_1:
                    errors.append(
                        ErrorWrapper(MissingError(), loc=("body", field.alias))
                    )
                else:
                    errors.append(
                        ErrorWrapper(MissingError(), loc=("body", field.alias), config=BaseConfig)
                    )
            else:
                values[field.name] = deepcopy(field.default)
        else:
            if isinstance(field_info, params.File) and lenient_issubclass(field.type_, bytes):
                if field.shape in sequence_shapes:
                    awaitables = [sub_value.read() for sub_value in value]
                    contents = await asyncio.gather(*awaitables)
                    value = sequence_shape_to_type[field.shape](contents)
                else:
                    value = await value.read()
            v_, errors_ = field.validate(value, values, loc=("body", field.alias))
            if isinstance(errors_, ErrorWrapper):
                errors.append(errors_)
            elif isinstance(errors_, list):
                errors.extend(errors_)
            else:
                values[field.name] = v_
    return values, errors
```

By updating the `request_body_to_args` function with the corrected version, the function should now properly handle sequence shapes in form data and process repeated keys as lists for validation, resolving the bug and passing the failing tests.
