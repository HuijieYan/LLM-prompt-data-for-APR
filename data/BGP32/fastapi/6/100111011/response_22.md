### Analysis
The `request_body_to_args` function is responsible for processing required parameters and received body data, populating values and errors accordingly. The bug seems to stem from the behavior where only the last value of a repeated key in form data is considered, resulting in validation issues for certain types of parameters (like list, set, and tuple).

### Potential Error Locations
The issue might reside in how the function handles processing repeated key=value pairs in FormData and validating them against the required parameters.

### Cause of the Bug
The cause of the bug lies in the way repeated key=value pairs are handled. When iterating through the required_params, only the last value for a repeated key is being assigned and validated. This leads to incorrect values assigned to parameters like list, set, and tuple, causing validation errors.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to modify the logic in the function to correctly process repeated key=value pairs in FormData and assign them as lists for parameters like list, set, and tuple. This fix should ensure that all values associated with a repeated key are considered during validation.

### Corrected Function

Here is the corrected version of the `request_body_to_args` function:

```python
async def request_body_to_args(
    required_params: List[ModelField],
    received_body: Optional[Union[Dict[str, Any], FormData]],
) -> Tuple[Dict[str, Any], List[ErrorWrapper]]:
    values = {}
    errors = []
    if required_params:
        for field in required_params:
            received_values = received_body.getlist(field.alias) if received_body is not None else []
            if not received_values:
                if field.required:
                    errors.append(ErrorWrapper(MissingError(), loc=("body", field.alias)))
                else:
                    values[field.name] = deepcopy(field.default)
            else:
                validated_values = []
                for value in received_values:
                    v_, errors_ = field.validate(value, values, loc=("body", field.alias))
                    if isinstance(errors_, ErrorWrapper):
                        errors.append(errors_)
                    elif isinstance(errors_, list):
                        errors.extend(errors_)
                    else:
                        validated_values.append(v_)
                if validated_values:
                    values[field.name] = validated_values

    return values, errors
```

This corrected version of the function processes repeated key=value pairs correctly, ensuring that all values are considered during validation for parameters like list, set, and tuple. This fix should address the validation issues observed in the failing tests.
