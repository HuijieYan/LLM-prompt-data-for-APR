### Bug Analysis:
1. The `request_body_to_args` function is designed to convert received request body parameters into arguments. It iterates over the required parameters, retrieves values from the `received_body`, performs necessary validations, and constructs the final values and errors lists to return.
   
2. The key issue lies in how the function handles the `received_body` parameter, specifically when dealing with sequence shapes and forms. It encounters a problem when the input data contains repeated keys like `items`. This causes the code to incorrectly extract values, leading to failed validations and error generation.

3. The failing tests highlight the issue where the function fails to handle repeated keys while processing data. The test data for cases like list, set, and tuple are not correctly parsed by the function, resulting in status code 422 (validation error) instead of the expected 200 (success).

4. The bug arises due to the function not properly processing repeated keys in the input `FormData`. This behavior contradicts the expected parsing and validation logic, as identified in both failing test cases and the GitHub issue related to supporting repeated key=value pairs.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. To resolve the issue, the function needs to handle repeated keys in the received body data correctly. It should aggregate all values corresponding to the same key before validation to align with the request data structure, as suggested in the GitHub issue.

2. Update the logic to accumulate all values for a key into a list for sequence shapes when repeated keys are present. This adjustment will ensure that all data is properly processed and validated without inadvertently discarding or processing only the last key-value pair.

### Corrected Function:
```python
async def request_body_to_args(
    required_params: List[ModelField],
    received_body: Optional[Union[Dict[str, Any], FormData]],
) -> Tuple[Dict[str, Any], List[ErrorWrapper]]:

    values = {}
    errors = []

    if required_params:
        for field in required_params:
            if received_body is not None:
                value = received_body.get(field.alias)
                if field.shape in sequence_shapes and isinstance(value, (list, tuple, set)):
                    value = list(value)
                elif field.shape in sequence_shapes:
                    value = [value]
                
                if value is None:
                    if field.required:
                        if PYDANTIC_1:
                            errors.append(ErrorWrapper(MissingError(), loc=("body", field.alias)))
                        else:
                            errors.append(ErrorWrapper(MissingError(), loc=("body", field.alias), config=BaseConfig))
                    else:
                        values[field.name] = deepcopy(field.default)
                else:
                    if isinstance(field_info, params.File) and lenient_issubclass(field.type_, bytes) and isinstance(value, UploadFile):
                        value = await value.read()
                    elif isinstance(field_info, params.File) and lenient_issubclass(field.type_, bytes) and all(isinstance(v, UploadFile) for v in value):
                        awaitables = [v.read() for v in value]
                        value = sequence_shape_to_type[field.shape](await asyncio.gather(*awaitables))
                    
                    v_, errors_ = field.validate(value, values, loc=("body", field.alias))

                    if isinstance(errors_, ErrorWrapper):
                        errors.append(errors_)
                    elif isinstance(errors_, list):
                        errors.extend(errors_)
                    else:
                        values[field.name] = v_

    return values, errors
```

### Proposed Changes:
- Modified the extraction of values for a key to handle sequence shapes correctly.
- Create a list of values for the same key when a sequence shape and repeated keys are encountered.
- Adjust the validation logic to account for the changes in how data is processed and validated.

By incorporating these changes, the corrected function should now handle repeated keys in the form data properly, enabling the function to parse and validate the input without discarding important information and, thus, resolving the bug.
