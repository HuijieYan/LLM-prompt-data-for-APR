### Bug Analysis
The buggy function `request_body_to_args` is responsible for extracting values from a request body based on required parameters. The function tries to handle different scenarios like extracting values from FormData and validating them. The bug seems to occur when handling sequences like lists, sets, and tuples where only the last value is considered. This results in validation errors in the failing tests.

#### Potential Error Locations:
1. Processing of received body data for different field shapes.
2. Handling of form data for upload files.
3. Validation and error handling logic.

### Bug Cause
The bug arises due to the incorrect handling of sequences in the `request_body_to_args` function. When processing the received body data and extracting values, only the last value of a sequence is considered. This leads to validation errors when validating against the last value of the sequence, causing the failing tests.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To address the bug:
1. Improve the processing of sequences to extract all values correctly.
2. Modify the logic for validating sequences to handle multiple values properly.
3. Ensure error handling accounts for sequences to avoid validation errors.

### Corrected Function
Below is the corrected version of the `request_body_to_args` function:
```python
async def request_body_to_args(
    required_params: List[ModelField],
    received_body: Optional[Union[Dict[str, Any], FormData]],
) -> Tuple[Dict[str, Any], List[ErrorWrapper]]:
    values = {}
    errors = []
    
    if required_params:
        for field in required_params:
            value: Any = None
            if received_body is not None:
                if field.shape in sequence_shapes and isinstance(received_body, FormData):
                    if field.alias in received_body:
                        if field.shape == 1:
                            value = received_body.getlist(field.alias)
                        else:
                            value = received_body.get(field.alias)
                else:
                    value = received_body.get(field.alias)
            
            if value is None or (isinstance(field_info, params.Form) and value == "") or (isinstance(field_info, params.Form) and field.shape in sequence_shapes and len(value) == 0):
                if field.required:
                    errors.append(ErrorWrapper(MissingError(), loc=("body", field.alias))
                else:
                    values[field.name] = deepcopy(field.default)
            else:
                if isinstance(field_info, params.File) and lenient_issubclass(field.type_, bytes) and isinstance(value, UploadFile):
                    value = await value.read()
                elif field.shape in sequence_shapes and isinstance(field_info, params.File) and lenient_issubclass(field.type_, bytes) and isinstance(value, sequence_types):
                    awaitables = [sub_value.read() for sub_value in value]
                    contents = await asyncio.gather(*awaitables)
                    value = sequence_shape_to_type[field.shape](contents)
                
                v_, errors_ = field.validate(value, values, loc=("body", field.alias))
                if isinstance(errors_, ErrorWrapper):
                    errors.append(errors_)
                elif isinstance(errors_, list):
                    errors.extend(errors_)
                else:
                    values[field.name] = v_
    
    return values, errors
```

By updating the logic to correctly handle sequences and process all values, the corrected function addresses the bug. This should ensure that the failing tests related to sequences like lists, sets, and tuples pass successfully.
