### Bug Analysis:
1. The `request_body_to_args` function is designed to convert incoming request body data into arguments to be validated. It fails to handle scenarios where form data includes repeated keys. This leads to incorrect validation and errors when dealing with sequences like lists, sets, and tuples.
   
2. The bug is likely located in the logic handling repeated keys within form data and the subsequent value assignment and validation steps.

3. The error occurs due to the function not properly handling repeated keys within form data. As a result, the function tries to process each value individually, leading to failed validations and incorrect behavior.
   
4. To fix the bug, we need to modify the logic for handling repeated keys, ensuring that values associated with repeated keys are collected and processed correctly.

### Bug Fix:
Here is the corrected version of the `request_body_to_args` function:

```python
async def request_body_to_args(
    required_params: List[ModelField],
    received_body: Optional[Union[Dict[str, Any], FormData]],
) -> Tuple[Dict[str, Any], List[ErrorWrapper]]:
    values = {}
    errors = []
    
    if received_body is None:
        return values, errors

    processed_values = {}

    for field in required_params:
        value: Any = None
        if field.shape in sequence_shapes and isinstance(received_body, FormData):
            value = received_body.getlist(field.alias)
        else:
            value = received_body.get(field.alias)

        if value is None or (isinstance(field_info, params.Form) and value == "") or (
            isinstance(field_info, params.Form)
            and field.shape in sequence_shapes
            and len(value) == 0
        ):
            if field.required:
                if PYDANTIC_1:
                    errors.append(ErrorWrapper(MissingError(), loc=("body", field.alias)))
                else:
                    errors.append(
                        ErrorWrapper(  # type: ignore
                            MissingError(), loc=("body", field.alias), config=BaseConfig
                        )
                    )
            else:
                values[field.name] = deepcopy(field.default)
            continue

        if isinstance(field_info, params.File) and lenient_issubclass(field.type_, bytes):
            if isinstance(value, list):
                value = [await v.read() for v in value]
            else:
                value = await value.read()
        elif (
            field.shape in sequence_shapes
            and isinstance(field_info, params.File)
            and lenient_issubclass(field.type_, bytes)
            and isinstance(value, sequence_types)
        ):
            awaitables = [sub_value.read() for sub_value in value]
            contents = await asyncio.gather(*awaitables)
            value = sequence_shape_to_type[field.shape](contents)

        processed_values.setdefault(field.name, []).extend(value)

    for field_name, value in processed_values.items():
        v_, errors_ = field.validate(value, values, loc=("body", field.name))
        if isinstance(errors_, ErrorWrapper):
            errors.append(errors_)
        elif isinstance(errors_, list):
            errors.extend(errors_)
        else:
            values[field_name] = v_

    return values, errors
```

This corrected version addresses the issue by properly collecting and processing multiple values associated with repeated keys within form data. It ensures that validation is performed correctly for sequences like lists, sets, and tuples, enabling the function to handle such scenarios effectively.

Ensure to test the corrected function with the failing test cases to verify that the bug is successfully fixed and the tests pass without any errors.
