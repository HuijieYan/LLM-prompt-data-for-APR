### Error Analysis:
The buggy function `request_body_to_args` is failing to handle scenarios where form data contains repeated keys, such as lists, sets, or tuples. It fails to properly parse the form data and validate each parameter. This leads to incorrect error generation and eventually fails the tests with status code 422 instead of 200.

The primary issue arises from the section where the function attempts to process the received body. The handling of sequences and files is also affected, causing sub-optimal behavior when validating the fields and generating errors.

### Bug Cause:
The bug in the current function stems from the mishandling of repeated keys in form data and the inadequate validation logic for sequence-shaped fields. This leads to errors in processing the received body and causes incorrect or missing values and errors.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Properly handle repeated keys in form data to construct lists, sets, or tuples.
2. Improve the processing of field values based on the shape and type of the field.
3. Correctly validate the received values and generate errors only when required.

### Updated Corrected Function:
```python
async def request_body_to_args(
    required_params: List[ModelField],
    received_body: Optional[Union[Dict[str, Any], FormData]],
) -> Tuple[Dict[str, Any], List[ErrorWrapper]]:
    values = {}
    errors = []
    if required_params:
        for field in required_params:
            value: Any = None
            if received_body is not None:
                if field.shape in sequence_shapes and isinstance(
                    received_body, FormData
                ):
                    if isinstance(received_body.get(field.alias), list):
                        value = received_body.getlist(field.alias)
                    else:
                        value = [received_body.get(field.alias)]
                else:
                    value = received_body.get(field.alias)
                
                if not value and field.required:
                    errors.append(ErrorWrapper(MissingError(), loc=("body", field.alias))
                else:
                    v_, errors_ = field.validate(value, values, loc=("body", field.alias))
                    if isinstance(errors_, ErrorWrapper):
                        errors.append(errors_)
                    elif isinstance(errors_, list):
                        errors.extend(errors_)
                    else:
                        values[field.name] = v_
                    
    return values, errors
```

With this updated version of the `request_body_to_args` function, the primary issues related to processing repeated keys and validating sequence-shaped field values are addressed. This updated function should resolve the errors and pass the failing tests, ensuring the correct validation and handling of form data.
