### Bug Explanation
The buggy function `request_body_to_args` is not handling repeated keys correctly when dealing with form data containing lists, sets, or tuples. The function processes the form data but only retrieves the last value corresponding to a key instead of collecting all values if the same key appears multiple times. This behavior leads to validation errors for requests with repeated keys in the form data.

Initially, the `request_body_to_args` function is designed to extract values from the received data (either dictionary or FormData) based on the required parameters (ModelField objects) provided. If a field's shape indicates it is a sequence type (list, set, tuple), the function should handle extracting multiple values corresponding to the same key if they exist. However, the current implementation only considers the last value associated with a key in FormData, resulting in incomplete processing and validation errors.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug in the `request_body_to_args` function, we need to adjust the logic for handling sequence types in form data. Modify the code to collect all values for repeated keys in the form data instead of only considering the last value. This change will ensure that all values are properly extracted and validated based on the required parameters provided.

### Bug Fix
Here is the corrected version of the `request_body_to_args` function:

```python
async def request_body_to_args(
    required_params: List[ModelField],
    received_body: Optional[Union[Dict[str, Any], FormData]],
) -> Tuple[Dict[str, Any], List[ErrorWrapper]]:
    values = {}
    errors = []

    if received_body is None:
        return values, errors

    for field in required_params:
        field_info = get_field_info(field)

        alias = field.alias

        if isinstance(received_body, FormData):
            raw_values = received_body.getlist(alias)
        else:
            raw_values = [received_body.get(alias)]

        values_list = []

        for raw_value in raw_values:
            if raw_value is None:
                values_list.append(None)
            else:
                v = await field.validate(raw_value, values, loc=("body", alias))
                if isinstance(v, ErrorWrapper):
                    errors.append(v)
                else:
                    values_list.append(v)

        if len(values_list) == 1:
            values[field.name] = values_list[0]
        else:
            values[field.name] = values_list

    return values, errors
```

In this corrected version, we properly handle repeated keys in the form data for sequence types. The function now retrieves all values associated with a key and validates each value accordingly. The extracted values are stored as a list if there are multiple values for a key in the form data.

By making this adjustment, the `request_body_to_args` function should now be able to correctly process and validate form data with repeated keys, resolving the issue and ensuring that the failing tests pass successfully.
