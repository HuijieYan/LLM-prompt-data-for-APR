### Identifying the Bug
The buggy function `request_body_to_args` processes received form data and extracts values for required parameters based on the specified model fields. The bug seems to occur when handling sequences like lists, sets, or tuples. The current implementation does not correctly handle repeated keys in form data when it should be assigning them as lists for further processing.

### Explaining the Bug
1. In the failing test for a Python list parameter as form data, the assertion fails at `response.status_code == 200`.
2. The bug is identified in handling sequences where repeated keys should be collected and treated as lists for validation but are not correctly handled in the function.
3. The error messages indicate a 422 status code while we expect a successful 200 status code, resulting from incorrect processing of repeated keys in form data.
4. The bug is linked to the GitHub issue discussing the need for FastAPI to support repeated key=value pairs in form data.

### Bug Fix Strategy
1. Modify the function to correctly handle repeated keys in form data by collecting them as lists.
2. Update the implementation to loop through each field and properly parse repeated keys.
3. By ensuring that all values are processed correctly and lists are handled as expected, the bug can be fixed.

### Corrected Version of the Function
```python
async def request_body_to_args(
    required_params: List[ModelField],
    received_body: Optional[Union[Dict[str, Any], FormData]],
) -> Tuple[Dict[str, Any], List[ErrorWrapper]]:
    values = {}
    errors = []

    if required_params:
        for field in required_params:
            value = None
            if received_body is not None and field.alias in received_body:
                value = received_body.getlist(field.alias)

                if len(value) == 1:
                    value = value[0]

            if value is None:
                if field.required:
                    errors.append(
                        ErrorWrapper(MissingError(), loc=("body", field.alias))
                    )
                else:
                    values[field.name] = deepcopy(field.default)
            else:
                if (
                    isinstance(field.field_info, params.File)
                    and lenient_issubclass(field.type_, bytes)
                    and isinstance(value, UploadFile)
                ):
                    value = await value.read()

                v_, errors_ = field.validate(value, values, loc=("body", field.alias))

                if isinstance(errors_, ErrorWrapper):
                    errors.append(errors_)
                elif isinstance(errors_, list):
                    errors.extend(errors_)
                else:
                    values[field.name] = v_

    return values, errors
```

### Impact of the Fix
By implementing the corrected version of the function, the bug related to handling sequences and repeated keys in form data should be resolved. This fix should ensure that the function properly handles repeated keys as lists and correctly extracts values for validation based on the specified model fields.
