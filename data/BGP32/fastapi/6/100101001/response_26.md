## Bug Explanation
The buggy function `request_body_to_args` has a logic issue with handling sequence-shaped fields such as lists, sets, and tuples when they are received as form data. The function incorrectly assumes that it needs to retrieve multiple values for sequence-shaped fields, leading to errors in validation.

In the provided runtime values, the function encounters errors due to incorrect handling of sequence-shaped fields in the form data. For lists, sets, and tuples, the function tries to get the entire list of values instead of individual values. This results in errors during validation as the expected value structure does not match the received data structure.

## Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug:
1. Check the shape of the field, and if it is a sequence shape (list, set, tuple), handle the values appropriately.
2. For sequence shapes, extract individual values or convert them to the desired type before validation.
3. Update the logic to handle sequence shapes in form data correctly for proper validation.

## Corrected Version of the Function
```python
async def request_body_to_args(
    required_params: List[ModelField],
    received_body: Optional[Union[Dict[str, Any], FormData]],
) -> Tuple[Dict[str, Any], List[ErrorWrapper]]:
    values = {}
    errors = []
    if required_params:
        for field in required_params:
            value: Any = None
            if received_body is not None:
                if field.shape in sequence_shapes and isinstance(
                    received_body, FormData
                ):
                    value = received_body.getlist(field.alias)
                    if field.shape == 1:
                        value = value[0] if value else None
                    else:
                        value = set(value)
            else:
                value = received_body.get(field.alias) if received_body is not None else None
            if (
                value is None
                or (isinstance(get_field_info(field), params.Form) and value == "")
                or (
                    isinstance(get_field_info(field), params.Form)
                    and field.shape in sequence_shapes
                    and len(value) == 0
                )
            ):
                if field.required:
                    errors.append(
                        ErrorWrapper(MissingError(), loc=("body", field.alias))
                    )
                else:
                    values[field.name] = deepcopy(field.default)
                continue
            if (
                isinstance(get_field_info(field), params.File)
                and lenient_issubclass(field.type_, bytes)
                and isinstance(value, UploadFile)
            ):
                value = await value.read()
            v_, errors_ = field.validate(value, values, loc=("body", field.alias))
            if isinstance(errors_, ErrorWrapper):
                errors.append(errors_)
            elif isinstance(errors_, list):
                errors.extend(errors_)
            else:
                values[field.name] = v_
    return values, errors
```

By updating the logic to correctly handle sequence-shaped fields in form data, the corrected version of the function should now be able to pass the failing tests provided.
