### Bug Analysis:
The buggy function `request_body_to_args` is designed to convert a request body into arguments based on required parameters specified as ModelField objects. The bug arises when dealing with non-typing sequences like lists, sets, and tuples passed as parameters in the request body. The function fails to correctly handle these non-typing sequence types, leading to errors.

### Bug Location:
The bug lies in how the function processes non-typing sequences such as lists, sets, and tuples when extracting values from the request body.

### Bug Cause:
1. For non-typing sequences like lists, sets, and tuples, the function incorrectly handles the extraction of values from the FormData object.
2. Due to this incorrect handling, the function fails to construct the argument values properly, resulting in errors thrown during validation.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to adjust the logic for extracting values from the request body to correctly handle non-typing sequence types like lists, sets, and tuples. We should ensure that the values are extracted and processed correctly based on the type of the field being handled.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
Below is the corrected version of the `request_body_to_args` function:

```python
async def request_body_to_args(
    required_params: List[ModelField],
    received_body: Optional[Union[Dict[str, Any], FormData]],
) -> Tuple[Dict[str, Any], List[ErrorWrapper]]:
    values = {}
    errors = []
    if required_params:
        for field in required_params:
            if received_body is not None:
                value = received_body.get(field.alias)
                
                if value is None:  # Check if the value is not present
                    if field.required:
                        errors.append(ErrorWrapper(MissingError(), loc=("body", field.alias)))
                    else:
                        values[field.name] = deepcopy(field.default)
                    continue
                
                if isinstance(field.type_, List):
                    value = [value]  # Convert the value to a list if the field type is a list
                    
                v_, errors_ = field.validate(value, values, loc=("body", field.alias))
                
                if isinstance(errors_, ErrorWrapper):
                    errors.append(errors_)
                elif isinstance(errors_, list):
                    errors.extend(errors_)
                else:
                    values[field.name] = v_
    return values, errors
```

### Note:
Ensure to update the function in the correct file (`fastapi/dependencies/utils.py`) and test it with the provided failing test cases to verify that the bug has been successfully fixed.
