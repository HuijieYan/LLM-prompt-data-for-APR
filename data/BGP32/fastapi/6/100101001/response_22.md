### Bug Explanation:
The buggy function `request_body_to_args` is designed to extract values from a request body based on required parameters and validate them. However, there are several issues causing the function to fail the tests:
1. The handling of list, set, and tuple shapes is inconsistent and incorrect.
2. The logic for checking the presence of values and handling errors is flawed.
3. The way sequences (list, set, tuple) and form data are processed is causing errors.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, follow these steps:
1. Update the logic for handling different shapes of fields (list, set, tuple).
2. Refine the validation and error handling process.
3. Correctly process sequences and form data.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
async def request_body_to_args(
    required_params: List[ModelField],
    received_body: Optional[Union[Dict[str, Any], FormData]],
) -> Tuple[Dict[str, Any], List[ErrorWrapper]]:
    values = {}
    errors = []
    
    for field in required_params:
        field_info = get_field_info(field)
        field_name = field.alias
        value = None
        
        if received_body is not None:
            if field.shape in sequence_shapes and isinstance(received_body, FormData):
                value = received_body.getlist(field_name)
                
            else:
                value = received_body.get(field_name)
        
        if value is None or value == "":
            if field.required:
                errors.append(ErrorWrapper(MissingError(), loc=("body", field_name)))
            else:
                values[field.name] = deepcopy(field.default)
        
        else:
            if isinstance(field_info, params.File) and lenient_issubclass(field.type_, bytes) and isinstance(value, UploadFile):
                value = await value.read()
                
            v_, errors_ = field.validate(value, values, loc=("body", field_name))
            
            if isinstance(errors_, ErrorWrapper):
                errors.append(errors_)
                
            elif isinstance(errors_, list):
                errors.extend(errors_)
                
            else:
                values[field.name] = v_
                
    return values, errors
```

By making these corrections, the function should now handle different shapes of fields correctly and process sequences and form data accurately. This corrected version should pass the failing tests.
