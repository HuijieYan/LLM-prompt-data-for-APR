The bug in the `request_body_to_args` function lies in how it handles sequences (list, set, tuple) in the received form data, leading to incorrect validation and error generation.

### Error Location:
- The bug arises from the handling of sequence-shaped fields and their validation. The current implementation does not correctly process sequence-shaped fields within form data (e.g., items as a list, set, tuple).

### Cause of the Bug:
- The function incorrectly handles sequence-shaped fields like list, set, tuple within the form data. It does not correctly retrieve and validate the values from these fields, leading to errors in processing and validation.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
- To fix the bug, the function needs to accurately extract and validate sequence-shaped fields from the received form data. Proper handling of these fields will ensure correct validation and error reporting.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
async def request_body_to_args(
    required_params: List[ModelField],
    received_body: Optional[Union[Dict[str, Any], FormData]],
) -> Tuple[Dict[str, Any], List[ErrorWrapper]]:
    values = {}
    errors = []
    for field in required_params:
        value: Any = None
        if received_body is not None:
            if isinstance(received_body, FormData):
                value = received_body.getlist(field.alias) if field.shape == 1 else received_body.get(field.alias)
        if value is None or (isinstance(field_info, params.Form) and value == ""):
            if field.required:
                errors.append(ErrorWrapper(MissingError(), loc=("body", field.alias)))
            else:
                values[field.alias] = deepcopy(field.default)
            continue
        if isinstance(field_info, params.File) and lenient_issubclass(field.type_, bytes):
            if field.shape == 1:
                awaitables = [sub_value.read() for sub_value in value]
                value = sequence_shape_to_type[field.shape](await asyncio.gather(*awaitables))
            else:
                value = await value.read()
        v_, errors_ = field.validate(value, values, loc=("body", field.alias))
        if isinstance(errors_, ErrorWrapper):
            errors.append(errors_)
        elif isinstance(errors_, list):
            errors.extend(errors_)
        else:
            values[field.name] = v_
    return values, errors
```

This corrected version of the function addresses the issue by correctly handling sequence-shaped fields within the form data (list, set, tuple) and ensuring proper validation and error handling based on the field shape.

After applying this fix, the function should now be able to handle sequence-shaped fields correctly and pass the failing tests provided.
