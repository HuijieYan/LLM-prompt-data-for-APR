### Bug Analysis
- The buggy function `request_body_to_args` is designed to convert the request body parameters into usable arguments based on the required parameters and the received body data.
- The error messages indicate that the function is returning a status code of 422 (validation error), while the tests expect a status code of 200 (success).
- The function seems to correctly extract the values from the received body but is encountering validation errors during the processing.

### Bug Identified
- The bug seems to stem from the incorrect handling of non-typing sequences (list, set, tuple) in the received form data.
- When parsing these non-typing sequences, the function needs to properly handle them as they are currently leading to validation errors.

### Fix Strategy
- Update the logic to handle non-typing sequences (list, set, tuple) properly.
- When dealing with a non-typing sequence, the function should extract the values as a list and process them accordingly for validation.

### Corrected Version of the Function
```python
async def request_body_to_args(
    required_params: List[ModelField],
    received_body: Optional[Union[Dict[str, Any], FormData]],
) -> Tuple[Dict[str, Any], List[ErrorWrapper]]:
    values = {}
    errors = []
    if required_params:
        for field in required_params:
            value: Any = None
            if received_body is not None:
                if field.shape in sequence_shapes and isinstance(
                    received_body, FormData
                ):
                    value = received_body.getlist(field.alias)
                else:
                    value = received_body.get(field.alias)
                    if value is None:
                        continue
            if (
                value is None
                or (isinstance(value, list) and len(value) == 0)
            ):
                if field.required:
                    if PYDANTIC_1:
                        errors.append(
                            ErrorWrapper(MissingError(), loc=("body", field.alias))
                        )
                    else:
                        errors.append(
                            ErrorWrapper(
                                MissingError(),
                                loc=("body", field.alias),
                                config=BaseConfig,
                            )
                        )
                else:
                    values[field.name] = deepcopy(field.default)
                continue
            v_, errors_ = field.validate(value, values, loc=("body", field.alias))
            if isinstance(errors_, ErrorWrapper):
                errors.append(errors_)
            elif isinstance(errors_, list):
                errors.extend(errors_)
            else:
                values[field.name] = v_
    return values, errors
```

By updating the logic to properly handle non-typing sequences as lists, the corrected version of the function should now correctly extract and validate the values from the received form data for non-typing sequence fields. This should resolve the validation errors and allow the function to return the expected status code of 200 for the provided test cases.
