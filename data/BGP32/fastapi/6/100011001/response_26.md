### Bug Explanation
The buggy function `request_body_to_args` is designed to convert received body data into arguments based on required parameters. The function iterates over the required parameters and extracts the corresponding values from the received body. However, there are issues with handling different types of sequences (list, set, tuple) in the received body.

For each case provided:
1. The function encounters an error with the list parameter as form data. It incorrectly forms the values and errors due to a misunderstanding of how the data is structured and processed.
2. Similarly, the function fails with set parameters, leading to incorrect values and errors being appended.
3. Lastly, the tuple parameter case results in a flawed handling of the received data, causing incorrect values and errors to be created.

The main problems lie in the processing of the received body data for sequence-shaped fields and not handling different types of sequences appropriately.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, the function must correctly handle the data for sequence-shaped fields (list, set, tuple) in the received body. First, check the shape of the field and ensure that the data is extracted correctly based on the field type. Additionally, handle different sequence types separately to process the data accordingly.

### Corrected Version of the Function
```python
async def request_body_to_args(
    required_params: List[ModelField],
    received_body: Optional[Union[Dict[str, Any], FormData]],
) -> Tuple[Dict[str, Any], List[ErrorWrapper]]:
    values = {}
    errors = []
    ,sequence_shapes = [1, 2, 3]  # Define sequence shapes for lists, sets, and tuples
    sequence_types = (list, set, tuple)  # Define sequence types for lists, sets, and tuples
    sequence_shape_to_type = {1: list, 2: set, 3: tuple}  # Define mapping from shape to type

    for field in required_params:
        value = None
        field_info = get_field_info(field)
        if received_body is not None:
            if field.shape in sequence_shapes and isinstance(received_body, FormData):
                value = received_body.getlist(field.alias)
            else:
                value = received_body.get(field.alias)

        if value is None or (isinstance(field_info, params.Form) and value == ""):
            if field.required:
                errors.append(ErrorWrapper(MissingError(), loc=("body", field.alias)))
            else:
                values[field.name] = deepcopy(field.default)
            continue

        if (
            isinstance(field_info, params.File)
            and lenient_issubclass(field.type_, bytes)
            and isinstance(value, UploadFile)
        ):
            value = await value.read()
        elif (
            field.shape in sequence_shapes
            and isinstance(field_info, params.File)
            and lenient_issubclass(field.type_, bytes)
            and isinstance(value, sequence_types)
        ):
            awaitables = [sub_value.read() for sub_value in value]
            contents = await asyncio.gather(*awaitables)
            value = sequence_shape_to_type[field.shape](contents)

        v_, errors_ = field.validate(value, values, loc=("body", field.alias))
        
        if isinstance(errors_, ErrorWrapper):
            errors.append(errors_)
        elif isinstance(errors_, list):
            errors.extend(errors_)
        else:
            values[field.name] = v_

    return values, errors
```

By correctly handling the different types of sequence-shaped fields in the received body data, the corrected function should be able to parse the data accurately and prevent the errors encountered in the failing test cases.
