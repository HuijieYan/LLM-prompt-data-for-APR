### Bug Explanation
The bug in the `request_body_to_args` function arises from how non-typing sequences like lists, sets, and tuples are handled when passed as input parameters in the `received_body`. Since the function is trying to distinguish between different sequence shapes and field types, it does not address non-typing sequences properly, leading to validation errors and incorrect values being returned.

In the provided cases, the function incorrectly assigns values to `value` based on whether the `field.shape` and `field_info` correspond to sequence shapes or file uploads. This leads to the function processing the input data in a way that triggers validation errors and impedes the correct parsing and validation of form data.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to ensure correct handling of non-typing sequences like lists, sets, and tuples in the `received_body`. This involves considering these sequence types as specific cases and aligning the function's logic accordingly to accurately extract the values and apply validations.

The solution involves updating the logic related to processing non-typing sequence shapes and improving the conditional checks to correctly handle the different types and shapes of input data in `received_body`.

### Corrected Version of the Function
The code snippet below presents a corrected version of the `request_body_to_args` function that incorporates the necessary adjustments to properly handle non-typing sequences in the `received_body`.

```python
async def request_body_to_args(
    required_params: List[ModelField],
    received_body: Optional[Union[Dict[str, Any], FormData]],
) -> Tuple[Dict[str, Any], List[ErrorWrapper]]:
    values = {}
    errors = []
    for field in required_params:
        value = None
        if received_body is not None:
            field_name = field.alias if received_body.__class__.__name__ == "dict" else field.alias + "[0]"
            value = received_body.get(field_name)
        
        if value is None:
            if field.required:
                errors.append(ErrorWrapper(MissingError(), loc=("body", field.alias)))
            else:
                values[field.name] = deepcopy(field.default)
        else:
            v_, errors_ = field.validate(value, values, loc=("body", field.alias))
            if isinstance(errors_, ErrorWrapper):
                errors.append(errors_)
            elif isinstance(errors_, list):
                errors.extend(errors_)
            else:
                values[field.name] = v_
    
    return values, errors
```

This corrected version simplifies the extraction of values from the `received_body`, handles the absence of expected values appropriately, and ensures that validations are conducted accurately for the given non-typing sequences.
