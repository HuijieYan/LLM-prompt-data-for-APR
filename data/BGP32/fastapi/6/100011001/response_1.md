## Bug Analysis
Looking at the provided code and the error messages from the failing tests, it seems that the function `request_body_to_args` is not correctly handling the conversion of the received data into arguments based on the required parameters. The function is failing to extract the values from the received body correctly, leading to validation errors and incorrect status codes in the tests.

Upon analyzing the runtime values and types for the different cases, it is evident that the function is not properly handling sequences (lists, sets, tuples) in the received body when compared to the expectations of the tests.

The key issues causing the failures seem to be related to:
1. Incorrect extraction of values for sequences (lists, sets, tuples) from FormData.
2. Validation errors due to the mishandling of sequence shapes in the validation logic.
3. Missing values assignment for correctly parsed parameters.
4. Inadequate error reporting for missing or incorrect data.

## Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the function correctly extracts values for sequences from FormData, properly handles validation for different sequence types, assigns values correctly to the output dictionary, and reports errors consistently. 

### Proposed Fix
Below is the corrected version of the `request_body_to_args` function:

```python
async def request_body_to_args(
    required_params: List[ModelField],
    received_body: Optional[Union[Dict[str, Any], FormData]],
) -> Tuple[Dict[str, Any], List[ErrorWrapper]]:
    values = {}
    errors = []
    
    for field in required_params:
        value: Any = None
        if received_body is not None:
            if field.shape in sequence_shapes and isinstance(received_body, FormData):
                if field.alias not in received_body.keys():
                    continue
                if field.shape == 1:
                    value = received_body.getlist(field.alias)
                elif field.shape == 2:
                    value = set(received_body.getlist(field.alias))
                elif field.shape == 3:
                    value = tuple(received_body.getlist(field.alias))
            else:
                value = received_body.get(field.alias)

        v_, errors_ = field.validate(value, values, loc=("body", field.alias))
        if isinstance(errors_, ErrorWrapper):
            errors.append(errors_)
        elif isinstance(errors_, list):
            errors.extend(errors_)
        else:
            values[field.name] = v_

    return values, errors
```

This correction includes the following changes:
1. Update the logic for extracting sequence values from FormData based on the field shape.
2. Simplify the handling of sequence shapes in the validation step.
3. Properly assign validated values to the output dictionary.
4. Ensure consistent error handling and reporting.

Please try running the failing tests again with this corrected version to check if the issue is resolved.
