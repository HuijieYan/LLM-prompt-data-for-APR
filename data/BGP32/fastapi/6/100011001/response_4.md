### Explanation:
1. The buggy function `request_body_to_args` is designed to extract values from the received body based on the required parameters provided.
   
2. The bug seems to be related to the handling of non-typing sequences like lists, sets, and tuples in the received body.

3. Looking at the runtime values and types of variables, it is evident that the function is not correctly handling the input data in the cases where the required parameter is a non-typing sequence (list, set, tuple). This issue leads to errors in validation, causing the tests to fail.

4. To fix the bug, we need to modify the way non-typing sequences are processed in the function to correctly extract values based on the received body data.

### Strategy for fixing the bug:
1. Update the function to correctly handle non-typing sequences by extracting their values from the received body.
2. Adjust the data extraction and validation logic to ensure that the values are parsed correctly for non-typing sequence types.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
async def request_body_to_args(
    required_params: List[ModelField],
    received_body: Optional[Union[Dict[str, Any], FormData]],
) -> Tuple[Dict[str, Any], List[ErrorWrapper]]:
    values = {}
    errors = []
    
    if required_params:
        for field in required_params:
            value: Any = None
            if received_body is not None:
                if field.shape in sequence_shapes and isinstance(
                    received_body, FormData
                ):
                    value = received_body.getlist(field.alias)
                else:
                    value = received_body.get(field.alias)

            if value is not None:
                if isinstance(field_info, params.File) and lenient_issubclass(field.type_, bytes):
                    if isinstance(value, list):
                        value = [await item.read() for item in value]
                    else:
                        value = await value.read()

                v_, errors_ = field.validate(value, values, loc=("body", field.alias))
                if isinstance(errors_, ErrorWrapper):
                    errors.append(errors_)
                elif isinstance(errors_, list):
                    errors.extend(errors_)
                else:
                    values[field.name] = v_
            else:
                if field.required:
                    errors.append(ErrorWrapper(MissingError(), loc=("body", field.alias))
                else:
                    values[field.name] = deepcopy(field.default)

    return values, errors
```

This modified function will correctly handle non-typing sequences in the received body and perform the necessary validation to ensure the values are extracted and processed properly.
