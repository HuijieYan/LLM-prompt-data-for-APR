### Fixing the Bug

#### Issue:
The bug in the `request_body_to_args` function arises from how it handles sequence data types such as list, set, and tuple when passed as form data (FormData). The function incorrectly processes the received values and generates the wrong errors, leading to failed tests.

#### Cause of the Bug:
When the function encounters a sequence field in the `required_params`, it tries to extract the values based on the field's alias. However, it fails to iterate over all the values associated with that alias in the FormData, resulting in only the last value being considered. This causes issues with validation and error generation.

#### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, the function needs to correctly handle sequence data types and extract all values associated with the field's alias from the FormData. It should iterate over all values for the field, validate them individually, and aggregate the results accordingly.

### Corrected Version of the Function

```python
async def request_body_to_args(
    required_params: List[ModelField],
    received_body: Optional[Union[Dict[str, Any], FormData]],
) -> Tuple[Dict[str, Any], List[ErrorWrapper]]:
    values = {}
    errors = []
    if required_params:
        for field in required_params:
            values[field.name] = None
            if received_body is not None:
                if field.shape in sequence_shapes and isinstance(received_body, FormData):
                    field_values = received_body.getlist(field.alias)
                else:
                    field_values = [received_body.get(field.alias)]
                
                for value in field_values:
                    if value is None or (isinstance(get_field_info(field), params.Form) and value == ""):
                        if field.required:
                            errors.append(ErrorWrapper(MissingError(), loc=("body", field.alias)))
                        else:
                            values[field.name] = deepcopy(field.default)
                    else:
                        if isinstance(get_field_info(field), params.File) and lenient_issubclass(field.type_, bytes) and isinstance(value, UploadFile):
                            value = await value.read()
                        v_, errors_ = field.validate(value, values, loc=("body", field.alias))
                        if isinstance(errors_, ErrorWrapper):
                            errors.append(errors_)
                        elif isinstance(errors_, list):
                            errors.extend(errors_)
                        else:
                            values[field.name] = v_
    return values, errors
```

By iterating over all values associated with the provided alias and validating each one individually, this corrected version of the function ensures that all values are properly processed. This should resolve the issues with sequence types in form data and allow the function to generate the correct output for the failing tests.
