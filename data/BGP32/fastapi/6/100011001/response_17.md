### Bug Explanation
The bug in the `request_body_to_args` function occurs due to how the function handles sequences (list, set, tuple) in the received body data. When the function receives FormData with multiple values for the same key (e.g., 'items'), it incorrectly processes the values as standalone strings rather than as a sequence. This leads to incorrect validation and error generation, causing the tests to fail with a 422 status code instead of the expected 200.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to modify the logic within the function to properly handle sequence data in the received body. This involves detecting when a field in the `required_params` list is a sequence type and ensuring that the values are extracted correctly to match the expected sequence type.

### Corrected Version of the Function
Here's the corrected version of the `request_body_to_args` function with the bug fixed:

```python
async def request_body_to_args(
    required_params: List[ModelField],
    received_body: Optional[Union[Dict[str, Any], FormData]],
) -> Tuple[Dict[str, Any], List[ErrorWrapper]]:
    values = {}
    errors = []

    if required_params:
        field = required_params[0]
        field_info = get_field_info(field)
        embed = getattr(field_info, "embed", None)

        if len(required_params) == 1 and not embed:
            received_body = {field.alias: received_body}

        for field in required_params:
            value: Any = None
            if received_body is not None:
                if field.shape in sequence_shapes and isinstance(
                    received_body, FormData
                ):
                    value = received_body.getlist(field.alias)
                else:
                    value = received_body.get(field.alias)

            if value is None:
                if field.required:
                    errors.append(
                        ErrorWrapper(MissingError(), loc=("body", field.alias))
                    )
                else:
                    values[field.name] = deepcopy(field.default)
                continue

            # Handle sequence shapes (list, set, tuple)
            if field.shape in sequence_shapes:
                if not isinstance(value, list):
                    value = [value]

            v_, errors_ = field.validate(value, {}, loc=("body", field.alias))
            if isinstance(errors_, list):
                errors.extend(errors_)
            else:
                values[field.name] = v_

    return values, errors
```

This corrected version includes an additional check to convert single values into lists for sequence shapes and ensure that the validation is performed correctly for sequences. After applying this fix, the function should process sequence types in the received body data accurately, resolving the failing tests.
