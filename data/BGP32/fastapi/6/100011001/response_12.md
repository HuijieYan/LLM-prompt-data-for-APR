### Bug Explanation:

Looking at the cases and the function itself, we can see that the bug occurs when handling non-typing sequences like lists, sets, and tuples as form data in FastAPI. The function `request_body_to_args` is responsible for converting received form data into arguments based on required parameters. The bug arises from how the function processes non-typing sequences within the form data.

For non-typing sequences like lists, sets, and tuples, the function incorrectly treats them as singular values and raises validation errors since it expects data in a different structure. This results in a status code of 422 (validation error) instead of the expected 200 (success) in the tests.

### Bug Fix Strategy:

To fix the bug, we need to modify the logic of how non-typing sequences are handled within the `request_body_to_args` function. Non-typing sequences should be processed correctly in accordance with their structure to ensure validation errors are not triggered when processing form data.

### Corrected Version of the Function:

Here is the corrected version of the `request_body_to_args` function that addresses the bug:

```python
async def request_body_to_args(
    required_params: List[ModelField],
    received_body: Optional[Union[Dict[str, Any], FormData]],
) -> Tuple[Dict[str, Any], List[ErrorWrapper]]:
    values = {}
    errors = []

    if required_params:
        field = required_params[0]
        field_info = get_field_info(field)
        embed = getattr(field_info, "embed", None)

        for field in required_params:
            value: Any = None

            if received_body is not None:
                value = received_body.getlist(field.alias) if isinstance(received_body, FormData) else received_body.get(field.alias)

            if value is None or isinstance(field_info, params.Form):
                if field.required:
                    errors.append(ErrorWrapper(MissingError(), loc=("body", field.alias))
                else:
                    values[field.name] = deepcopy(field.default)
            else:
                if isinstance(field_info, params.File) and lenient_issubclass(field.type_, bytes) and isinstance(value, UploadFile):
                    value = await value.read()
                v_, errors_ = field.validate(value, values, loc=("body", field.alias))
                
                if isinstance(errors_, ErrorWrapper):
                    errors.append(errors_)
                elif isinstance(errors_, list):
                    errors.extend(errors_)
                else:
                    values[field.name] = v_
    
    return values, errors
```

By making these changes, the function should now correctly handle non-typing sequences within the form data and prevent incorrect validation errors from being raised. This corrected version should allow the failing tests to pass with a status code of 200 as expected.
