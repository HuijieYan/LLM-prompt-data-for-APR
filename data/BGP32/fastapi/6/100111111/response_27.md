Based on the analysis of the buggy function and failed tests, we can see that the function `request_body_to_args` fails to correctly handle the case where multiple values are submitted with the same key in the form data. As a result, the function only captures the last value submitted for a key, leading to validation errors. This issue is evident in the failed tests that expect multiple values for a single key in the request body.

To fix the bug in the `request_body_to_args` function, we need to modify the logic to correctly handle multiple values for the same key in the form data. We should update the function to extract and store all values associated with a key when there are duplicate keys. This adjustment will ensure that all values are passed correctly for validation, satisfying the requirements set by the failed tests.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
async def request_body_to_args(
    required_params: List[ModelField],
    received_body: Optional[Union[Dict[str, Any], FormData]],
) -> Tuple[Dict[str, Any], List[ErrorWrapper]]:
    values = {}
    errors = []
    if required_params:
        for field in required_params:
            value = None
            if received_body is not None:
                if field.shape in sequence_shapes and isinstance(received_body, FormData):
                    value = received_body.getlist(field.alias)
                else:
                    value = received_body.get(field.alias)
                
                v_, errors_ = field.validate(value, values, loc=("body", field.alias))
                
                if isinstance(errors_, ErrorWrapper):
                    errors.append(errors_)
                elif isinstance(errors_, list):
                    errors.extend(errors_)
                else:
                    values[field.name] = v_
                
    return values, errors
```

This corrected version of the function should now properly extract and store all values associated with a key when there are duplicates in the form data. This change will ensure that the function handles multiple values for a single key correctly.

By applying this modification, the function should now pass the previously failed tests and satisfy the expected input/output values, resolving the issue reported on GitHub related to supporting repeated key=value pairs in form data.
