Based on the analysis of the buggy function and the failing test cases, it appears that the issue lies in how the values are extracted and processed from the FormData object within the `request_body_to_args` function. The function is not correctly handling cases where a single key has multiple values, resulting in validation errors and incorrect behavior.

To resolve this issue, we need to modify how the values are extracted from the FormData object when a single key contains multiple values. We should ensure that these values are collected into a list before further processing and validation.

Here is the corrected version of the `request_body_to_args` function:

```python
async def request_body_to_args(
    required_params: List[ModelField],
    received_body: Optional[Union[Dict[str, Any], FormData]],
) -> Tuple[Dict[str, Any], List[ErrorWrapper]]:
    values = {}
    errors = []

    if required_params:
        for field in required_params:
            value: Any = None
            if received_body is not None:
                if field.shape in sequence_shapes and isinstance(
                    received_body, FormData
                ):
                    values_list = received_body.getlist(field.alias)
                    if len(values_list) == 1:  # Single value, no need for a list
                        value = values_list[0]
                    else:
                        value = values_list
                else:
                    value = received_body.get(field.alias)
            
            if value is None or (
                isinstance(field_info, params.Form)
                and field.required
                and (isinstance(value, list) and len(value) == 0)
            ):
                if field.required:
                    errors.append(
                        ErrorWrapper(MissingError(), loc=("body", field.alias))
                    )
                else:
                    values[field.name] = deepcopy(field.default)
                continue
            
            if (
                isinstance(field_info, params.File)
                and lenient_issubclass(field.type_, bytes)
                and isinstance(value, UploadFile)
            ):
                value = await value.read()
            elif (
                field.shape in sequence_shapes
                and isinstance(field_info, params.File)
                and lenient_issubclass(field.type_, bytes)
                and isinstance(value, sequence_types)
            ):
                awaitables = [sub_value.read() for sub_value in value]
                contents = await asyncio.gather(*awaitables)
                value = sequence_shape_to_type[field.shape](contents)
            
            v_, errors_ = field.validate(value, values, loc=("body", field.alias))
            if isinstance(errors_, ErrorWrapper):
                errors.append(errors_)
            elif isinstance(errors_, list):
                errors.extend(errors_)
            else:
                values[field.name] = v_
    
    return values, errors
```

In the corrected version, if a field has multiple values in the FormData object, they are collected into a list before further processing. This change ensures that each field receives all its values correctly for validation. The function should now handle cases where a single key has multiple values, resolving the validation errors observed in the failing test cases.

This correction addresses the issue reported in the GitHub thread regarding supporting repeated keys in form data and processing them as lists for validation.
