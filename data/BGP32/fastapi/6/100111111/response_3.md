## Bug Analysis

### Function Analysis
- The `request_body_to_args` function is designed to convert request body parameters into a dictionary of values and a list of errors.
- The function iterates over the `required_params` list, extracting values from the `received_body` based on the parameters' aliases.
- It handles different scenarios based on the types of parameters and the shape of the values.

### Test Case Analysis
- Three test cases are provided (`test_python_list_param_as_form`, `test_python_set_param_as_form`, `test_python_tuple_param_as_form`).
- Each test sends a POST request with a form containing a list, set, or tuple as a parameter.
- The tests expect the returned values to match the input data in the JSON response and the HTTP status code to be 200.

### Issue Analysis
- The GitHub issue mentions that when multiple key-value pairs with the same key are sent in form data, only the last value is retained.
- This behavior is not suitable when using FastAPI with parameters like `list = Form(...)`, as it only considers the last value for validation.

## Bug Explanation

- The bug in the `request_body_to_args` function causes it to treat form data with repeated keys incorrectly.
- The bug can be identified in the case where the keys are repeated in form data, resulting in only the last value being considered for processing and validation.
- This behavior leads to validation errors and incorrect assignment of values to the parameters.

## Bug Fix Strategy

- To fix the bug, the function should be modified to handle repeated keys in form data and process them as expected.
- By accumulating values for repeated keys as lists before validation, the function can correctly parse and validate form data with multiple values for the same key.

## Bugfix Implementation

```python
async def request_body_to_args(
    required_params: List[ModelField],
    received_body: Optional[Union[Dict[str, Any], FormData]],
) -> Tuple[Dict[str, Any], List[ErrorWrapper]]:
    values = {}
    errors = []
    if required_params:
        field_values = {}
        for field in required_params:
            if received_body is not None and field.alias in received_body:
                value = received_body.getlist(field.alias)
                field_values[field.alias] = value

        for field in required_params:
            value = field_values.get(field.alias)
            if value is None or value == "" or len(value) == 0:
                if field.required:
                    errors.append(ErrorWrapper(MissingError(), loc=("body", field.alias)))
                else:
                    values[field.name] = deepcopy(field.default)
                continue

            v_, errors_ = field.validate(value, values, loc=("body", field.alias))
            if isinstance(errors_, ErrorWrapper):
                errors.append(errors_)
            elif isinstance(errors_, list):
                errors.extend(errors_)
            else:
                values[field.name] = v_

    return values, errors
```

By accumulating values for repeated keys in the `field_values` dictionary, the fixed function processes form data correctly, considering all values for each key. This approach ensures that validation and assignment of values operate as expected for form data with repeated keys.
