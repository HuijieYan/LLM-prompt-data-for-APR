## Bug Explanation
The buggy function `request_body_to_args` is designed to extract values from the received request body based on the required parameters provided and return a dictionary of values and a list of errors. The bug in the function causes issues with extracting and processing data from forms with parameters that are lists, sets, or tuples, resulting in validation errors.

The main cause of the bug is the handling of how values are extracted from form data with multiple occurrences of the same key. When the received body is a `FormData` object with repeated keys, the function incorrectly processes the values, leading to errors in validation and ultimately producing incorrect results. This incorrect processing prevents the function from capturing the full list, set, or tuple from the form data.

## Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug and address the issue described, the function needs to be modified to handle form data with repeated keys properly. The fix involves checking for and handling repeated keys to capture all values associated with a single key before processing them.

By modifying the function to correctly handle repeated keys in form data and ensuring that all values related to the keys are extracted and processed correctly, we can resolve the validation errors and provide the expected results for forms with list, set, or tuple parameters.

## Corrected Version of the Function
```python
async def request_body_to_args(
    required_params: List[ModelField],
    received_body: Optional[Union[Dict[str, Any], FormData]],
) -> Tuple[Dict[str, Any], List[ErrorWrapper]]:
    values = {}
    errors = []
    
    if received_body is not None and isinstance(received_body, FormData):
        values_dict = received_body.multi_items()
        received_body = {key: [value for _, value in values_dict if key == _] for key, _ in values_dict}
        
    for field in required_params:
        value = None
        if received_body is not None:
            if field.shape in sequence_shapes and isinstance(received_body, FormData):
                value = received_body.getlist(field.alias)
            else:
                value = received_body.get(field.alias)

        if value is None or (isinstance(field_info, params.Form) and value == "") \
                or (isinstance(field_info, params.Form) and field.shape in sequence_shapes and len(value) == 0):
            if field.required:
                if PYDANTIC_1:
                    errors.append(ErrorWrapper(MissingError(), loc=("body", field.alias)))
                else:  # pragma: nocover
                    errors.append(ErrorWrapper(MissingError(), loc=("body", field.alias), config=BaseConfig))
            else:
                values[field.name] = deepcopy(field.default)
            continue

        if isinstance(field_info, params.File) and lenient_issubclass(field.type_, bytes) and isinstance(value, UploadFile):
            value = await value.read()
        elif field.shape in sequence_shapes and isinstance(field_info, params.File) and lenient_issubclass(field.type_, bytes) and isinstance(value, sequence_types):
            awaitables = [sub_value.read() for sub_value in value]
            contents = await asyncio.gather(*awaitables)
            value = sequence_shape_to_type[field.shape](contents)

        v_, errors_ = field.validate(value, values, loc=("body", field.alias))
        if isinstance(errors_, ErrorWrapper):
            errors.append(errors_)
        elif isinstance(errors_, list):
            errors.extend(errors_)
        else:
            values[field.name] = v_

    return values, errors
```

By updating the function to correctly handle repeated keys in form data when the received body is a `FormData` object, the corrected version ensures that all values associated with the same key are captured and processed accordingly. This fix should address the validation errors and allow the function to produce the expected results for forms with list, set, or tuple parameters.
