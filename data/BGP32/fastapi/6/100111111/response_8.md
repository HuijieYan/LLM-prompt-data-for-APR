## Bug Understanding and Fix Strategy
1. The buggy function `request_body_to_args` is responsible for converting request body data into arguments based on required parameters and received body.
2. The bug occurs due to incorrect handling of lists, sets, and tuples inside the function when processing form data.
3. Since the issue from GitHub suggests supporting repeated key=value pairs in form data, we need to modify the function to handle such scenarios correctly.
4. The current function does not handle repeated values for the same key properly, leading to validation errors.
5. To fix the bug, we need to update the function to correctly process repeated keys and assign corresponding values as lists, sets, or tuples based on the parameter type.

## Bug Fix
Here is the corrected version of the `request_body_to_args` function:

```python
async def request_body_to_args(
    required_params: List[ModelField],
    received_body: Optional[Union[Dict[str, Any], FormData]],
) -> Tuple[Dict[str, Any], List[ErrorWrapper]]:
    values = {}
    errors = []
    
    if required_params and received_body:
        repeated_keys = {}
        
        for field in required_params:
            value = received_body.getlist(field.alias)
            if value:
                # Handle repeated values for the same key
                if len(value) > 1:
                    repeated_keys[field.alias] = value
                    continue
                
                value = value[0]
                
                if isinstance(field.type_, list):
                    values[field.name] = [value]
                elif isinstance(field.type_, set):
                    values[field.name] = {value}
                elif isinstance(field.type_, tuple):
                    values[field.name] = (value,)
                else:
                    values[field.name] = value
    
    if repeated_keys:
        for key, value in repeated_keys.items():
            field = next((f for f in required_params if f.alias == key), None)
            if field:
                if isinstance(field.type_, list):
                    values[field.name] = value
                elif isinstance(field.type_, set):
                    values[field.name] = set(value)
                elif isinstance(field.type_, tuple):
                    values[field.name] = tuple(value)

    return values, errors
```

In the fixed version:
- Repeated keys are handled by storing them in a separate dictionary `repeated_keys`.
- Non-repeated values are assigned directly to the values dictionary.
- After processing all fields, the function checks for repeated keys and assigns corresponding values as lists, sets, or tuples based on the parameter type.

This correction should resolve the issues related to handling lists, sets, and tuples in form data and align with the expected behavior mentioned in the GitHub issue.
