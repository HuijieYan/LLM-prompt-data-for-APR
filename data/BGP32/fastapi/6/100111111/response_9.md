Based on the analysis of the buggy function and the failing test cases, we can identify the following issues:

1. The function incorrectly assigns values to the `received_body` dictionary when processing lists, sets, and tuples from form data.
2. The function fails to handle repeated keys properly, leading to validation errors.

To fix these issues, we need to modify the logic in the `request_body_to_args` function to correctly handle repeated keys in form data and populate the values accordingly.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
async def request_body_to_args(
    required_params: List[ModelField],
    received_body: Optional[Union[Dict[str, Any], FormData]],
) -> Tuple[Dict[str, Any], List[ErrorWrapper]]:
    values = {}
    errors = []
    
    if received_body is None:
        received_body = {}
    
    for field in required_params:
        value: Any = None
        
        # Check if the field alias is in the received body
        if field.alias in received_body:
            value = received_body.getlist(field.alias) if isinstance(received_body, FormData) else received_body.get(field.alias)
            
        if value is None and field.required:
            errors.append(ErrorWrapper(MissingError(), loc=("body", field.alias)))
        else:
            if field.shape in sequence_shapes:
                # Convert value to list or set if needed
                if field.type_ in (list, set):
                    value = [v.decode() if isinstance(v, bytes) else v for v in value]
                    # Convert set to list for consistent validation
                    if field.type_ == set:
                        value = list(set(value))
                # Handle tuples by converting to tuple type
                elif field.type_ == tuple:
                    value = tuple(value)
            elif isinstance(field_info, params.File) and lenient_issubclass(field.type_, bytes) and isinstance(value, UploadFile):
                value = await value.read()
            
            v_, errors_ = field.validate(value, values, loc=("body", field.alias))
            if isinstance(errors_, ErrorWrapper):
                errors.append(errors_)
            elif isinstance(errors_, list):
                errors.extend(errors_)
            else:
                values[field.alias] = v_
    
    return values, errors
```

With this corrected version, the function now properly handles repeated keys in form data and converts them to lists, sets, or tuples depending on the field type. This solution addresses the issues identified and should pass the failing test cases related to Python lists, sets, and tuples in form data. Feel free to test this corrected version with the failing test cases to ensure that the issues have been resolved.
