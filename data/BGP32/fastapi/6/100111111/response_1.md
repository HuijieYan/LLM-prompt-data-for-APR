## Bug Explanation:

### Issue:
The buggy function `request_body_to_args` fails to correctly handle form data with repeated keys, causing validation issues when the keys should result in a list, set, or tuple in the output.

### Cause of the Bug:
1. The function handles form data with repeated keys incorrectly by only considering the last value of the key instead of collecting all values into a list, set, or tuple.
2. This incorrect handling leads to validation errors as only the last value is used for validation, causing the function to return errors instead of the expected output.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, the function needs to correctly handle form data with repeated keys by collecting all values associated with the same key into a list, set, or tuple for validation and output.

### Proposed Fix:
I will modify the function to properly handle form data with repeated keys and ensure that the function can parse and validate the keys as lists, sets, or tuples based on the field type specified.

Here is the corrected version of the `request_body_to_args` function:

```python
async def request_body_to_args(
    required_params: List[ModelField],
    received_body: Optional[Union[Dict[str, Any], FormData]],
) -> Tuple[Dict[str, Any], List[ErrorWrapper]]:
    values = {}
    errors = []
    
    if required_params:
        for field in required_params:
            value: Any = None
            if received_body is not None:
                if field.shape in sequence_shapes and isinstance(received_body, FormData):
                    if field.alias in received_body:
                        value = received_body.getlist(field.alias)
                    else:
                        value = field.default
                else:
                    value = received_body.get(field.alias, field.default)

            v_, errors_ = field.validate(value, values, loc=("body", field.alias))
            if isinstance(errors_, ErrorWrapper):
                errors.append(errors_)
            elif isinstance(errors_, list):
                errors.extend(errors_)
            else:
                values[field.name] = v_

    return values, errors
```

This corrected version should now handle form data with repeated keys correctly and process them as lists, sets, or tuples based on the field type provided, resolving the validation issues and aligning with the expected input/output values.
