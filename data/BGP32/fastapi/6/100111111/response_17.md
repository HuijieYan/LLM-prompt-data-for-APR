## Bug Explanation

The buggy function `request_body_to_args` fails to correctly handle cases where form data contains repeated keys with lists, sets, or tuples as expected types. The function only processes the last value of a repeated key in form data and does not aggregate all values into the expected list, set, or tuple.

### Issues Identified:
1. The function incorrectly handles repeated key-value pairs for form data that should result in a list, set, or tuple.
2. It only considers the last value in the repeated keys, leading to validation errors and incorrect data processing.

### Bug Cause:
The bug arises from the logic that processes field data from form data input. When encountering repeated keys in form data, the function overlooks accumulating those values and only retrieves the last value, causing the data structure to be incorrect.

### Strategy to Fix the Bug:
To resolve the bug, the function needs to identify and aggregate all values associated with repeated keys in form data appropriately before validation. It should store these values in the correct format (list, set, or tuple) based on the expected data structure according to the input parameters.

## Corrected Function

Here is the corrected version of the `request_body_to_args` function that addresses the identified bug:

```python
async def request_body_to_args(
    required_params: List[ModelField],
    received_body: Optional[Union[Dict[str, Any], FormData]],
) -> Tuple[Dict[str, Any], List[ErrorWrapper]]:
    values = {}
    errors = []

    for field in required_params:
        value = None
        if received_body is not None:
            if field.shape in sequence_shapes and isinstance(received_body, FormData):
                values[field.name] = received_body.getlist(field.alias)
            else:
                values[field.name] = received_body.get(field.alias)

        if values[field.name] is None:
            if field.required:
                if PYDANTIC_1:
                    errors.append(
                        ErrorWrapper(MissingError(), loc=("body", field.alias))
                    )
                else:
                    errors.append(
                        ErrorWrapper(
                            MissingError(),
                            loc=("body", field.alias),
                            config=BaseConfig,
                        )
                    )
            else:
                values[field.name] = deepcopy(field.default)
        else:
            v_, errors_ = field.validate(values[field.name], values, loc=("body", field.alias))
            if isinstance(errors_, ErrorWrapper):
                errors.append(errors_)
            elif isinstance(errors_, list):
                errors.extend(errors_)
            else:
                values[field.name] = v_

    return values, errors
```

This corrected version ensures that all values associated with repeated keys in form data are accumulated correctly and stored in the expected format (list, set, tuple), resolving the issue with handling repeated keys in form data as per the provided failing tests.
