### Potential Error Locations
1. The conditional check for `sequence_shapes` might not be handling the form data with repeated values correctly.
2. The logic for assigning values to the `values` dictionary and handling errors could lead to discrepancies in handling repeated keys in form data.
3. The validation process for fields based on the submitted values might not be handling repeated keys accurately.

### Cause of the Bug
The issue arises from the function `request_body_to_args` not handling repeated keys in form data correctly. The current implementation may only consider the last value for a key in form data with repeated values. This behavior contradicts the expected functionality where repeated keys should be collected as lists before validation.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug
To address this bug and align with the GitHub issue's request, the function needs to be updated to handle repeated keys in form data appropriately. Specifically, the function should collect all values associated with a key as a list before validation. This change will ensure that all submitted values for a key are considered during the validation process.

### Corrected Version of the Buggy Function
Here is the corrected version of the `request_body_to_args` function:

```python
async def request_body_to_args(
    required_params: List[ModelField],
    received_body: Optional[Union[Dict[str, Any], FormData]],
) -> Tuple[Dict[str, Any], List[ErrorWrapper]]:
    values = {}
    errors = []
    
    if required_params:
        # Collect all values for each key as a list
        # Handle the case where a key may have multiple values
        received_data = {}
        for key, value in received_body.items():
            if key not in received_data:
                received_data[key] = [value]
            else:
                received_data[key].append(value)
        
        for field in required_params:
            value = received_data.get(field.alias)
            
            # Proceed with the usual logic for assigning values and handling errors
            if value is None or (isinstance(field_info, params.Form) and value == "") or (
                isinstance(field_info, params.Form) and field.shape in sequence_shapes and len(value) == 0
            ):
                if field.required:
                    if PYDANTIC_1:
                        errors.append(ErrorWrapper(MissingError(), loc=("body", field.alias)))
                    else:
                        errors.append(
                            ErrorWrapper(
                                MissingError(),
                                loc=("body", field.alias),
                                config=BaseConfig,
                            )
                        )
                else:
                    values[field.name] = deepcopy(field.default)
                continue
            
            if (
                isinstance(field_info, params.File)
                and lenient_issubclass(field.type_, bytes)
                and isinstance(value, UploadFile)
            ):
                value = await value.read()
            elif (
                field.shape in sequence_shapes
                and isinstance(field_info, params.File)
                and lenient_issubclass(field.type_, bytes)
                and isinstance(value, sequence_types)
            ):
                awaitables = [sub_value.read() for sub_value in value]
                contents = await asyncio.gather(*awaitables)
                value = sequence_shape_to_type[field.shape](contents)
            
            v_, errors_ = field.validate(value, values, loc=("body", field.alias))
            if isinstance(errors_, ErrorWrapper):
                errors.append(errors_)
            elif isinstance(errors_, list):
                errors.extend(errors_)
            else:
                values[field.name] = v_
    
    return values, errors
```

### Explanation
The corrected version now collects all values associated with a key as a list in the `received_data` dictionary. This change ensures that all values for repeated keys are considered during the validation process. The rest of the function remains the same, handling values, errors, and validations as before. 

By making this adjustment, the function now aligns with the expected behavior outlined in the GitHub issue and should resolve the bug with handling repeated keys in form data.
