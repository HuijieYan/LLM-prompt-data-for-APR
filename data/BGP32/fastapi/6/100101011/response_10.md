### Analysis
1. The `request_body_to_args` function is responsible for extracting values from the request body based on the provided required parameters and processing them to return values and errors.
2. The bug seems to occur when handling form data with repeated keys, causing only the last key=value pair to be processed.
3. The issue reported on GitHub suggests that repeated key=value pairs in form data should be collected and assigned as a list before validation.
4. The current function implementation only considers the last value for repeated keys, leading to incorrect validation results.

### Bug Cause
1. The bug arises from the handling of repeated keys in Form Data in the `request_body_to_args` function.
2. When processing a FormData with repeated keys, only the last value for each key is considered, leading to incorrect validation results and missing data.
3. This issue directly impacts the tests involving Python list, set, and tuple parameters passed through form data and the processing of repeated keys.

### Fix Strategy
1. To resolve the bug, we need to modify the logic for handling repeated keys in the `request_body_to_args` function to collect all values for the same key and process them as a list before validation.
2. Update the logic to properly handle repeated keys in FormData and ensure that all values are captured and validated correctly.
3. Implement the solution suggested in the GitHub issue regarding collecting repeated key=value pairs in FormData before validation.

### Updated Corrected Version of the Function
```python
async def request_body_to_args(
    required_params: List[ModelField],
    received_body: Optional[Union[Dict[str, Any], FormData]],
) -> Tuple[Dict[str, Any], List[ErrorWrapper]]:
    values = {}
    errors = []
    if required_params:
        for field in required_params:
            if received_body is not None:
                values[field.name] = []
                for key, value in received_body.items():
                    if key == field.alias:
                        if field.shape in sequence_shapes and isinstance(value, list):
                            values[field.name].extend(value)
                        else:
                            values[field.name].append(value)
            else:
                if field.required:
                    if PYDANTIC_1:
                        errors.append(
                            ErrorWrapper(MissingError(), loc=("body", field.alias))
                        )
                    else:
                        errors.append(
                            ErrorWrapper(MissingError(), loc=("body", field.alias), config=BaseConfig)
                        )
                else:
                    values[field.name] = deepcopy(field.default)
    return values, errors
```

By modifying the function as shown above, we collect all values for the same key in FormData, allowing for correct processing and validation of repeated key=value pairs. This updated logic ensures that all values are captured and processed correctly, resolving the bug related to repeated keys in form data.
