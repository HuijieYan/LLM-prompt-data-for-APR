### Bug Analysis:
The buggy function `request_body_to_args` fails to handle repeated keys in form data correctly, leading to validation errors when trying to process Python list, set, or tuple parameters as form data.

1. The function doesn't account for handling repeated keys in the form data.
2. It incorrectly processes form data containing repeated keys by only considering the last value associated with each key.
3. This results in validation errors, especially when dealing with Python list, set, or tuple parameters.

### Bug Cause:
The cause of the bug stems from the function's assumption that form data contains unique keys without considering the possibility of repeated keys. When receiving form data with repeated keys, the function only captures the last value associated with each key, leading to validation errors.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug and address the GitHub issue:
1. Modify the function to correctly handle repeated keys in form data by collecting all values associated with each key.
2. Update the logic to process repeated keys in form data for Python list, set, and tuple parameters appropriately.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
Here is the corrected version of the `request_body_to_args` function:

```python
async def request_body_to_args(
    required_params: List[ModelField],
    received_body: Optional[Union[Dict[str, Any], FormData]],
) -> Tuple[Dict[str, Any], List[ErrorWrapper]]:
    values = {}
    errors = []
    if required_params:
        field = required_params[0]
        field_info = get_field_info(field)
        embed = getattr(field_info, "embed", None)
        if len(required_params) == 1 and not embed:
            received_body = {field.alias: received_body}
        for field in required_params:
            value: Any = None
            if received_body is not None:
                if field.shape in sequence_shapes and isinstance(
                    received_body, FormData
                ):
                    if field.alias in received_body:
                        value = received_body.getlist(field.alias)
                    else:
                        value = []
                else:
                    value = received_body.get(field.alias)
           # rest of the original code remains here
```

By modifying the code to check for repeated keys in form data and collecting all associated values, the corrected function should now handle Python list, set, and tuple parameters correctly when processed as form data.
