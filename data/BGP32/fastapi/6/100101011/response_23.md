## Bug Analysis:
The buggy function `request_body_to_args` is responsible for converting the received body data into a dictionary of values and a list of validation errors based on the required parameters. However, the bug arises when handling repeated keys in the form data, which the current implementation does not fully support.

The error is mainly caused by not properly handling repeated keys in form data when converting them to values for validation. This leads to only the last key=value pair being considered, causing incorrect validation results.

The function fails to correctly parse repeated keys, leading to validation errors due to missing data in cases where multiple values are associated with the same key.

## Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug and resolve the issue, we need to modify the function `request_body_to_args` to properly handle repeated keys in form data. This involves collecting all values associated with the same key and converting them into a list before validation.

To achieve this, we should iterate through the received form data and handle repeated keys by storing all associated values in a list. This way, the function can correctly process repeated keys and ensure that all values are considered during validation.

## Updated Corrected Function:
```python
async def request_body_to_args(
    required_params: List[ModelField],
    received_body: Optional[Union[Dict[str, Any], FormData]],
) -> Tuple[Dict[str, Any], List[ErrorWrapper]]:
    values = {}
    errors = []

    if received_body is None:
        received_body = {}

    for field in required_params:
        value_raw = received_body.getlist(field.alias)
        if not value_raw:
            if field.required:
                errors.append(ErrorWrapper(MissingError(), loc=("body", field.alias)))
            else:
                values[field.name] = deepcopy(field.default)
        else:
            value = value_raw[0] if len(value_raw) == 1 else value_raw
            if isinstance(field_info, params.File) and lenient_issubclass(field.type_, bytes):
                if isinstance(value, UploadFile):
                    value = await value.read()
                else:
                    awaitables = [sub_value.read() for sub_value in value]
                    contents = await asyncio.gather(*awaitables)
                    value = sequence_shape_to_type[field.shape](contents)
            v_, errors_ = field.validate(value, values, loc=("body", field.alias))
            if isinstance(errors_, ErrorWrapper):
                errors.append(errors_)
            elif isinstance(errors_, list):
                errors.extend(errors_)
            else:
                values[field.name] = v_

    return values, errors
```

By updating the function as above, we now properly handle repeated keys in form data and ensure that all associated values are considered during validation. This fix should resolve the bug and allow the function to pass the failing tests while addressing the issue raised in GitHub.
