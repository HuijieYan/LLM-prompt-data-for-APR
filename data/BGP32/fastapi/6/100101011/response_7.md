### Bug Analysis:
- The buggy function `request_body_to_args` is responsible for converting the received body data into arguments based on the required parameters.
- The issue arises when dealing with repeated keys in form data, where only the last key=value pair is considered.
- The issue can be seen in the failing tests that expect different types of collections like lists, sets, and tuples, but the function does not handle them correctly due to the behavior with repeated keys in form data.

### Error Location:
- The key issue lies in how the function handles repeated keys in form data and assigns the values to the fields.

### Cause of the Bug:
- The bug occurs because the function only processes the last value for a repeated key in the form data, leading to incorrect validation and assignment of values.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
- To fix the bug, the function needs to handle repeated keys in form data appropriately, aggregating the values for those keys into the corresponding fields for proper validation and assignment.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
async def request_body_to_args(
    required_params: List[ModelField],
    received_body: Optional[Union[Dict[str, Any], FormData]],
) -> Tuple[Dict[str, Any], List[ErrorWrapper]]:
    values = {}
    errors = []
    
    repeated_keys = defaultdict(list)  # Introduce a dict to store repeated keys
    
    if received_body:
        for key, value in received_body.items():
            repeated_keys[key].append(value)  # Collect all values for repeated keys
    
    for field in required_params:
        value = None
        
        # If the field alias exists in the repeated keys dict, aggregate values
        if field.alias in repeated_keys:
            value = repeated_keys[field.alias]
        
        if value is not None:
            if field.shape in sequence_shapes and isinstance(value, FormData):
                value = value.getlist(field.alias) if len(value) > 1 else value[0]
            else:
                value = value
                
            v_, errors_ = field.validate(value, values, loc=("body", field.alias))
            
            if isinstance(errors_, ErrorWrapper):
                errors.append(errors_)
            elif isinstance(errors_, list):
                errors.extend(errors_)
            else:
                values[field.name] = v_
        else:
            if field.required:
                errors.append(ErrorWrapper(MissingError(), loc=("body", field.alias))
            else:
                values[field.name] = field.default
                
    return values, errors
```

After applying the corrections, the function now correctly handles repeated keys in form data, aggregating their values to ensure proper validation and assignment of values to the corresponding fields. This updated version should resolve the issue and make the failing tests pass.
