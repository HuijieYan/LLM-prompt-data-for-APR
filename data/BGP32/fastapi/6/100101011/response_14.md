### Analyzing the buggy function and the failing test
The function `request_body_to_args` is responsible for extracting values and potential errors from the received body based on the required parameters specified. It iterates over the required parameters, extracts values from the body, validates them, and handles different scenarios like missing values or file uploads.

The failing tests are related to passing Python list, set, and tuple parameters as form data to specific endpoints. The issue arises when processing the received data and handling multiple values related to the same key in form data, leading to incorrect validation and errors.

### Identifying potential error locations within the buggy function
- The handling of repeated keys in form data might lead to incorrect behavior in the function.
- Specifically, the logic related to extracting values from `FormData` objects may not be properly handling lists or sets passed as form data.

### Explaining the cause of the bug
The buggy function is not correctly handling scenarios where multiple values are associated with the same key in the form data. This leads to unexpected behavior during value extraction, validation, and error generation. The function's handling of sequence shapes and form parameters is causing issues when dealing with repeated keys.

### Suggesting a strategy for fixing the bug
To address the bug and the related GitHub issue, the function should be modified to properly handle repeated keys in form data. This involves checking for duplicate keys, collecting all values related to a key before validation, and ensuring that the validation process considers all values.

### Corrected version of the function
```python
async def request_body_to_args(
    required_params: List[ModelField],
    received_body: Optional[Union[Dict[str, Any], FormData]],
) -> Tuple[Dict[str, Any], List[ErrorWrapper]]:
    values = {}
    errors = []
    if required_params:
        for field in required_params:
            value: Any = None
            if received_body is not None:
                if field.shape in sequence_shapes and isinstance(received_body, FormData):
                    if field.alias in received_body.keys():
                        value = received_body.getlist(field.alias)
                    else:
                        value = None
                else:
                    value = received_body.get(field.alias)
            if value is None or (isinstance(field_info, params.Form) and value == "") or (isinstance(field_info, params.Form) and field.shape in sequence_shapes and len(value) == 0):
                if field.required:
                    if PYDANTIC_1:
                        errors.append(ErrorWrapper(MissingError(), loc=("body", field.alias)))
                    else:  # pragma: nocover
                        errors.append(ErrorWrapper(MissingError(), loc=("body", field.alias), config=BaseConfig))
                else:
                    values[field.name] = deepcopy(field.default)
                continue

            if isinstance(field_info, params.File) and lenient_issubclass(field.type_, bytes) and isinstance(value, UploadFile):
                value = await value.read()
            elif field.shape in sequence_shapes and isinstance(field_info, params.File) and lenient_issubclass(field.type_, bytes) and isinstance(value, sequence_types):
                awaitables = [sub_value.read() for sub_value in value]
                contents = await asyncio.gather(*awaitables)
                value = sequence_shape_to_type[field.shape](contents)

            v_, errors_ = field.validate(value, values, loc=("body", field.alias))
            if isinstance(errors_, ErrorWrapper):
                errors.append(errors_)
            elif isinstance(errors_, list):
                errors.extend(errors_)
            else:
                values[field.name] = v_
    return values, errors
```

This corrected version of the function includes the necessary modification to handle repeated keys properly and ensure that all values associated with the key are considered during validation. This change should address the bug and allow the function to process Python list, set, and tuple parameters passed as form data accurately, resolving the failing tests and addressing the GitHub issue.
