### Analysis:
1. The `request_body_to_args` function is responsible for converting request body parameters to the appropriate arguments for endpoint functions in FastAPI.
2. The function processes required parameters and the received body data, populating the `values` dictionary and collecting errors in the `errors` list.
3. The bug seems to stem from how the function handles form data with repeated keys, causing validation issues and incorrect results.
4. The failing tests aim to process Python list, set, and tuple parameters passed as form data, which is causing errors due to the bug in the function.
5. The GitHub issue also mentions a similar problem related to repeated key=value pairs in form data.

### Bug Cause:
1. The function incorrectly processes form data with repeated keys, causing it to only pick the last value and leading to validation errors.
2. The bug arises when handling form data containing sequences (lists, sets, tuples) with multiple values for the same key.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Modify the function to correctly handle form data with repeated keys by aggregating all values into a list for the same key.
2. Update the logic to validate sequences properly, ensuring that all values are considered during validation.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
async def request_body_to_args(
    required_params: List[ModelField],
    received_body: Optional[Union[Dict[str, Any], FormData]],
) -> Tuple[Dict[str, Any], List[ErrorWrapper]]:
    values = {}
    errors = []
    for field in required_params:
        value = None
        key = field.alias
        if received_body is not None:
            if field.shape in sequence_shapes and isinstance(received_body, FormData):
                value = received_body.getlist(key)  # Get all values for the key
            else:
                value = received_body.get(key)
        if value is not None:
            if (isinstance(field_info, params.File) and lenient_issubclass(field.type_, bytes)
                and (isinstance(value, UploadFile) or isinstance(value, sequence_types))):
                value = [await v.read() if isinstance(v, UploadFile) else v for v in value]
            v_, errors_ = field.validate(value, values, loc=("body", key))
            if isinstance(errors_, ErrorWrapper):
                errors.append(errors_)
            elif isinstance(errors_, list):
                errors.extend(errors_)
            else:
                values[field.name] = v_
        else:
            if field.required:
                errors.append(ErrorWrapper(MissingError(), loc=("body", key))
            else:
                values[field.name] = deepcopy(field.default)  # Use default value if not required
    return values, errors
```

### Summary:
1. The corrected version of the `request_body_to_args` function now properly handles form data with repeated keys, aggregating all values into a list.
2. The function now follows the correct validation process for sequences, ensuring that all values are considered during validation.
3. This fix should address the test failures related to processing Python list, set, and tuple parameters as form data in FastAPI.
