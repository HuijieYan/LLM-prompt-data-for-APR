### Bug Explanation:

The buggy function `request_body_to_args` is intended to convert received request body data into arguments based on required parameters information. However, it fails to correctly handle scenarios where the input data is a Python list, set, or tuple provided as form data. The function currently only considers the last value when multiple values are sent with the same key.

In the provided failing tests, the function fails because it doesn't correctly process the list, set, or tuple input data from the form. Due to this issue, only the last value is considered, leading to validation errors or incorrect behavior.

### Bug Fix Strategy:

To fix the bug, the function needs to handle scenarios where multiple values are sent with the same key, such as when dealing with Python lists, sets, or tuples inside the form data. It should take all values into account and process them correctly to turn them into the appropriate data structures for validation.

### Corrected Version of the Function:

Here is the corrected version of the `request_body_to_args` function:

```python
async def request_body_to_args(
    required_params: List[ModelField],
    received_body: Optional[Union[Dict[str, Any], FormData]],
) -> Tuple[Dict[str, Any], List[ErrorWrapper]]:
    values = {}
    errors = []
    for field in required_params:
        value: Any = None
        if received_body is not None:
            if field.shape in sequence_shapes and isinstance(received_body, FormData):
                if field.alias in received_body.keys():
                    if field.shape == 1:
                        value = [received_body[field.alias]]
                    else:
                        value = received_body.getlist(field.alias)
            else:
                value = received_body.get(field.alias)
        if value is None:
            if field.required:
                errors.append(ErrorWrapper(MissingError(), loc=("body", field.alias)))
            else:
                values[field.name] = deepcopy(field.default)
        else:
            if isinstance(field_info, params.File) and lenient_issubclass(field.type_, bytes) and isinstance(value, UploadFile):
                value = await value.read()
            elif field.shape in sequence_shapes and isinstance(field_info, params.File) and lenient_issubclass(field.type_, bytes) and isinstance(value, sequence_types):
                awaitables = [sub_value.read() for sub_value in value]
                contents = await asyncio.gather(*awaitables)
                value = sequence_shape_to_type[field.shape](contents)
            v_, errors_ = field.validate(value, values, loc=("body", field.alias))
            if isinstance(errors_, ErrorWrapper):
                errors.append(errors_)
            elif isinstance(errors_, list):
                errors.extend(errors_)
            else:
                values[field.name] = v_
    return values, errors
```

This corrected version ensures that all values sent with the same key are considered correctly, especially in the case of Python lists, sets, and tuples, allowing validations to occur accurately based on the complete set of values. Once implemented, the function should successfully process form data containing repeated key-value pairs as described in the failing tests.
