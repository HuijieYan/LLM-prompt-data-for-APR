### Bug Explanation

The bug in the `request_body_to_args` function is related to handling form data with repeated keys like 'items', which should result in a list or set of values. However, the current implementation only considers the last value for a repeated key, leading to validation errors and incorrect data handling.

The key issue is that the function doesn't handle repeated values within a single key as lists or sets, and it doesn't properly process form data with sequence types like lists, sets, or tuples. This results in validation errors and incorrect values being assigned.

### Bug Fix Strategy

To fix the bug, the `request_body_to_args` function needs to be updated to correctly handle form data with repeated keys and differentiate between regular and sequence-shaped fields. The function should properly process repeated values and convert them into lists, sets, or tuples based on the expected type of the field.

### Corrected Version of the Function

Here is the corrected version of the `request_body_to_args` function:

```python
async def request_body_to_args(
    required_params: List[ModelField],
    received_body: Optional[Union[Dict[str, Any], FormData]],
) -> Tuple[Dict[str, Any], List[ErrorWrapper]]:
    values = {}
    errors = []
    for field in required_params:
        if received_body is not None:
            if field.shape in sequence_shapes and isinstance(received_body, FormData):
                values[field.alias] = received_body.getlist(field.alias)
            else:
                value = received_body.get(field.alias)
                if value is None:
                    if field.required:
                        errors.append(ErrorWrapper(MissingError(), loc=("body", field.alias)))
                    else:
                        values[field.name] = deepcopy(field.default)
                elif isinstance(field_info, params.File) and lenient_issubclass(field.type_, bytes) and isinstance(value, UploadFile):
                    values[field.alias] = await value.read()
                elif field.shape in sequence_shapes and isinstance(field_info, params.File) and lenient_issubclass(field.type_, bytes) and isinstance(value, sequence_types):
                    awaitables = [sub_value.read() for sub_value in value]
                    contents = await asyncio.gather(*awaitables)
                    values[field.alias] = sequence_shape_to_type[field.shape](contents)
                else:
                    v_, errors_ = field.validate(value, values, loc=("body", field.alias))
                    if isinstance(errors_, ErrorWrapper):
                        errors.append(errors_)
                    elif isinstance(errors_, list):
                        errors.extend(errors_)
                    else:
                        values[field.name] = v_
        else:
            if field.required:
                errors.append(ErrorWrapper(MissingError(), loc=("body", field.alias))
            else:
                values[field.name] = deepcopy(field.default)
    return values, errors
```

This corrected version includes proper handling of form data with repeated keys and correctly processes values as lists or sets when necessary. It distinguishes between regular and sequence-shaped fields, ensuring that the data is processed and validated correctly. This fix should address the issues with the failing tests and resolve the problem reported in the GitHub issue related to repeated key=value pairs in form data.
