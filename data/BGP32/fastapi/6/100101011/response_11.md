### Issue Analysis:
1. The buggy function `request_body_to_args` is responsible for extracting values from the received body based on the required parameters defined.
2. The function encounters issues when dealing with non-typing sequence shapes, specifically in cases where the received body is a FormData and contains repeated keys.
3. The failing tests focus on submitting data containing repeated keys (items having multiple values) and expect the function to handle these cases correctly.
4. The GitHub issue highlights the specific problem of not being able to extract all values for repeated keys from form data when using FastAPI.

### Bug Explanation:
1. The bug occurs because the function wrongly processes FormData with repeated keys. It only extracts the last value for a repeated key, causing incorrect validation and missing values.
2. In the provided test cases, the function fails to correctly handle the repeated 'items' key and misses extracting all values associated with it, leading to validation errors.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Modify the function to properly handle repeated keys in FormData, ensuring all values for a repeated key are extracted.
2. Update the logic to correctly process sequence shapes and handle cases where a key in FormData might have multiple values.
3. Adjust the validation to account for multiple values for the same key and ensure all values are included in the output.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
async def request_body_to_args(
    required_params: List[ModelField],
    received_body: Optional[Union[Dict[str, Any], FormData]],
) -> Tuple[Dict[str, Any], List[ErrorWrapper]]:
    values = {}
    errors = []
    if required_params:
        for field in required_params:
            if received_body is not None:
                if field.shape in sequence_shapes and isinstance(
                    received_body, FormData
                ):
                    # Handle repeated keys in FormData
                    values[field.name] = received_body.getlist(field.alias)
                else:
                    value = received_body.get(field.alias)
                    if value is None:
                        value = field.default
                    else:
                        if (
                            isinstance(field_info, params.File)
                            and lenient_issubclass(field.type_, bytes)
                            and isinstance(value, UploadFile)
                        ):
                            value = await value.read()
                        elif (
                            field.shape in sequence_shapes
                            and isinstance(field_info, params.File)
                            and lenient_issubclass(field.type_, bytes)
                            and isinstance(value, sequence_types)
                        ):
                            awaitables = [sub_value.read() for sub_value in value]
                            contents = await asyncio.gather(*awaitables)
                            value = sequence_shape_to_type[field.shape](contents)
                        v_, errors_ = field.validate(value, values, loc=("body", field.alias))
                        if isinstance(errors_, ErrorWrapper):
                            errors.append(errors_)
                        elif isinstance(errors_, list):
                            errors.extend(errors_)
                        else:
                            values[field.name] = v_
    return values, errors
```

By making these modifications, the corrected function addresses the issue with handling repeated keys in FormData and ensures that all values are correctly extracted and included for validation.
