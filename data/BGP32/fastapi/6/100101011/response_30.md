### Bug Analysis:
1. The `request_body_to_args` function is designed to handle converting a request body into arguments based on required parameters.
2. The bug seems to arise from the way the function handles sequence types like lists, sets, and tuples when processing the request body.
3. The function fails to properly handle the case where a sequence type is passed in the form data, leading to errors in validation and processing.

### Bug Cause:
1. In the provided test cases, the received form data contains repeated keys (e.g., "items": ["first", "second", "third"]).
2. The function incorrectly processes this repeated key-value structure, causing errors in validation and conversion.
3. The field validation for sequence shapes is not correctly handling the scenario of multiple values for the same key.
4. This issue aligns with the GitHub request for supporting repeated key-values in form data to be collected as lists for validation.

### Fix Strategy:
1. Update the logic within the `request_body_to_args` function to properly handle repeated keys in form data for sequence shapes.
2. Specifically, modify the logic related to sequence shapes and the processing of form data to correctly handle multiple values for the same key.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
async def request_body_to_args(
    required_params: List[ModelField],
    received_body: Optional[Union[Dict[str, Any], FormData]],
) -> Tuple[Dict[str, Any], List[ErrorWrapper]]:
    values = {}
    errors = []
    
    if required_params and received_body is not None:
        for field in required_params:
            value = None
            if field.shape in sequence_shapes and isinstance(received_body, FormData):
                values_list = received_body.getlist(field.alias)
                if len(values_list) == 1:
                    value = values_list[0]
                else:
                    value = values_list
            else:
                value = received_body.get(field.alias)
            
            if value is not None and value != "":
                if isinstance(field_info, params.File) and lenient_issubclass(field.type_, bytes) and isinstance(value, UploadFile):
                    value = await value.read()
                
                v_, errors_ = field.validate(value, values, loc=("body", field.alias))
                if isinstance(errors_, ErrorWrapper):
                    errors.append(errors_)
                elif isinstance(errors_, list):
                    errors.extend(errors_)
                else:
                    values[field.name] = v_
            elif field.required:
                errors.append(ErrorWrapper(MissingError(), loc=("body", field.alias)))
            else:
                values[field.name] = deepcopy(field.default)
    
    return values, errors
```

### Summary:
1. The corrected version of the `request_body_to_args` function has been updated to handle repeated keys in form data properly for sequence shapes.
2. By adjusting the logic for retrieving values from the form data and handling sequence shapes, the function now correctly processes multiple values for the same key.
3. The fixed version should now be able to pass the failing tests related to processing sequence types from form data.
