### Potential Error Locations:
1. The conversion of `received_body` to a dictionary inside the loop may overwrite the previous values.
2. Handling of sequence shapes and file uploads might not be properly integrated.
3. Error handling for missing values could lead to incorrect behavior.

### Cause of the Bug:
The bug stems from how repeated key-value pairs in form data are processed. As mentioned in the GitHub issue, only the last key-value pair is considered, which leads to validation based on that single value. This causes issues when dealing with sequences like lists, sets, or tuples as the expected type is not properly validated against the full data provided.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To address the bug:
1. Collect all values for a specific key from the `received_body` into a list if there are repeated keys.
2. When validating against a sequence type, ensure that all collected values are processed and validated correctly.
3. Adjust error handling to handle missing values in sequences appropriately.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
async def request_body_to_args(
    required_params: List[ModelField],
    received_body: Optional[Union[Dict[str, Any], FormData]],
) -> Tuple[Dict[str, Any], List[ErrorWrapper]]:
    values = {}
    errors = []

    if required_params:
        for field in required_params:
            if received_body is not None:
                if field.shape in sequence_shapes and isinstance(received_body, FormData):
                    values[field.name] = received_body.getlist(field.alias)
                else:
                    # Check for repeated keys and collect values into a list
                    values[field.name] = [received_body[key] for key in received_body.keys() if key == field.alias]

            if field.required and not values.get(field.name):
                if PYDANTIC_1:
                    errors.append(
                        ErrorWrapper(MissingError(), loc=("body", field.alias))
                    )
                else:
                    errors.append(
                        ErrorWrapper(
                            MissingError(),
                            loc=("body", field.alias),
                            config=BaseConfig,
                        )
                    )
            else:
                field_info = get_field_info(field)
                v_, errors_ = field.validate(values.get(field.name), values, loc=("body", field.alias))
                if isinstance(errors_, ErrorWrapper):
                    errors.append(errors_)
                elif isinstance(errors_, list):
                    errors.extend(errors_)
                else:
                    values[field.name] = v_

    return values, errors
```

### Changes Made:
1. Collect all values for a specific key from the `received_body` into a list when dealing with sequence types.
2. Adjust error handling to check for missing values based on the actual data collected.
3. Validate against the collected values to ensure proper handling of sequence-shaped data.

By updating the function with the suggested changes, it should now properly handle repeated key-value pairs in form data and pass the failing tests.
