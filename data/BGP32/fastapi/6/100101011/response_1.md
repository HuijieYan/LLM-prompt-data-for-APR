### Bug Analysis
The `request_body_to_args` function is designed to process required parameters and received body data to extract values and errors. The bug seems to occur when handling form data with repeated keys, such as `choices=parrot&choices=spider`, where only the last key=value pair is considered, leading to incorrect validation outcomes.

The bug is likely related to how the function processes form data and the logic surrounding handling repeated keys.

### Error Location
The issue likely arises from how the function handles form data elements with multiple values for the same key and may not correctly aggregate them before validation.

### Cause of the Bug
1. The function is not properly handling form data structures like `FormData` with repeated keys.
2. It only considers the last value of a repeated key, leading to incorrect validation issues.
3. The logic to process sequence shapes and repeated keys needs to be revised to correctly parse and aggregate values before validation.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To address this bug, a revised logic for handling form data with repeated keys is necessary. The function should aggregate values for duplicate keys and treat them as a list to enable accurate validation.

### Corrected Function
```python
async def request_body_to_args(
    required_params: List[ModelField],
    received_body: Optional[Union[Dict[str, Any], FormData]],
) -> Tuple[Dict[str, Any], List[ErrorWrapper]]:
    values = {}
    errors = []
    if required_params:
        for field in required_params:
            values[field.name] = []
            value: Any = None
            if received_body is not None:
                if field.shape in sequence_shapes and isinstance(received_body, FormData):
                    values[field.name] = received_body.getlist(field.alias)
                else:
                    values[field.name] = [received_body.get(field.alias)]
            for index, val in enumerate(values[field.name]):
                if (
                    val is None
                    or (isinstance(field_info, params.Form) and val == "")
                    or (
                        isinstance(field_info, params.Form)
                        and field.shape in sequence_shapes
                        and len(val) == 0
                    )
                ):
                    if field.required:
                        if PYDANTIC_1:
                            errors.append(
                                ErrorWrapper(MissingError(), loc=("body", field.alias))
                            )
                        else:  # pragma: nocover
                            errors.append(
                                ErrorWrapper(
                                    MissingError(), loc=("body", field.alias), config=BaseConfig,
                                )
                            )
                    else:
                        values[field.name][index] = deepcopy(field.default)
                    continue
                if (
                    isinstance(field_info, params.File)
                    and lenient_issubclass(field.type_, bytes)
                    and isinstance(val, UploadFile)
                ):
                    values[field.name][index] = await val.read()
                elif (
                    field.shape in sequence_shapes
                    and isinstance(field_info, params.File)
                    and lenient_issubclass(field.type_, bytes)
                    and isinstance(val, sequence_types)
                ):
                    awaitables = [sub_value.read() for sub_value in val]
                    contents = await asyncio.gather(*awaitables)
                    values[field.name] = sequence_shape_to_type[field.shape](contents)
                v_, errors_ = field.validate(val, values, loc=("body", field.alias))
                if isinstance(errors_, ErrorWrapper):
                    errors.append(errors_)
                elif isinstance(errors_, list):
                    errors.extend(errors_)
                else:
                    values[field.name][index] = v_
    return values, errors
```

In the corrected version, keys with multiple values are aggregated into lists, enabling accurate validation against all values for the same key. This fix should address the issue reported on GitHub and ensure correct handling of form data with repeated keys.
