## Bug Explanation

The buggy function `request_body_to_args` is designed to convert received body data into arguments based on the required parameters provided. However, the issue arises when dealing with repeated keys in Form Data, as mentioned in the GitHub issue. The function currently processes repeated keys by taking only the last value, leading to incorrect behavior when the expected input should be a list, set, or tuple.

The bug occurs due to the logic inside the function that doesn't handle repeated keys as a list but instead takes only the last value for a given key. This behavior results in validation errors when trying to validate against a list, set, or tuple type.

## Bug Fix Strategy

To fix the bug and address the GitHub issue for supporting repeated key=value in form data, we need to modify the handling of field values in the function. Specifically, when dealing with repeated keys in Form Data, we should accumulate the values for each key as a list and then process them accordingly based on the field shape (list, set, tuple) during validation.

By updating the logic to correctly handle repeated keys in Form Data and ensure that the function processes them as expected for list-like types, we can resolve the current validation errors and provide the correct output for the failing tests.

## Corrected Version

Here is the corrected version of the `request_body_to_args` function:

```python
async def request_body_to_args(
    required_params: List[ModelField],
    received_body: Optional[Union[Dict[str, Any], FormData]],
) -> Tuple[Dict[str, Any], List[ErrorWrapper]]:
    values = {}
    errors = []

    if required_params:
        for field in required_params:
            values[field.name] = None
            if received_body is not None:
                if field.shape in sequence_shapes and isinstance(
                    received_body, FormData
                ):
                    values[field.name] = received_body.getlist(field.alias)
                else:
                    values[field.name] = received_body.get(field.alias)

            if values[field.name] is None or (
                isinstance(field_info, params.Form)
                and field.shape in sequence_shapes
                and len(values[field.name]) == 0
            ):
                if field.required:
                    if PYDANTIC_1:
                        errors.append(
                            ErrorWrapper(MissingError(), loc=("body", field.alias))
                        )
                    else:
                        errors.append(
                            ErrorWrapper(  # type: ignore
                                MissingError(),
                                loc=("body", field.alias),
                                config=BaseConfig,
                            )
                        )
                else:
                    values[field.name] = deepcopy(field.default)
                continue

            if (
                isinstance(field_info, params.File)
                and lenient_issubclass(field.type_, bytes)
                and isinstance(values[field.name], UploadFile)
            ):
                values[field.name] = await values[field.name].read()
            elif (
                field.shape in sequence_shapes
                and isinstance(field_info, params.File)
                and lenient_issubclass(field.type_, bytes)
                and isinstance(values[field.name], sequence_types)
            ):
                awaitables = [sub_value.read() for sub_value in values[field.name]]
                contents = await asyncio.gather(*awaitables)
                values[field.name] = sequence_shape_to_type[field.shape](contents)

            v_, errors_ = field.validate(values[field.name], values, loc=("body", field.alias))
            if isinstance(errors_, ErrorWrapper):
                errors.append(errors_)
            elif isinstance(errors_, list):
                errors.extend(errors_)
            else:
                values[field.name] = v_

    return values, errors
```

By updating the function in this way, it should now correctly handle repeated keys in the Form Data and process them as lists for the defined fields, resolving the validation issues and ensuring the correct behavior for the provided failing tests.
