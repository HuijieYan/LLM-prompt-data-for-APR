### Analysis
1. The error occurs when trying to check the length of `self.columns`, which is of type `NoneType`.
2. The `self.columns` parameter is expected to be a list of columns. Since it is `None`, the `len()` function results in a `TypeError`.
3. The bug causes the function to fail when trying to construct the `colnames` variable because it assumes `self.columns` is a list.
4. To fix the bug, we need to add a condition to handle the case where `self.columns` is `None` before trying to access its length.

### Bug Fix
Here is the corrected version of the `copy` function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:  # Check if self.columns is not None before getting its length
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

This fix adds a check for `self.columns` before attempting to access its length, preventing the `TypeError` when `self.columns` is `None`. Now, the function should handle the case where columns are not provided correctly.
