### Bug Analysis:
- The error message indicates a `TypeError` due to trying to get the length of `NoneType` object in the line `if len(self.columns) > 0`.
- The `DummyS3CopyToTableKey` instance is being initialized with `columns=None`, causing the bug when trying to access the length of `None`.
- The buggy function is assuming `self.columns` will always be a list, but in this case, it is being set to `None`.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
- Update the condition `if len(self.columns) > 0` to handle the case when `self.columns` is `None`.
- Add a check before accessing the length of `self.columns` to ensure it is not `None`.
- Provide a default behavior when `self.columns` is `None` in the copy operation.

### Corrected Version:
```python
    def copy(self, cursor, f):
        """
        Defines copying from s3 into redshift.
    
        If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
        """
        logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
        colnames = ''
        if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:
            colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
            colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)
    
        cursor.execute("""
         COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
         CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
         {options}
         ;""".format(
            table=self.table,
            colnames=colnames,
            source=f,
            creds=self._credentials(),
            options=self.copy_options)
        )
``` 

This corrected version includes a check for `self.columns` being `None` before trying to access its length. If `self.columns` is `None`, it will skip the column name logic and proceed with the copy operation.
