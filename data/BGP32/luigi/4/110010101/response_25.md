### Analysis
1. The buggy function `copy` is trying to check the length of `self.columns` to determine whether any columns are provided. However, if `self.columns` is `None`, it will raise a `TypeError` since `NoneType` does not have a length.
2. The error message specifies that the `TypeError` occurs at line 338 in the `copy` function where `len(self.columns)` is being used.
3. The expected behavior is that if `self.columns` is `None`, it should be handled gracefully without raising an exception.
4. To fix the bug, we can add a check to handle the case when `self.columns` is `None` before trying to get its length.

### Bug Fix
```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns is not None and len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

By adding the check `if self.columns is not None and len(self.columns) > 0`, we ensure that the code only tries to get the length of `self.columns` when it is not `None`. This prevents the `TypeError` from occurring when `self.columns` is `None`.
