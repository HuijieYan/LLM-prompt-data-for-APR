### Analysis
1. The error message indicates a `TypeError: object of type 'NoneType' has no len()` occurring at line 338, where the buggy function is attempting to access the length of `self.columns`, which is `None`.
2. The buggy function is not handling the case where `self.columns` is `None`, causing the TypeError to be raised.
3. The expected behavior is that if `self.columns` is `None`, the function should handle this case gracefully without attempting to access its length.
4. To fix the bug, we can add a check before trying to access the length of `self.columns`. If it is `None`, we can set `colnames` to an empty string.

### Corrected Function
```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    
    if self.columns is not None:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

By adding a check for `self.columns` being `None` before attempting to access its length, we ensure that the code does not lead to a TypeError.
