### Analysis
The error message indicates that the `TypeError: object of type 'NoneType' has no len()` is raised when trying to check the length of `self.columns`, which suggests that `self.columns` is `None` instead of a list. This points to a potential bug where the `columns` attribute is not properly initialized in the `DummyS3CopyToTableKey` class.

### Bug Cause
1. The `DummyS3CopyToTableKey` class does not properly initialize the `columns` attribute, making it `None`.
2. The buggy `copy` function does not handle the case when `self.columns` is `None`, leading to a `TypeError` when trying to check its length.

### Fixing the Bug
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the `columns` attribute is properly initialized in the `DummyS3CopyToTableKey` class. We can initialize it as an empty list if no value is provided during instantiation. Additionally, we should handle the case when `self.columns` is `None` in the `copy` function.

### Corrected Version
```python
class DummyS3CopyToTableKey:

    def __init__(self, table, columns=None):
        self.table = table
        self.columns = columns if columns is not None else []

    def copy(self, cursor, f):
        """
        Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

        If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
        """
        logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
        colnames = ''
        if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:
            colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
            colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

        cursor.execute("""
         COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
         CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
         {options}
         ;""".format(
            table=self.table,
            colnames=colnames,
            source=f,
            creds=self._credentials(),
            options=self.copy_options)
        )
```

By initializing `self.columns` with an empty list in the constructor and checking its existence before accessing its length in the `copy` function, we can prevent the `TypeError` and ensure the correct behavior of the function.
