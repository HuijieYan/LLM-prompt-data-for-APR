### Analysis
1. The error occurs because the `self.columns` attribute is `None`, which results in a `TypeError` when trying to check its length.
2. The `self.columns` attribute is set to `None` in the `DummyS3CopyToTableKey(columns=null)` call, causing the issue.
3. The function `copy` is trying to check the length of `self.columns` before constructing the `colnames` variable. This check throws a `TypeError` since `self.columns` is `None`. The expected behavior is to check if `self.columns` is not `None` before trying to extract column names.
4. To fix the bug, the `copy` function should check if `self.columns` is not `None` before constructing the `colnames` variable.

### Corrected Version
```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns is not None:  # Check if self.columns is not None
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

By adding the check `if self.columns is not None`, we ensure that the code only tries to extract column names if `self.columns` is not `None`, avoiding the `TypeError` when `self.columns` is `None`.
