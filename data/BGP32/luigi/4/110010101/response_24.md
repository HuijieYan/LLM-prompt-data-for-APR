### Analysis
1. The error message indicates a `TypeError` caused by trying to get the length of a `NoneType` object.
2. The code is trying to check the length of `self.columns`, which is `None`, leading to the error.
3. The `DummyS3CopyToTableKey` instance is passing `columns=None`, causing the issue when checking its length.
4. To fix the bug, we need to handle the case where `self.columns` is `None` before trying to get its length.
5. We can fix this by adding a condition to check if `self.columns` is not `None` before processing it.

### Bug Fix
```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns is not None:  # Add a null check for self.columns
        if len(self.columns) > 0:
            colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
            colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

By adding the check `if self.columns is not None`, we ensure that the length of `self.columns` is only checked when it is not `None`, preventing the `TypeError` mentioned in the error message. This fix allows the function to handle cases where `self.columns` is `None` gracefully.
