### Potential error locations within the buggy function
1. The if statement checking the length of `self.columns` could fail if `self.columns` is `None`.
2. The construction of `colnames` using `self.columns` without handling the case where it is `None` could lead to errors.

### Cause of the bug
The error occurs because the buggy function is trying to access the length of `self.columns`, which is `None`. This results in a `TypeError` as `NoneType` objects do not support the `len()` function.

### Strategy for fixing the bug
To fix the bug, we need to check if `self.columns` is `None` before trying to access its length. If `self.columns` is `None`, we should set `colnames` to an empty string to avoid the error.

### Corrected version of the buggy function
```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns is not None:  # Check if self.columns is not None
        if len(self.columns) > 0:
            colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
            colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

The corrected version includes a check for `self.columns` being `None` before trying to access its length. This check avoids the `TypeError` by ensuring that `colnames` is set to an empty string if `self.columns` is `None`.
