### Bug Analysis
The error message `TypeError: object of type 'NoneType' has no len()` indicates that the code is trying to call the `len()` function on a variable that is `None`. In this case, the error occurs when trying to access the `len(self.columns)` where `self.columns` is `None`.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix this bug, we need to check if `self.columns` is `None` before trying to calculate its length. If `self.columns` is `None`, we can set `colnames` to an empty string or handle the situation accordingly.

### Corrected Version of the Function
```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns is not None:  # Check if self.columns is not None
        if len(self.columns) > 0:
            colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
            colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

By adding the check `if self.columns is not None:` before trying to access the length of `self.columns`, we prevent the `TypeError` when `self.columns` is `None`. This corrected version should now handle the case where `self.columns` is `None` gracefully.
