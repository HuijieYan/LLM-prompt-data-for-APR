### Analysis
1. The buggy function is checking the length of `self.columns`, which is expected to be a list. However, if `self.columns` is `None`, the function will throw a `TypeError` since `None` does not have a `len()` method.
2. The error message indicates that the function is trying to call `len()` on an object of type `NoneType`.
3. To fix the bug, we need to handle the case where `self.columns` is `None` before attempting to get its length.

### Bug Fixing Strategy
1. Check if `self.columns` is `None` before trying to get its length.
2. If `self.columns` is not `None`, proceed with getting the length and constructing `colnames`.

### Corrected Version
```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns is not None:  # Check if self.columns is not None
        if len(self.columns) > 0:
            colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
            colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

By checking if `self.columns` is not `None` before attempting to get its length, we avoid the `TypeError` that occurs when `self.columns` is `None`.
