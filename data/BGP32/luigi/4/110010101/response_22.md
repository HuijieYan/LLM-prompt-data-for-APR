## Analysis
1. The buggy function `copy` is called within the `run` method of the `S3CopyToTable` class.
2. The error occurs when trying to check the length of `self.columns`, which is a `NoneType`.
3. The error message indicates that `TypeError: object of type 'NoneType' has no len()`.
4. The expected behavior is to handle the case where `self.columns` is `None`.

## Bug Cause
The buggy function does not account for the scenario where `self.columns` is `None`. Attempting to check the length of `self.columns` directly results in a `TypeError`.

## Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to check whether `self.columns` is `None` before trying to get its length. If `self.columns` is `None`, we should handle it appropriately to prevent the `TypeError`.

## Corrected Version
```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns is not None:  # Check if self.columns is not None
        if len(self.columns) > 0:
            colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
            colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

By adding the condition `if self.columns is not None:` before checking the length of `self.columns`, we avoid the `TypeError` when `self.columns` is `None`. This corrected version should now handle the case where `self.columns` is `None` smoothly.
