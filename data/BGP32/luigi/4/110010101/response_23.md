### Analysis:
1. The error message indicates a `TypeError: object of type 'NoneType' has no len()` at line 338.
2. The buggy function `copy` checks the length of `self.columns` without handling the case where `self.columns` is `None`.
3. The `self.columns` attribute is passed as `None` in the failing test case, causing the error because `None` type does not have a length.
4. To fix the bug, we need to check if `self.columns` is `None` before checking its length to avoid the `TypeError`.
5. We should handle the case where `self.columns` is `None` in the `copy` function.

### Fixing the Bug:
Here's a corrected version of the `copy` function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    
    if self.columns is not None:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

With this fix, the code will first check if `self.columns` is not `None` before trying to access its length. This will prevent the `TypeError` from occurring.
