### Explanation:
The error occurs because the `columns` attribute of the `self` object is `None`, leading to a `TypeError` when trying to call `len()` on it. The code does not handle the case where `self.columns` is `None`.

### Strategy for fixing the bug:
We need to check if `self.columns` is `None` before trying to get its length. If it is `None`, we can set `colnames` to an empty string directly.

### The corrected version of the function:
```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    
    if self.columns is None:
        colnames = ''
    else:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```
