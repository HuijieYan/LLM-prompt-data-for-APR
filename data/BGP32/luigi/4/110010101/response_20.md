The issue in the provided buggy function is that it tries to check the length of `self.columns`, which is `None` in this specific case where `columns` is provided as `None` to `DummyS3CopyToTableKey`. This leads to a TypeError because `NoneType` objects do not have a `len()` method.

To fix this bug, we should first check if `self.columns` is not `None` before trying to get its length. If `self.columns` is `None`, we can set `colnames` to an empty string directly.

Here is the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    
    if self.columns is not None:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

With this correction, the `copy` function will correctly handle the case when `self.columns` is `None` and set `colnames` to an empty string in that scenario.

This corrected version should pass the failing test case provided.
