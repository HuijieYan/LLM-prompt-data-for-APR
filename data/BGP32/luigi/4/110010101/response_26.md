### Analysis:
- The error message indicates that the `self.columns` attribute is of type `NoneType`, leading to a `TypeError` when trying to get the length of `None`.
- The `copy` function is assuming that `self.columns` will always be a list, which is not always the case. This assumption is causing the bug.
- To fix the bug, we need to handle the case where `self.columns` is `None` before attempting to get its length.

### Strategy for fixing the bug:
1. Check if `self.columns` is not `None` before trying to access its length. If it is `None`, set `colnames` to an empty string.
2. Update the variable `colnames` using a ternary condition to handle the case where `self.columns` is `None`.

### Corrected version of the `copy` function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    
    colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns]) if self.columns is not None else ''
    colnames = '({})'.format(colnames) if colnames else ''

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
``` 

This corrected version of the `copy` function handles the case where `self.columns` is `None` by setting `colnames` to an empty string before trying to access its length. This fix should resolve the `TypeError` that occurred due to the bug.
