The bug in the provided `copy` function arises from the attempt to check the length of `self.columns` without verifying whether it is `None`. This leads to a `TypeError` when trying to apply `len` on a `NoneType` object.

To fix this bug, we need to first check if `self.columns` is `None` before proceeding to get its length. If it is `None`, we can handle this case appropriately (e.g., set `colnames` to an empty string).

Here is the corrected version of the `copy` function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns is not None and len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

This corrected version checks if `self.columns` is not `None` before attempting to get its length, thus preventing the `TypeError` encountered in the buggy function.
