### Analysis
1. The buggy function `copy` is intended to copy data from S3 to Redshift using the provided parameters such as table, columns, source, credentials, and copy options.
2. The error occurs when the function tries to check the length of `self.columns`, which is `None`.
3. The error message indicates that the TypeError is raised because the object `NoneType` (representing the `self.columns` attribute) has no length.
4. To fix the bug, we need to handle the case where `self.columns` is `None` before attempting to get its length.

### Bug Fixing Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to add a check before trying to get the length of `self.columns`. If `self.columns` is `None`, we can set `colnames` to an empty string without attempting to join any column names.

### Corrected Version
```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns is not None:  # Check if columns is not None
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

With this modification, the corrected function will now handle the case where `self.columns` is `None` and set `colnames` to an empty string, preventing the TypeError.
