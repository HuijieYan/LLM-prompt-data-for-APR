The issue in the provided buggy function is that it is not handling the `self.columns` attribute being `None` correctly. When `self.columns` is `None`, the `TypeError: object of type 'NoneType' has no len()` occurs when trying to check the length of `self.columns`.

To fix this bug, we need to add a condition to first check if `self.columns` is not `None` before proceeding to attempt to get the length of `self.columns`.

Here is the corrected version of the function:
```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns is not None:
        if len(self.columns) > 0:
            colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
            colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

This corrected version will first check if `self.columns` is not `None` before trying to get its length and proceed accordingly.

By implementing this fix, the function should now pass the failing test case provided.
