### Analysis
1. The error message indicates a `TypeError` caused by trying to get the length of `self.columns` when it is `None`. This suggests that `self.columns` is not properly handled for a `None` value.
2. The `copy` function is trying to build a string `colnames` from `self.columns`, but it does not have proper handling for the case when `self.columns` is `None`.
3. The buggy function is failing to handle the case when `self.columns` is `None`, leading to a `TypeError` when trying to get the length of `None`.
4. To fix the bug, we need to add a check for `None` in `self.columns` and handle it properly in the `copy` function.

### Fixing the Bug
To fix the bug, we will add a check for `None` in `self.columns` before trying to get the length. If `self.columns` is `None`, we will set `colnames` to an empty string. 

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    
    if self.columns is None:
        colnames = ''
    else:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

This fix will handle the case when `self.columns` is `None` and prevent the `TypeError` by setting `colnames` to an empty string in that case.
