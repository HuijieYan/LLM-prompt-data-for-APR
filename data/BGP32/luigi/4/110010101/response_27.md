### Buggy Function Analysis
The buggy function `copy` in the `S3CopyToTable` class is failing due to a `TypeError` when checking the length of `self.columns`. The error occurs because `self.columns` is `None` and the function is trying to call `len()` on a `NoneType` object. This error is causing the test case to fail.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix this bug, we need to handle the case where `self.columns` is `None` gracefully in the `copy` function. We can check if `self.columns` is `None` before trying to get its length.

### Corrected Version
Here is the corrected version of the `copy` function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns is not None:
        if len(self.columns) > 0:
            colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
            colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

In this corrected version, we added a check to ensure that if `self.columns` is `None`, the code inside the `if` block is not executed. This will prevent the `TypeError` and the function will handle `None` values in `self.columns` gracefully.
