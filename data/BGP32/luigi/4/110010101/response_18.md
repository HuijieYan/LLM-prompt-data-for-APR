### Cause of the bug:
The error occurs because the `self.columns` attribute is set to `None`, and the buggy function is trying to check the length of `self.columns` without considering the case when it is `None`. This results in a `TypeError` since `NoneType` object does not have the `len()` method.

### Strategy for fixing the bug:
To fix the bug, we need to handle the case when `self.columns` is `None` properly before checking its length. We can modify the condition to first check if `self.columns` is not `None`, and then proceed with checking its length.

### Corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
    def copy(self, cursor, f):
        """
        Defines copying from s3 into redshift.
    
        If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
        """
        logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
        colnames = ''
        if self.columns is not None and len(self.columns) > 0:
            colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
            colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)
    
        cursor.execute("""
         COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
         CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
         {options}
         ;""".format(
            table=self.table,
            colnames=colnames,
            source=f,
            creds=self._credentials(),
            options=self.copy_options)
        )
``` 

By checking if `self.columns` is not `None` before trying to access its length, we ensure that the code does not throw a `TypeError` in case `self.columns` is `None`.
