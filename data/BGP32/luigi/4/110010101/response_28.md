### Analysis
1. The error occurs in the condition `if len(self.columns) > 0`. The error message indicates that `self.columns` is of type `NoneType`, hence causing the `TypeError`.
2. The function is attempting to get the length of `self.columns` without checking if it is `None`.
3. The `columns` attribute should be properly handled to avoid this error. It seems that the `columns` attribute is expected to be a list, but it is given as `None`.
4. To fix this bug, we should add a check to see if `self.columns` is `None` before attempting to get its length.

### Correction
```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns is not None and len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

By adding the check `if self.columns is not None and len(self.columns) > 0`, we ensure that the function only proceeds to get the length of `self.columns` if it is not `None`, thereby preventing the `TypeError` caused by attempting to get the length of a `NoneType` object.
