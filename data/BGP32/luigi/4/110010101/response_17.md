The bug in the provided function is caused by trying to check the length of a `NoneType` object (`self.columns`). This error occurs when `self.columns` is `None`, and the function tries to perform the `len()` operation on it.

To fix this bug, we need to handle the case where `self.columns` is `None` before trying to calculate the length. One way to do this is to first check if `self.columns` is `None` before proceeding with the length calculation.

Here is the corrected version of the `copy` function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns is not None:  # Check if self.columns is not None before computing length
        if len(self.columns) > 0:
            colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
            colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

By adding the check `if self.columns is not None:` before checking the length, we ensure that the code will only attempt to calculate the length of `self.columns` if it is not `None`. This modification should fix the bug and prevent the `TypeError` from occurring when `self.columns` is `None`.
