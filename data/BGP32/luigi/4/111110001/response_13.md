### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `copy` in the `S3CopyToTable` class is supposed to copy data from S3 to Redshift.
2. The test case checks if calling the `run` method of `DummyS3CopyToTableKey` results in the correct `COPY` SQL query being executed.
3. The error is a `TypeError` caused by trying to get the length of `self.columns`, which is `None` in this case.
4. To fix the bug, we need to handle the case where `self.columns` is `None` before trying to access its length.

### Strategy for fixing the bug:
Since we are dealing with checking if `self.columns` is `None` before accessing its length, we can modify the code to handle this case.

### Corrected Version:
```python
class S3CopyToTable(rdbms.CopyToTable, _CredentialsMixin):
    ...

    def copy(self, cursor, f):
        """
        Defines copying from s3 into redshift.
    
        If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
        """
        logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
        colnames = ''
        if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:
            colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
            colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)
    
        cursor.execute("""
         COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
         CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
         {options}
         ;""".format(
            table=self.table,
            colnames=colnames,
            source=f,
            creds=self._credentials(),
            options=self.copy_options())
        )
```

By adding a check for `self.columns` before accessing its length, we prevent the `TypeError` when `self.columns` is `None`. This corrected version of the `copy` function should now pass the failing test.
