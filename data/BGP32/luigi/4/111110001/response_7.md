### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `copy` from the `S3CopyToTable` class is trying to check the length of the `columns` attribute (which is `None`) and encountering a `TypeError` when trying to call `len()` on `None`.
2. The test case `test_s3_copy_with_nonetype_columns` is setting `columns` to `None` in the `DummyS3CopyToTableKey` instance, which is causing the `self.columns` in the `copy` function to be `None`.
3. The buggy function is trying to perform an operation based on the assumption that `self.columns` will be a list, but since it's `None`, this assumption fails, leading to a `TypeError`.
4. To fix the bug, we need to handle the case where `self.columns` is `None` before trying to check its length.

### Suggested Fix:
```python
    def copy(self, cursor, f):
        """
        Defines copying from s3 into redshift.
    
        If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
        """
        logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
        colnames = ''
        if self.columns is not None and len(self.columns) > 0:  # Check if self.columns is not None
            colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
            colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)
    
        cursor.execute("""
         COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
         CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
         {options}
         ;""".format(
            table=self.table,
            colnames=colnames,
            source=f,
            creds=self._credentials(),
            options=self.copy_options())
        )
```

### Corrected Version:
```python
    def copy(self, cursor, f):
        """
        Defines copying from s3 into redshift.
    
        If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
        """
        logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
        colnames = ''
        if self.columns is not None and len(self.columns) > 0:  # Check if self.columns is not None
            colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
            colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)
    
        cursor.execute("""
         COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
         CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
         {options}
         ;""".format(
            table=self.table,
            colnames=colnames,
            source=f,
            creds=self._credentials(),
            options=self.copy_options())
        )
``` 

By checking if `self.columns` is not `None` before trying to access its length, we can prevent the `TypeError` and ensure that the corrected function works as expected.
