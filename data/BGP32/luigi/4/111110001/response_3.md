### Analysis:
1. The `copy` function in the `S3CopyToTable` class from the `luigi/contrib/redshift.py` file is attempting to check the length of the `columns` attribute, which is None in the failing test.
2. The error message indicates a TypeError due to attempting to get the length of a `NoneType` object.
3. The `columns` attribute being `None` in the `DummyS3CopyToTableKey` instance leads to the `len(self.columns)` check failing in the `copy` function.
4. To fix the bug, we need to add a check for `None` before trying to get the length of the `columns` attribute.

### Bug Fix:
Here is the corrected version of the `copy` function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns is not None and len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} FROM '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options())
    )
```

In the corrected version, I added `if self.columns is not None` before checking the length of the `columns` attribute to avoid the TypeError when `columns` is None. Additionally, I corrected `'{source}'` in the SQL query to properly surround it with single quotes.

By making these changes, the corrected `copy` function should now pass the failing test.
