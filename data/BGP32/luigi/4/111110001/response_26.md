### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `copy` in the `S3CopyToTable` class is attempting to check the length of `self.columns`, which results in a `TypeError` because `self.columns` is None.
2. The error occurs when the `copy` function is trying to construct the SQL statement to copy data from S3 to Redshift.
3. The failing test is trying to run the `DummyS3CopyToTableKey` task with columns set to None, triggering the `TypeError`.
4. To fix this, we need to handle the case where `self.columns` is None before trying to get its length in the `copy` function.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
- Check if `self.columns` is None before trying to extract its length and only construct the column names if it's not None.
- Provide a default value or handle the case where `self.columns` is None to prevent the `TypeError`.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns is not None and len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

By checking if `self.columns` is not None before trying to access its length, we prevent the `TypeError` that was occurring when `self.columns` was None. This corrected version should now handle the case where `self.columns` is None and pass the failing test successfully.
