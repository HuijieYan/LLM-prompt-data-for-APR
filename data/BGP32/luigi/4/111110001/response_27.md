### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `copy` in the `S3CopyToTable` class is attempting to access the `columns` attribute of the instance (`self`) without handling the case where `columns` could be `None`.
2. The failing test `test_s3_copy_with_nonetype_columns` creates an instance of `DummyS3CopyToTableKey` with `columns` as `None`.
3. When the `copy` function is called in the test, it tries to call `len(self.columns)`, resulting in a `TypeError` due to trying to get the length of a `NoneType` object.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix this bug, we need to check if `self.columns` is `None` before trying to access its length. If it is `None`, we can set `colnames = ''` directly.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns is not None and len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options())
    )
```

By making this change, we first check if `self.columns` is not `None` before trying to get its length. This fix will prevent the `TypeError` when `columns` is `None`, allowing the function to execute correctly.
