## Analysis:
1. The buggy function `copy` in the `S3CopyToTable` class is trying to access the length of `self.columns`, which leads to a `TypeError` when `self.columns` is `None`. 
2. The error occurs because `self.columns` is not properly handled for being `None`.
3. The failing test `test_s3_copy_with_nonetype_columns` provides a mocked `DummyS3CopyToTableKey` object with `columns=None`, triggering the bug in the `copy` function.
4. To fix the bug, we should check if `self.columns` is not `None` before trying to access its length. If `self.columns` is `None`, we should handle it appropriately.
5. The corrected version is provided below:

## Corrected Version:
```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

By adding `if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:` we check if `self.columns` is not `None` before attempting to access its length, thus fixing the bug that caused the `TypeError`.
