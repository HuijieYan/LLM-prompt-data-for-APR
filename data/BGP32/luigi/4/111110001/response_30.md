### Analysis:
1. The buggy function is the `copy` method within the `S3CopyToTable` class in the `luigi/contrib/redshift.py` file. This function is responsible for defining the copy operation from s3 to Redshift.
2. The error occurs when trying to check the length of `self.columns`, which causes a `TypeError: object of type 'NoneType' has no len()`.
3. The failing test `test_s3_copy_with_nonetype_columns` calls the `run` method of `DummyS3CopyToTableKey` which in turn calls the `copy` method. The error message clearly indicates that the code is trying to get the length of `self.columns`, but `columns` is set to `None` in this particular test. This causes the `TypeError`.
4. To fix the bug, we need to handle the scenario where `self.columns` is `None` before trying to access its length. We can set `colnames` to an empty string in case `self.columns` is `None`.
5. Below is the corrected version of the `copy` method with a fix to handle the `None` case:

### Corrected Version:
```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options())
    )
```

With this corrected version, the code will check if `self.columns` is not `None` before trying to access its length. If `self.columns` is `None`, it will set `colnames` to an empty string. This will prevent the `TypeError` that was occurring in the buggy code.
