### Bug Analysis:
1. The buggy function `copy` in the `S3CopyToTable` class is trying to access the `columns` attribute without checking if it is `None`, which causes a `TypeError` since it is trying to get the length of a `NoneType` object.
2. The failing test `test_s3_copy_with_nonetype_columns` creates an instance of `DummyS3CopyToTableKey` with `columns=None`, which triggers the bug in the `copy` function when it tries to check the length of `columns`.
3. The error message clearly shows that the bug is caused by trying to get the length of a `NoneType` object. The failing test fails at the line `task.run()` and the error occurs when trying to access `len(self.columns)`.
4. To fix the bug, we need to check if `self.columns` is `None` before trying to access its length. If it is `None`, we can set an appropriate default value for `colnames` instead of formatting it directly.

### Bug Fix:
Here is the corrected version of the `copy` function in the `S3CopyToTable` class:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    
    if self.columns is None:
        colnames = ''
    else:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

With this fix, the `copy` function will first check if `self.columns` is `None`. If it is `None`, it will set `colnames` to an empty string, preventing the `TypeError` when trying to access the length of `NoneType` object.
