### Analysis:
1. The buggy function in question is `copy` defined within the `S3CopyToTable` class in `luigi/contrib/redshift.py`. This function is supposed to copy data from S3 into Redshift.
2. The error message indicates that a `TypeError` is raised because `self.columns` is of type `NoneType` and the code tries to call `len()` on it.
3. The failing test `test_s3_copy_with_nonetype_columns` creates an instance of `DummyS3CopyToTableKey` with `columns=None`. During the execution, the `columns` attribute being `None` causes the `TypeError` in the `copy` function.
4. To fix the bug, we need to handle the case where `self.columns` is `None` in the `copy` function.
5. The corrected version of the function is provided below:

### Corrected Version:
```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns is not None and len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)
    
    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options())
    )
```

In the corrected version, we check if `self.columns` is not `None` before trying to get its length. This will prevent the `TypeError` when `self.columns` is `None`.
