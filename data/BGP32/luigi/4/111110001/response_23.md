### Analysis:
1. The `copy` function defined in the `S3CopyToTable` class is attempting to access the length of `self.columns`, which raises a `TypeError` when `self.columns` is `None`.
2. The `copy` function is expecting `self.columns` to be a list of columns, but in the failing test, it is assigned `None`, leading to the issue.
3. The failing test is calling the `run` method of the `DummyS3CopyToTableKey` task, which triggers the `copy` method. Inside the `copy` method, the length of `self.columns` is checked, causing the `TypeError` due to `NoneType`.
4. To fix the bug, we need to add a condition to handle the case where `self.columns` is `None` in the `copy` method before trying to access its length.
5. The error can be resolved by checking if `self.columns` is not `None` before attempting to get its length.
6. The corrected version of the `copy` function is provided below:

### Corrected Version:
```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

By adding the condition `if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0`, we ensure that the code inside the block is executed only when `self.columns` is not `None`, preventing the `TypeError` that occurred in the failing test.
