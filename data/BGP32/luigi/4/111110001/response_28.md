### Analysis:
1. The `copy` function within the `S3CopyToTable` class in `luigi/contrib/redshift.py` is attempting to access the length of `self.columns`, which raises a `TypeError` due to `self.columns` being assigned a `None` value.
2. The test `test_s3_copy_with_nonetype_columns` in `test/contrib/redshift_test.py` sets the `columns` attribute of `DummyS3CopyToTableKey` task to `None`, triggering the bug.
3. The failing test provides an error message stating that a `TypeError` occurred at line 338 of `luigi/contrib/redshift.py` due to attempting to get the length of a `NoneType` object.
4. To fix the bug, we should ensure that the `columns` attribute is not `None` before attempting to access its length.

### Fix:
```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns is not None and len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options())
    )
```

By checking if `self.columns` is not `None` before accessing its length, we prevent the `TypeError` that was occurring. This correction ensures that the `copy` function behaves correctly even when `columns` is not provided.
