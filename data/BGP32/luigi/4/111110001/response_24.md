### Analysis:
1. The buggy function is the `copy` method inside the `S3CopyToTable` class in the `luigi/contrib/redshift.py` file.
2. The test function is trying to run a task (`DummyS3CopyToTableKey`) that has `columns` set to `None`, which causes a `TypeError` during execution of the `copy` method as it tries to check the length of `self.columns`.
3. The `copy` method should be able to handle cases where `self.columns` is `None` without causing a `TypeError`.
4. The bug can be fixed by checking if `self.columns` is not `None` before trying to get its length.
5. The corrected version of the `copy` method should include a check for `None` before trying to get the length of `self.columns`.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns is not None and len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

By adding the check `if self.columns is not None` before checking the length, the corrected version of the `copy` method should now be able to handle cases where `self.columns` is `None` without raising a `TypeError`.
