### Analysis:
1. The class `S3CopyToTable` from `luigi.contrib.redshift` contains a method `copy` that is supposed to copy data from S3 to Redshift using credentials provided. 
2. The error message indicates a `TypeError` caused by trying to get the length of a `NoneType` object in the `copy` method.
3. The failing test `test_s3_copy_with_nonetype_columns` creates an instance of `DummyS3CopyToTableKey` with `columns=None` and tries to run the task. The `copy` method in the task tries to check the length of `self.columns`, but since it is being passed as `None`, it results in the `TypeError`.
4. To fix the bug, we need to handle the scenario where `self.columns` could be `None` before trying to access its length.
5. We should modify the `copy` method to check if `self.columns` is `None` before attempting to get its length and generate the corresponding `colnames`.

### Suggestions to fix the bug:
To fix the bug in the `copy` method, we need to ensure that the `self.columns` attribute is checked for `None` before proceeding to generate the `colnames`. If `self.columns` is `None`, `colnames` should also be `None`.

### Corrected version of the `copy` method:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns is not None:
        if len(self.columns) > 0:
            colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
            colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)
    
    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options())
    )
```

### Explanation:
In the corrected version, we first check if `self.columns` is not `None` before trying to access its length for generating `colnames`. This change ensures that if `self.columns` is `None`, `colnames` will also be set to an empty string, avoiding the `TypeError`.
