### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `copy` in the `S3CopyToTable` class of the `luigi.contrib.redshift` module is attempting to check the length of `self.columns`, which is causing an issue because when `columns=None` is passed to the task, it results in a `NoneType` object.
   
### Potential Error Locations:
- The condition `if len(self.columns) > 0` is not handling the case where `self.columns` is `None`.

### Cause of the Bug:
- The bug is caused by the comparison `if len(self.columns) > 0` where `self.columns` is `None`, resulting in a `TypeError`.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
- To fix this bug, we need to handle the case where `self.columns` is `None` separately before trying to access its length.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns is not None and len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options())
    )
```

### Explanation:
- In the corrected version, we first check if `self.columns` is not `None` before checking its length to avoid the `TypeError`.
- Additionally, the `copy_options` method is called correctly by using `self.copy_options()` instead of just `self.copy_options`.

With this correction, the bug related to `NoneType` object has no length will be fixed, and the test case will pass successfully.
