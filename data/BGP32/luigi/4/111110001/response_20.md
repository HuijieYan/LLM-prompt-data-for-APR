### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `copy` in the `S3CopyToTable` class is expecting the `columns` attribute to be a list, but in the failing test, it is passed as `None`.
2. The buggy function tries to construct the `colnames` string by joining the columns, but since `columns` is `None`, it results in a `TypeError`.
3. The failing test `test_s3_copy_with_nonetype_columns` tries to run a task that has `columns` attribute set to `None`, resulting in a TypeError when the `copy` function of the task is executed. The error message clearly points out that a `NoneType` object has no length.
4. To fix the bug, we need to handle the case where `columns` is `None` and set `colnames` accordingly to avoid the `TypeError`.

### Bug fix strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to check if `self.columns` is `None` before trying to construct the `colnames` string. If it is `None`, we can set `colnames` to an empty string. This will handle the case where `columns` is not provided, preventing the `TypeError`.

### Corrected Version:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    
    if self.columns:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

By checking if `self.columns` is `None` before trying to process it, we ensure that the `colnames` are built correctly without causing a `TypeError`. Now the function should be able to handle cases where `columns` is `None` and should pass the failing test.
