### Analysis:
1. The `copy` function in the `S3CopyToTable` class is expecting a list of columns (`self.columns`) to be provided, but in the failing test, it is passed as `None`.
2. The code tries to calculate the length of `self.columns`, which results in a `TypeError` because `NoneType` does not have a length.
3. The error message indicates that the `TypeError` is raised in the `if len(self.columns) > 0:` statement because `self.columns` is `None`.
4. To fix the issue, we need to handle the case where `self.columns` is `None` before trying to calculate its length.

### Fixed Version:
```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info(f"Inserting file: {f}")
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:  # Handle the case when self.columns is None
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options())
    )
```

In the corrected version, I added a check `if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:` to verify if `self.columns` is not `None` before attempting to calculate its length. This change ensures that the code does not try to access the length of `None`, fixing the `TypeError` issue.
