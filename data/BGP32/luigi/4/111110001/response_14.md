### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `copy` in the `S3CopyToTable` class is trying to check the length of `self.columns`, but it fails with a `TypeError: object of type 'NoneType' has no len()` because `columns` is `None`.
2. The `copy` function is constructing a SQL query string to perform a `COPY` operation in Redshift, and it includes the `self.columns` in the query, which is causing the bug.
3. The failing test is trying to instantiate a task `DummyS3CopyToTableKey` with `columns=None` and then run the task, which leads to the `copy` function being called with `columns` set to `None`, causing the error. The error message clearly indicates that `NoneType` has no length.
4. To fix the bug, we need to handle the case where `self.columns` is `None` in the `copy` function and have appropriate logic to deal with it without causing a `TypeError`.
5. We can modify the `copy` function to check if `self.columns` is `None` before trying to get its length. If it's `None`, we can set `colnames` to an empty string directly.

### Corrected Version:
```python
    def copy(self, cursor, f):
        """
        Defines copying from s3 into redshift.
    
        If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
        """
        logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
        
        if self.columns is None:
            colnames = ''
        else:
            colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
            colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)
    
        cursor.execute("""
         COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
         CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
         {options}
         ;""".format(
            table=self.table,
            colnames=colnames,
            source=f,
            creds=self._credentials(),
            options=self.copy_options)
        )
```

By checking if `self.columns` is `None` before trying to manipulate it, we ensure that `colnames` is correctly set to an empty string when `columns` is `None`. This correction should fix the bug and make the `copy` function work as intended.
