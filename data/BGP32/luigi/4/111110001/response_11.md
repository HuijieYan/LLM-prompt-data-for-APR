### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `copy` in the `S3CopyToTable` class is attempting to check the length of `self.columns`. However, when the `columns` attribute is set to `None`, the code throws a `TypeError` when trying to apply `len()` on a `NoneType` object.
2. The failing test `test_s3_copy_with_nonetype_columns` creates an instance of `DummyS3CopyToTableKey` with `columns` set to `None` and then calls the `run` method on the task.
3. The failing test's error message clearly indicates that the issue is with trying to apply `len()` on a `NoneType` object.
4. To fix this bug, we should check if `self.columns` is not `None` before trying to access its length.

### Strategy for fixing the bug:
Add a condition to check if `self.columns` is not `None` before calculating its length.

### Corrected Version:
```python
# The declaration of the class containing the buggy function
class S3CopyToTable(rdbms.CopyToTable, _CredentialsMixin):
    """
    Template task for inserting a data set into Redshift from s3.
    
    Usage:
    
    * Subclass and override the required attributes:
    
      * `host`,
      * `database`,
      * `user`,
      * `password`,
      * `table`,
      * `columns`,
      * `s3_load_path`.
    
    * You can also override the attributes provided by the
      CredentialsMixin if they are not supplied by your
      configuration or environment variables.
    """


    # This function from the same class is called by the buggy function
    def copy_options(self):
        # Please ignore the body of this function



    # Updated and corrected copy function
    def copy(self, cursor, f):
        """
        Defines copying from s3 into redshift.
    
        If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
        """
        logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
        colnames = ''
        if self.columns is not None and len(self.columns) > 0:
            colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
            colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)
    
        cursor.execute("""
         COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
         CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
         {options}
         ;""".format(
            table=self.table,
            colnames=colnames,
            source=f,
            creds=self._credentials(),
            options=self.copy_options)
        )
```

By adding the condition `if self.columns is not None and len(self.columns) > 0`, we ensure that the code will only try to calculate the length of `self.columns` if it is not `None`. This will prevent the `TypeError` and the function will run successfully.
