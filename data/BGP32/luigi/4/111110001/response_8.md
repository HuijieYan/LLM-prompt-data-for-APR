### Analysis:
1. The `S3CopyToTable` class has a `copy` function that is responsible for copying data from s3 to Redshift.
2. The failing test `test_s3_copy_with_nonetype_columns` initializes a task `DummyS3CopyToTableKey` with `columns=None` which triggers a bug in the `copy` function.
3. The bug is triggered because the code tries to check the length of `self.columns` (which is `None` in this case) before attempting to create the `colnames` string.
4. The bug can be fixed by checking if `self.columns` is `None` instead of directly checking for its length.
5. The `copy` function needs to handle the case where `self.columns` is `None` properly.

### Bug Fix:
```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns is not None:  # Check if self.columns is not None
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

By adding a check for `self.columns` not being `None`, the bug where a `NoneType` object was being used in a context where it expected a sequence has been fixed. This corrected version of the `copy` function will now properly handle the case where `self.columns` is `None` and avoid the `TypeError`.
