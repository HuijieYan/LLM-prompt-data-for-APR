### Analysis:
1. The provided buggy function is the `copy` method within the `S3CopyToTable` class in the `luigi/contrib/redshift.py` file. This class is a template task for inserting a data set into Redshift from S3.
2. The main error in the `copy` method occurs when attempting to check the length of `self.columns`. If `self.columns` is `None`, which is a valid input, the function will throw a `TypeError` because `NoneType` does not support the `len()` function.
3. The failing test `test_s3_copy_with_nonetype_columns` is mocking the behavior and involves testing the `DummyS3CopyToTableKey` class, which passes `columns=None` to the `S3CopyToTable` instance. When the `task.run()` is called, it executes the `copy` method, leading to the `TypeError` due to trying to get the length of a `NoneType`.
4. To fix the bug, we need to check if `self.columns` is `None` before trying to access its length. If it is `None`, we should handle this case appropriately.
5. The corrected version of the `copy` method is as follows:

### Corrected Version:
```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided,
    role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns is not None and len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options())
    )
```

### Explanation:
The corrected version checks if `self.columns` is not `None` before trying to access its length. If `self.columns` is `None`, it does not try to get its length, avoiding the `TypeError` encountered in the failing test. This change ensures that the code handles the case where `columns` is `None` appropriately, fixing the bug.
