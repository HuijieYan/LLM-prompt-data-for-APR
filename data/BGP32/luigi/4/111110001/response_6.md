### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `copy()` within the `S3CopyToTable` class is attempting to retrieve the length of `self.columns`, which is expected to be a list, but when `columns=None` is passed during the test, it results in a `TypeError` as a `NoneType` object does not have a length.

### Bug Cause:
The bug occurs because the `copy()` function does not handle the case where `self.columns` is `None`, leading to the `TypeError`.

### Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to add a check to handle the case when `self.columns` is `None`. We can initialize `colnames` to an empty string if `self.columns` is `None`.
 
### Corrected Version:
```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    if self.columns is not None:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)
    else:
        colnames = ''
    
    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options())
    )
```

By making this change, the corrected function will handle the case when `self.columns` is `None` and prevent the `TypeError` encountered in the failing test.
