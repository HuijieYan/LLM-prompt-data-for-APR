### Analysis:
1. The buggy function is within the `S3CopyToTable` class in the `luigi/contrib/redshift.py` file. The function `copy` is responsible for executing a `COPY` command to load data from S3 into Redshift.
2. The failing test `test_s3_copy_with_nonetype_columns` provides the `DummyS3CopyToTableKey` task with `columns=None`, triggering the bug in the `copy` function due to handling of `None` type.
3. The error message indicates a `TypeError` due to trying to get the length of `None` type within the `copy` function when checking `if len(self.columns) > 0`.
4. To fix the bug, we need to handle the case where `self.columns` is `None` before trying to get its length.
5. The corrected version of the `copy` function should handle the case where `self.columns` is `None`.

### Fix and Corrected Version:
Here's the corrected version of the `copy` function to handle the `None` case:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from S3 into Redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns is not None and len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options())
    )
```

By adding the `if self.columns is not None and` condition before checking the length, the corrected function will handle the `None` case and prevent the `TypeError`.
