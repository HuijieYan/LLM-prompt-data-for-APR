### Analysis:
1. The buggy function is the `copy` method within the `S3CopyToTable` class in `luigi.contrib.redshift.py`.
2. The buggy function is trying to check the length of `self.columns`, but the issue arises because `self.columns` is `None`.
3. The failing test (`test_s3_copy_with_nonetype_columns`) is attempting to run a task (`DummyS3CopyToTableKey`) with `columns` set to `None`, resulting in the error when the `copy` method of the task is called.
4. To fix the bug, we need to handle the case where `self.columns` is `None` in the `copy` method.
5. Here is the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

With this correction, the `copy` method will first check if `self.columns` is not None before trying to access its length. If `self.columns` is `None`, it will skip the operation that causes the error.
