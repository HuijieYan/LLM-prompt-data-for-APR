### Analysis:
1. The buggy function is the `copy` method inside the `S3CopyToTable` class from the `luigi/contrib/redshift.py` file. 
2. The failing test `test_s3_copy_with_nonetype_columns` is trying to test the behavior of the `S3CopyToTable` class when the `columns` attribute is `None`.
3. The error occurs because the buggy function is trying to check the length of the `columns` attribute which is `None`, resulting in a `TypeError`.
4. A strategy to fix this bug would be to first check if the `columns` attribute is not `None` before trying to access its length.

### Bug Fix:
Here is the corrected version of the `copy` method:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options())
    )
```

By adding the `if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:` check before accessing the length of `self.columns`, we ensure that the code does not throw a `TypeError` when `self.columns` is `None`.

This fix should resolve the issue and make the test case `test_s3_copy_with_nonetype_columns` pass successfully.
