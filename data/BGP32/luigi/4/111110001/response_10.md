### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `copy` from the `S3CopyToTable` class is trying to check the length of `self.columns` without handling the case when `self.columns` is `None`.
2. The failing test `test_s3_copy_with_nonetype_columns` creates an instance of `DummyS3CopyToTableKey` with `columns` set to `None`, which triggers the error when `self.columns` is checked for length in the `copy` function.
3. The error message indicates a `TypeError` due to trying to get the length of a `NoneType` object, which occurs in the buggy line `if len(self.columns) > 0:`.
4. To fix the bug, we need to handle the case when `self.columns` is `None` before trying to get its length.
5. The bug can be fixed by explicitly checking if `self.columns` is `None` before attempting to get its length. If `self.columns` is not `None`, then proceed with extracting column names for the query.

### Solution:
```python
from luigi.contrib import rdbms
from luigi.contrib.redshift import _CredentialsMixin
import logging

logger = logging.getLogger('luigi-interface')


class S3CopyToTable(rdbms.CopyToTable, _CredentialsMixin):
    
    # Function to define copy options, not relevant to the bug
    def copy_options(self):
        pass

    def copy(self, cursor, f):
        """
        Defines copying from s3 into redshift.
    
        If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
        """
        logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
        
        colnames = ''
        if self.columns is not None:
            colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
            colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)
    
        cursor.execute("""
         COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
         CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
         {options}
         ;""".format(
            table=self.table,
            colnames=colnames,
            source=f,
            creds=self._credentials(),
            options=self.copy_options())
        )
```

By modifying the `copy` function to first check if `self.columns` is `None` before operating on it, we can prevent the `TypeError` that was occurring previously. The corrected version will now handle the case when `self.columns` is `None` and behave accordingly.
