### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `copy` is part of the `S3CopyToTable` class which inherits from `rdbms.CopyToTable` and `_CredentialsMixin`.
2. The failing test `test_s3_copy_with_nonetype_columns` creates an instance of `DummyS3CopyToTableKey` with `columns` set to `None`, causing a `TypeError` when `len(self.columns)` is checked in the `copy` function.
3. The error occurs because the `columns` attribute is set to `None`, causing the function to attempt to call `len()` on a `NoneType`.
4. To fix this bug, we can add a check to verify if `self.columns` is `None` before trying to retrieve its length.

### Fix:
```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    
    if self.columns is not None and len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options())
    )
```

By adding the check `if self.columns is not None` before the length check, we ensure that the code won't try to access the length of a `NoneType` object, fixing the `TypeError` in the failing test.
