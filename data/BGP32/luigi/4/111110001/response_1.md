### Analyzing the buggy function

- The buggy function is `copy` inside the `S3CopyToTable` class from `luigi.contrib.redshift.py`.
- The `copy` function expects a `columns` attribute to be provided. However, in the failing test case, the `columns` attribute is set to `None`, causing a `TypeError` when trying to determine the length of `None`.
- The error occurs at line 338 of `luigi/contrib/redshift.py` when checking the length of `self.columns`.

### Potential error location

The bug is caused by the following line in the `copy` function:
```python
if len(self.columns) > 0:
```

### Cause of the bug

The bug occurs because the `columns` attribute is expected to be a valid list of columns, but in the failing test, it is set to `None`. The code tries to determine the length of `None`, resulting in a `TypeError`.

### Strategy for fixing the bug

To fix the bug, we need to handle the case where `columns` might be `None` gracefully. We can modify the condition to check if `columns` is not `None` before checking its length.

### Corrected version of the buggy function

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns is not None:  # Check if columns is not None before checking its length
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

By adding the validation `if self.columns is not None`, we ensure that we only try to process the columns if they actually exist, thus preventing the `TypeError` caused by `len(None)`.
