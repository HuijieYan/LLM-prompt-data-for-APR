### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `copy` within the `S3CopyToTable` class is expecting a non-None value for `self.columns` to determine the column names. However, in the failing test, `columns` is explicitly set to `None`, resulting in a `TypeError` in the line `if len(self.columns) > 0:` due to trying to perform `len()` on a NoneType object.
   
### Bug Cause:
The bug occurs because the `copy` function is assuming `self.columns` will always have a value, and it doesn't handle the case when `columns` is None.

### Strategy for fixing the bug:
To fix the bug, we need to add a check to handle the case when `self.columns` is None in the `copy` function.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    
    if self.columns is None:
        colnames = ''
    else:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options())
    )
```

With this change, the function will now handle the case when `self.columns` is None and avoid the TypeError.
