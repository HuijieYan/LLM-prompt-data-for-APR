### Analysis:
1. The error message indicates that a `TypeError` is raised in the `copy` function due to trying to determine the length of a `NoneType` object.
2. The buggy function is trying to get the length of the `self.columns` attribute without checking if it is `None` first.
3. The failing test `test_s3_copy_with_nonetype_columns` creates a `DummyS3CopyToTableKey` object with `columns` set to `None`, which causes the bug to surface.
4. The bug can be fixed by checking if `self.columns` is not `None` before trying to get its length.

### Fix Strategy:
1. Add a check to verify if `self.columns` is not `None`.
2. If `self.columns` is not `None`, proceed with getting the column names for the `COPY` statement.
3. If `self.columns` is `None`, assign an empty string to `colnames`.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    
    if self.columns is not None:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)
    else:
        colnames = ''

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

By adding the `if self.columns is not None` check, we ensure that the `copy` function can handle cases where `self.columns` might be `None`, preventing the `TypeError` that was occurring.
