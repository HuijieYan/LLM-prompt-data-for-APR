### Bug explanation
The bug in the `copy` function lies in how it's trying to access the `copy_options` method. In the string formatting within the `cursor.execute` call, `self.copy_options` is being treated as a method rather than calling the method and getting its return value. This results in `options=self.copy_options` assigning the method itself (not its return value) to the `options` parameter in the format string.

### Fix strategy
To fix the bug, the `copy_options` method needs to be properly called to get its return value before using it in the string formatting.

### Corrected version

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    options = self.copy_options()  # Call the method to get its return value

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=options)
    )
```

By making this change, the `copy_options` method is correctly called to retrieve its return value, which is then used in the `cursor.execute` call as intended. This corrected version should pass the failing test case provided.
