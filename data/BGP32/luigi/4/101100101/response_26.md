### Bug Explanation
The bug in the `copy` function lies in how the `copy_options` method is being called. In the buggy function, `self.copy_options` is being used directly without calling the method. This results in passing the method object itself as a parameter to the string formatting operation in the `cursor.execute` call.

### Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to call the `copy_options` method in the string formatting operation so that the return value of the method is used properly in the SQL query generated for execution.

### Corrected Version
```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options())
    )
```

By calling `self.copy_options()` instead of `self.copy_options`, we ensure that the `copy_options` method is executed and its return value is included in the SQL query.
