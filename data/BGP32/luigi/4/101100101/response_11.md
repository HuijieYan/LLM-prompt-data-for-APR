The bug in the provided function is due to a missing parentheses when calling the `copy_options` method. This results in the `options` placeholder in the SQL query not being replaced properly.

To fix this bug, we need to ensure that `self.copy_options()` is called as a method to get the correct options string.

Here is the corrected version of the `copy` function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options())  # Fix: Call copy_options() as a method
    )
```

Once this correction is applied, the `options` placeholder in the SQL query will be replaced correctly by the output of the `copy_options` method, and the buggy function should work as expected.
