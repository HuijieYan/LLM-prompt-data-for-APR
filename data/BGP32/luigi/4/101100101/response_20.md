### Bug Explanation

The bug in the `copy` function lies in the way the `copy_options` function is being passed as an argument in the string format using `{}`. The correct way to call the `copy_options` function is to add `()` after the function name to actually call it and get the return value.

In the buggy code:
```python
options=self.copy_options
```

Should be corrected to:
```python
options=self.copy_options()
```

### Update Strategy

1. Correct the line that calls the `copy_options` function to actually execute the function and get its return value.
2. Make sure the corrected function passes all the test cases provided.

### Corrected Version of the `copy` function
```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: luigi/contrib/redshift.py

# The declaration of the class containing the corrected function
class S3CopyToTable(rdbms.CopyToTable, _CredentialsMixin):
    # This function from the same class is called by the corrected function
    def copy_options(self):
        # Please ignore the body of this function



    # this is the corrected function
    def copy(self, cursor, f):
        """
        Defines copying from s3 into redshift.
    
        If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
        """
        logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
        colnames = ''
        if self.columns is not None:
            colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
            colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)
    
        cursor.execute("""
         COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
         CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
         {options}
         ;""".format(
            table=self.table,
            colnames=colnames,
            source=f,
            creds=self._credentials(),
            options=self.copy_options())
        )
```

After making this correction, the `copy` function should now correctly call the `copy_options` function to retrieve the options and execute the SQL query properly. This corrected version should pass the failing test.
