### Analysis
1. The buggy function `copy` is supposed to execute a `COPY` command on a Redshift table. It constructs the SQL query based on the provided parameters but has a bug in passing the `copy_options` function as a string instead of calling it.
2. The bug causes the `copy_options` function to be treated as a string placeholder in the SQL query instead of executing and returning the actual options string.
3. As a result, the `options` variable in the SQL query remains as `{options}` instead of being replaced with the actual options string, leading to an incomplete SQL query.
4. To fix the bug, we need to call the `copy_options` function to get the actual options string and replace `{options}` with it in the SQL query.

### Proposed Fix
1. Modify the `copy_options` function call in the SQL query to actually call the function and get the options string.
2. Update the `copy` function to call the `copy_options` function properly before constructing the SQL query.

### Corrected Version
```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    options = self.copy_options()  # Call the copy_options function to get options string

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=options)
    )
```

By making the above changes, the bug in the `copy` function should be fixed, and the corrected version should pass the failing test case provided.
