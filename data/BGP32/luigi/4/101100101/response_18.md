### Strategy for fixing the bug:
The bug in the `copy` function arises from incorrectly passing the `copy_options` method as a string instead of calling it to get the actual options as a string. To fix this bug, we need to make sure to call the `copy_options` method to get the correct options string before including it in the SQL query.

### Corrected version of the buggy function:
```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    # Call copy_options method to get options as a string
    copy_options_str = self.copy_options()

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=copy_options_str)
    )
```

By calling the `copy_options` method and storing the result as `copy_options_str`, the corrected version of the `copy` function now correctly includes the options string in the SQL query when executing the `COPY` statement. This fix ensures that the function behaves correctly and passes the failing test.
