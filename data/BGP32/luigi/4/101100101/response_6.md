The bug in the `copy` function arises from not calling the `copy_options` method to retrieve the options for the `COPY` statement. In the current implementation, `self.copy_options` is used directly, which is a reference to the method itself, rather than calling the method to get the actual options string.

To fix this bug, we need to call the `copy_options` method instead of referencing it directly. This will ensure that the options are correctly retrieved for the `COPY` statement.

Here is the corrected version of the `copy` function:
```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options())  # Call the copy_options method to get the options string
    )
```

With this correction, the `copy` function should now correctly fetch the options for the `COPY` statement and pass the failing test case provided.
