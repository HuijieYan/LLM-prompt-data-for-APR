### Analysis
The buggy function `copy` in the `S3CopyToTable` class is not correctly formatting the `COPY` SQL statement. The issue lies in how `colnames` and `options` are being passed into the string formatting in the `cursor.execute` statement.

### Bug Explanation
1. The `options` variable is being passed incorrectly as a function `self.copy_options` instead of calling the function `self.copy_options()`.
2. The `colnames` variable is being used in the SQL statement without considering if it is empty or not, which could potentially lead to syntax errors in the SQL query.

### Fix Strategy
1. Fix the `options` variable by calling the `self.copy_options()` function.
2. Handle the case when `colnames` is empty and make sure it doesn't cause syntax errors in the SQL query.

### Corrected Version
```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options())
    )
```

By applying these fixes, the `copy` function should now correctly format the `COPY` SQL statement and pass the test case provided.
