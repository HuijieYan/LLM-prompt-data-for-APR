The bug in the provided code is in the `copy` function where `self.copy_options` is called but not executed. In the buggy code, `self.copy_options` is a function, but it should be executed to get the actual options string.

To fix this bug, we need to execute `self.copy_options()` to get the correct options string before formatting it into the SQL query. 

Here is the corrected version of the `copy` function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    options = self.copy_options()  # Execute the copy_options function to get the options string

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=options)
    )
```

With this fix, the `copy` function will now execute `self.copy_options()` to get the actual options string before executing the SQL query.

This corrected version should now pass the failing test provided.
