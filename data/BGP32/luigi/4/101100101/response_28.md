The bug in the provided function is in the line where `self.copy_options` is being called without parentheses to actually execute the `copy_options` method. This results in passing the method object itself instead of its return value to the `options` parameter in the `cursor.execute` statement.

To fix this bug, we need to call the `copy_options` method by adding `()` after `self.copy_options`.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options())  # Call the copy_options method
    )
```

With this fix, the `copy_options` method will be executed correctly, and its return value will be passed to the `options` parameter in the `cursor.execute` statement. The corrected function should now pass the failing test case provided.
