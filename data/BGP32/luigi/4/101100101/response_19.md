### Analysis
The buggy function `copy` in the `S3CopyToTable` class seems to have a syntax error in building the SQL query string. The issue lies in passing `self.copy_options` without calling the function `copy_options()`.

### Bug
The bug is caused by not calling the `copy_options()` function to get the actual options string for the `COPY` query. This results in `self.copy_options` being passed as a function object rather than a string.

### Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to call the `copy_options()` function to retrieve the options string before constructing the `COPY` query.

### Corrected Version
```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    options = self.copy_options()  # Call the copy_options function to get the actual options string

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=options)
    )
```

By making this change, the `copy` function will now correctly call `copy_options()` and use the returned options string in the `COPY` query, resolving the bug.
