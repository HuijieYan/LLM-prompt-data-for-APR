The issue in the buggy function lies in the way `self.copy_options` is being used in the `cursor.execute` call. The `self.copy_options` is a method that needs to be called to return the actual options string, but in the buggy code, it is being passed as a reference to the method itself.

To fix this issue, we need to call the `self.copy_options` method to obtain the actual options string before passing it to the `cursor.execute` function.

Here is the corrected version of the buggy function:
```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: luigi/contrib/redshift.py

# The declaration of the class containing the corrected function
class S3CopyToTable(rdbms.CopyToTable, _CredentialsMixin):
    # This function from the same class is called by the buggy function
    def copy_options(self):
        # Please ignore the body of this function



    # The corrected function
    def copy(self, cursor, f):
        """
        Defines copying from s3 into redshift.
    
        If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
        """
        logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
        colnames = ''
        if len(self.columns) > 0:
            colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
            colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)
    
        options = self.copy_options()  # Call the method to get options
        
        cursor.execute("""
         COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
         CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
         {options}
         ;""".format(
            table=self.table,
            colnames=colnames,
            source=f,
            creds=self._credentials(),
            options=options)
        )
```

By calling `self.copy_options()` to obtain the options string and then passing it to the `cursor.execute` function, we ensure that the correct options are used in the SQL query.

This corrected version should now pass the failing test case provided.
