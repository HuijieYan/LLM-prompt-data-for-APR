### Bug Explanation
The bug in the `copy` function lies in the way the `copy_options` method is being called. Instead of calling the method `self.copy_options()` to get the result, the buggy code mistakenly assigns the method itself to the `options` variable without actually invoking it.

This results in the `options` variable being a reference to the method object instead of the actual options string, causing the SQL query to be incorrect and failing the test.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, the `copy_options` method should be called to retrieve the options string before including it in the SQL query. By invoking `self.copy_options()`, we will get the correct options string that needs to be added to the `COPY` command.

### Corrected Version
```python
# The corrected version of the buggy function
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options())
    )
```

By making this change and calling `self.copy_options()` to get the options string, the corrected function will properly format the SQL query and pass the failing test.
