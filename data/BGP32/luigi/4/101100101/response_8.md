The bug in the provided `copy` function is that the `copy_options` method is not being correctly invoked. In the `cursor.execute` call, `options=self.copy_options` should be `options=self.copy_options()`, as `copy_options` is a method that needs to be called.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the `copy_options` method is invoked correctly before passing it as an argument in the `cursor.execute` call.

Here is the corrected version of the `copy` function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options())
    )
```

By calling `self.copy_options()` with parentheses, we ensure that the `copy_options` method is correctly invoked before passing its return value as the `options` parameter in the `cursor.execute` call. This correction should resolve the bug and make the function work as intended in the failing test case.
