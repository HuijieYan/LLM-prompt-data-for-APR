The bug in the provided function is in the way the `copy_options` method is being called. In the `copy` method, `self.copy_options` should be a method call `self.copy_options()`, but it is missing parentheses, causing the method not to be executed and leading to incorrect behavior.

To fix the bug, we need to correctly call the `copy_options` method by adding parentheses after it in the string format.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: luigi/contrib/redshift.py

# The declaration of the class containing the buggy function
class S3CopyToTable(rdbms.CopyToTable, _CredentialsMixin):
    # This function from the same class is called by the buggy function
    def copy_options(self):
        # Please ignore the body of this function


    # Corrected version of the buggy function
    def copy(self, cursor, f):
        """
        Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

        If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
        """
        logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
        colnames = ''
        if len(self.columns) > 0:
            colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
            colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

        cursor.execute("""
         COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
         CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
         {options}
         ;""".format(
            table=self.table,
            colnames=colnames,
            source=f,
            creds=self._credentials(),
            options=self.copy_options())
        )
```

With this correction, the function will correctly call the `copy_options` method and incorporate its return value into the SQL query, fixing the bug and passing the failing test.
