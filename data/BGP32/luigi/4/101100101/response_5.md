### Bug Explanation:
The bug in the `copy` function is caused by passing the `self.copy_options` as a function reference `self.copy_options` instead of calling the function `self.copy_options()`. This results in `options=self.copy_options` being set to the function object instead of the result of calling the function.

### Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to call the `copy_options` function by adding `()` after it in the `cursor.execute` statement.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options())
    )
``` 

By making this change, the `copy` function will now call the `copy_options` function and use its return value properly. This corrected version should pass the failing test case provided.
