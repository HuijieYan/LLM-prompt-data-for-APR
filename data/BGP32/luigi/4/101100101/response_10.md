### Bug Explanation
The bug in the `copy` function lies in the way the `copy_options` function is being called. In the buggy code, `copy_options` is not called as a function but simply referenced as an attribute. This results in passing the function object itself to the `execute` method, instead of the return value of the `copy_options` function.

### Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to call the `copy_options` function within the `COPY` query string, so that its return value is used as intended.

### Corrected Version of the Function
```python
    def copy(self, cursor, f):
        """
        Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

        If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
        """
        logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
        colnames = ''
        if len(self.columns) > 0:
            colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
            colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

        cursor.execute("""
         COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
         CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
         {options}
         ;""".format(
            table=self.table,
            colnames=colnames,
            source=f,
            creds=self._credentials(),
            options=self.copy_options())  # Call the copy_options function
        )
```

By making this change, the `copy_options` function will be called correctly, and its return value will be included in the `COPY` query as intended. This corrected version should now pass the failing test case provided.
