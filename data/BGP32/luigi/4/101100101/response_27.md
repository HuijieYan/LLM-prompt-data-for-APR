### Bug Explanation
The bug in the `copy` function lies in the way `self.copy_options` is being used in the `cursor.execute` method call. The `copy_options` is a function in the `S3CopyToTable` class, but in the buggy code, it's being used as a variable without invoking it. This results in passing the function object itself instead of the function return value to the `cursor.execute` method, causing an error during execution.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix this bug, we need to make sure to call the `copy_options` function and use its return value in the `cursor.execute` method.

### Corrected Version of the Function
```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options())  # Call the function to get the return value
    )
```

By making the above correction, the `copy` function should now use the return value of the `copy_options` function correctly in the `cursor.execute` method, resolving the bug.
