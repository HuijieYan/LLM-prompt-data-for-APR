### Cause of the bug:
The bug in the `copy()` function is caused by passing the `copy_options` method as a string rather than calling the method to get the actual copy options string. This results in the `options` parameter in the `COPY` statement being set to the string representation of the method, causing the query execution to fail.

### Strategy for fixing the bug:
To fix the bug, we need to call the `copy_options` method to get the actual copy options string before formatting the `COPY` statement.

### Corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options())  # Call the method to get the copy options string
    )
```

By calling `self.copy_options()` inside the `format()` method, we ensure that the actual copy options string is used in the `COPY` statement. This corrected version of the function should now pass the failing test case provided.
