Given the buggy function and the failing test provided, the main issue lies in how `self.copy_options` is being used in the `cursor.execute` statement. The buggy function is not actually calling the `copy_options` function to retrieve the value. Instead, it is passing the function itself as a parameter.

To fix this bug, we need to call the `copy_options` function to get the actual options string and then pass that value to the `cursor.execute` statement.

Here is the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)
    
    # Call the copy_options function to get the options string
    options = self.copy_options()
    
    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=options)
    )
```

With this correction, the `copy_options` function is now being called to retrieve the options string and then passed correctly to the `cursor.execute` statement.

This corrected version should now pass the failing test with the expected input/output values.
