The bug in the provided code is in the `copy_options` function call within the `cursor.execute` statement. In the buggy code, `self.copy_options` is not being called as a function.

To fix this bug, we need to call `self.copy_options()` as a function to get the actual value returned by the `copy_options` function.

Here is the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options())
    )
```

By making this change, the `copy_options` function will be correctly called and the bug will be fixed. This corrected version should now pass the failing test case provided.
