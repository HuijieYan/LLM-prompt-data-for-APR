### Bug Explanation
The buggy function `copy` is failing to properly format the `COPY` SQL statement due to a missing function call for `copy_options` and incorrect formatting for the `colnames` variable. This results in an improper SQL query being executed, leading to a failure in the test case.

### Bug Fix Strategy
1. Correctly call the `copy_options` function to include the actual options.
2. Ensure proper formatting for the `colnames` variable.

### Corrected Version of the Function
```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options())
    )
```

By correcting the function as shown above, the issue with formatting the `COPY` SQL statement should be resolved, and the function should pass the failing test.
