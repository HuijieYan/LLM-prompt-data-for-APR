The bug in the provided function is that `self.copy_options` is not being called as a function in the `cursor.execute` statement. It should be `self.copy_options()`. This is causing the copy_options function not to be executed, leading to incorrect behavior.

To fix this bug, we need to ensure that `self.copy_options` is called as a function to properly include the options in the SQL query.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options())
    )
```

With this correction, the `copy_options` function will be properly executed, and the function should now behave as expected and pass the failing test.
