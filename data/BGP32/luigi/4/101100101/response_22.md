The bug in the provided function is in the line where `options=self.copy_options` is used in the `cursor.execute` call. The `copy_options` is a function, but it is not being called correctly in this context.

To fix the bug, we need to make sure to call the `copy_options` function before passing its result as a string to the `options` variable in the `cursor.execute` call.

Here is the corrected version of the `copy` function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    options = self.copy_options()

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=options)
    )
```

This corrected version of the `copy` function ensures that the `copy_options` function is properly called to get the options string before executing the SQL `COPY` statement.

With this correction, the function should now pass the failing test provided.
