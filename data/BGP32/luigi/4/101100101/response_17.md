### Cause of the bug
The bug in the `copy` function is due to how the `copy_options` function is being called. In the buggy code, `self.copy_options` is used without actually calling the function, resulting in `options=self.copy_options` being assigned the function object itself rather than the return value of the function. This causes the SQL query to include the function object `def copy_options(self)` instead of the intended options string.

### Strategy for fixing the bug
To fix the bug, we need to call the `copy_options` function to get the actual options string before inserting it into the SQL query. This can be achieved by adding `()` after `self.copy_options` to call the function and retrieve the return value.

### Corrected version of the buggy function

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options())
    )
```

By adding `()` after `self.copy_options`, the `copy_options` function will be called to obtain the actual options string, which will then be correctly inserted into the SQL query. This corrected version of the function should now pass the failing test case provided.
