### Bug Analysis
The bug in the `copy` function lies in how the `copy_options` function is being called. In the current implementation, `copy_options` is being passed as a method reference without actually calling it. This results in `options=self.copy_options` being set to the function itself, rather than the return value of the function.

### Bug Explanation
In the failing test, the expected `options=''` value is not being correctly set as the `options` parameter when calling `cursor.execute`. This is because the `copy_options` function is not being called to retrieve the correct options string. As a result, the `options` parameter remains as the function reference instead of the expected options string.

### Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to call the `copy_options` function to retrieve the correct options string before setting the `options` parameter in the `cursor.execute` call.

### Corrected Version
```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    options = self.copy_options()  # Call copy_options function to get the correct options string
    
    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=options)
    )
```

By calling the `copy_options` function and assigning its return value to the `options` variable, we can ensure that the correct options string is used in the `cursor.execute` call. This corrected version should now pass the failing test case.
