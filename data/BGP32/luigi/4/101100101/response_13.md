### Bug Explanation:
The bug in the `copy` function is that `self.copy_options` is not being called as a function. It is missing `()` at the end, so it is not actually executing the `copy_options` function to get the options string. As a result, the `options` parameter in the `cursor.execute` call is set to the function object itself rather than the result of calling the function.

### Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to correctly call the `self.copy_options` function to get the options string that should be passed to the `cursor.execute` call.

### Corrected Version:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options())  # Corrected by adding () to call the function
    )
``` 

With this correction, the `copy_options` function will be correctly used to get the options string for the `cursor.execute` call, resolving the bug.
