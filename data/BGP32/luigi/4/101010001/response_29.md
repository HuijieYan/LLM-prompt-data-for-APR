## Analysis:
The error message indicates a `TypeError` caused by trying to get the length of a `NoneType` object (`self.columns`) in the `copy` function. The buggy function intended to check if there are any columns defined for the table, but it failed because `self.columns` is `None`.

## Error Location:
The buggy line causing the error is:
```python
if len(self.columns) > 0:
```

## Cause of the Bug:
The bug is caused by not handling the case when `self.columns` is `None`. Since the buggy function assumes that `self.columns` will always be a list, it causes a `TypeError` when it tries to get the length of `None`.

## Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to first check if `self.columns` is `None` before trying to get its length. If `self.columns` is `None`, we can assign an empty list to `colnames` directly without further processing.

## Corrected Version:
```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns is not None:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

By checking if `self.columns` is `None` before trying to access its length, we prevent the `TypeError` in case `self.columns` is not defined.
