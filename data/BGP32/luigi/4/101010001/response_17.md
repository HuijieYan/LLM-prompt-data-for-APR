### Analysis:
1. The `copy` function in the `S3CopyToTable` class is supposed to copy data from S3 into Redshift. 
2. The error occurs due to `self.columns` being `None` instead of a list, which leads to a `TypeError` when trying to get the length of `None`.
3. The error message clearly states that it is a `TypeError` due to trying to get the length of a `NoneType` object.
4. To fix the bug, we need to check if `self.columns` is `None` before trying to access its length and handle this case appropriately.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Check if `self.columns` is `None` before trying to access its length.
2. If `self.columns` is not `None`, proceed with generating the column names.
3. If `self.columns` is `None`, handle it so that the code does not try to generate column names and avoids the `TypeError`.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:  # Check if self.columns is not None before accessing length
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options())
    )
```

In the corrected version, we have added a check `if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0` to ensure that we only try to generate column names if `self.columns` is not `None`. This change will prevent the `TypeError` that was occurring due to trying to get the length of `None`.
