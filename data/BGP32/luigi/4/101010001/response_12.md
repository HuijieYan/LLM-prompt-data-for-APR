### Analysis:
1. The error message indicates a `TypeError` caused by trying to call `len()` on a `NoneType` object within the `copy()` function.
2. The bug is occurring within the `copy()` function where it checks the length of `self.columns`.
3. The cause of the bug is that `self.columns` is `None`, and we are trying to call `len()` on it, resulting in a `TypeError`.
4. To fix the bug, we need to handle the case where `self.columns` is `None` before trying to get its length.

### Bug Fix:
```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options())
    )
```

In the fixed version of the `copy()` function, we check if `self.columns` is not `None` before trying to get its length. This modification ensures that the `TypeError` related to `NoneType` is avoided, and the function should now work correctly.
