### Analysis:
1. The function `copy` is supposed to copy data from S3 into Redshift.
2. The error occurs when checking the length of `self.columns`, which is None in this case, resulting in a `TypeError`.
3. The bug is caused by trying to get the length of a `NoneType` object, `self.columns`.
4. To fix the bug, we need to check if `self.columns` is not None before trying to get its length.
5. We can modify the code to account for the case where `self.columns` is None.

### Bug Fix:
```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:  # Check if self.columns is not None
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options())
    )
```

By adding the check `if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:` before trying to get the length of `self.columns`, we prevent the `TypeError` when `self.columns` is None. This fix will ensure that the function runs without errors and the test should pass successfully.
