1. The buggy function `copy` in the `S3CopyToTable` class within the `luigi/contrib/redshift.py` file is failing due to a `TypeError` caused by trying to get the length of `None` type in the line `if len(self.columns) > 0:`.

2. The potential error location within the buggy function is the line `if len(self.columns) > 0:` where it is assumed that `self.columns` is always a list.

3. The buggy function is trying to check the length of `self.columns` assuming it's a list. However, in the failing test, the constructor `DummyS3CopyToTableKey` is called with `columns=None`, which results in `self.columns` being of type `NoneType`. Consequently, when trying to get the length of `None`, it raises a `TypeError` as 'NoneType' objects do not have a length.

4. To fix this bug, we need to handle the case where `self.columns` might be `None` before trying to get its length. A simple way to achieve this is by using a conditional check to ensure `self.columns` is not `None` before checking its length.

5. Here is the corrected version of the buggy `copy` function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns is not None and len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

By adding the conditional check `if self.columns is not None and len(self.columns) > 0:`, we ensure that we are only trying to get the length of `self.columns` when it is not `None`, thus fixing the `TypeError` issue.
