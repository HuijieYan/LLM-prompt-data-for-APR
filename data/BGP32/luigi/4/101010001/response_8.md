### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `copy` is trying to check the length of `self.columns` which results in a `TypeError` since `self.columns` is `None`.
2. The `copy` function should handle the case where `self.columns` is `None`.
3. The error message clearly indicates that the issue is with the line `if len(self.columns) > 0:` where `self.columns` is a `NoneType`.

### Strategy for fixing the bug:
To fix the bug, we need to handle the case where `self.columns` is `None` by adding a check to ensure it is not `None` before trying to get its length.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns is not None and len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

By adding the check `if self.columns is not None:` before checking its length, we ensure that the `TypeError` will not occur when `self.columns` is `None`. This corrected version should now handle the case where `self.columns` is `None` without throwing any errors.
