### Analysis:
1. The `copy` function in the `S3CopyToTable` class is attempting to access the length of `self.columns` without handling the case where `self.columns` might be `None`. In the failing test, `columns` is passed as `None`, causing a `TypeError` when checking its length.
2. The function `copy_options` is responsible for generating the options to be used during the `COPY` command in Redshift, but it's currently not been called correctly in the `copy` function. The bug is causing `self.copy_options` to be interpreted as a reference to the function itself rather than calling the function.
   
### Bug Cause:
The bug occurred due to a missing function call in the string formatting part of the `cursor.execute` call. The `options=self.copy_options` should be `options=self.copy_options()`, so that the result of the function is used as the string.

### Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, ensure that `self.copy_options` is correctly called to return the desired options string. Additionally, handle the case where `self.columns` is `None` before checking its length to avoid the `TypeError`.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:  # Check if self.columns is not None before checking length
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options()  # Call the function to get the options string
    )
)
``` 

After applying these changes, the corrected version of the `copy` function should now properly call the `copy_options` function and check for `None` before accessing the length of `self.columns`.
