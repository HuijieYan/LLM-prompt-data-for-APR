### Analysis:
The buggy function `copy` within the `S3CopyToTable` class is failing due to a `TypeError: object of type 'NoneType' has no len()` error. The error occurs when trying to retrieve the length of `self.columns` which is `None`. This issue arises because the buggy function does not handle the case where `self.columns` can be `None` properly. The buggy function assumes `self.columns` will always be a list with at least one element, leading to the error when it encounters a `NoneType`.

### Bug Location:
The buggy location is in the line:
```python
if len(self.columns) > 0:
```

### Bug Cause:
The cause of the bug is that the buggy function assumes `self.columns` will always be a list, but in some cases, it can be `None` which leads to the `TypeError` when trying to get the length of `None`.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to handle the case where `self.columns` can be `None` before trying to get the length. We can add a check to ensure that `self.columns` is not `None` before proceeding with creating the `colnames` string.

### Corrected Version:
Below is the corrected version of the `copy` function within the `S3CopyToTable` class:

```python
    def copy(self, cursor, f):
        """
        Defines copying from s3 into redshift.
    
        If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
        """
        logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
        colnames = ''
        if self.columns is not None and len(self.columns) > 0:
            colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
            colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)
    
        cursor.execute("""
         COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
         CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
         {options}
         ;""".format(
            table=self.table,
            colnames=colnames,
            source=f,
            creds=self._credentials(),
            options=self.copy_options())
        )
```

In this corrected version, we added a check `if self.columns is not None and len(self.columns) > 0:` before attempting to construct the `colnames` string. This check ensures that we only proceed if `self.columns` is not `None` and has at least one element. Additionally, in the `cursor.execute()` call, we also added `()` to `self.copy_options` to correctly call the function and retrieve its options.
