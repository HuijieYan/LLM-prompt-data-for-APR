1. The buggy function is `copy()` within the `S3CopyToTable` class in `luigi/contrib/redshift.py` file. The error message indicates a `TypeError` when trying to get the length of `self.columns`. The root cause of the bug is trying to check the length of `NoneType` object.

2. The potential error location is the line:
```python
if len(self.columns) > 0:
```

3. The cause of the bug is that the `columns` attribute is potentially `None`, which results in the `TypeError` when trying to get the length of `None`.

4. To fix this bug, we need to handle the case when `self.columns` is `None` before trying to get its length. We can achieve this by adding a check to see if `self.columns` is not `None` before checking its length.

5. Here is the corrected version of the `copy()` function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    
    if self.columns is not None and len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
``` 

By adding the check `if self.columns is not None and len(self.columns) > 0`, we ensure that we only try to get the length of `self.columns` if it is not `None`. This will prevent the `TypeError` and fix the bug.
