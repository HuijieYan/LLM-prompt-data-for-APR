### Analysis:
1. The `copy` function in the `S3CopyToTable` class is trying to access the length of the `self.columns` attribute, which is causing a `TypeError` because it is of type `NoneType` according to the error message.
2. The bug is occurring due to the `self.columns` attribute being `None`, and the function is trying to check its length without handling the case where `self.columns` is `None`.
3. The error message clearly indicates that `object of type 'NoneType' has no len()`, pointing to the exact line causing the bug.
4. To fix the bug, we need to handle the scenario where `self.columns` is `None` by checking for `None` before trying to access its length.
5. By adding a check for `None` before accessing the length of `self.columns`, we can prevent the `TypeError` and ensure that the function works correctly.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns is not None and len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
``` 

By adding the `if self.columns is not None and len(self.columns) > 0:` condition before trying to access the length of `self.columns`, we prevent the `TypeError` when `self.columns` is None and ensure that the function runs without any errors.
