### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `copy` is trying to check the length of `self.columns` which is causing an error because `self.columns` is `None`.
2. The error message indicates the issue is with the line where the length of `self.columns` is being checked.
3. The error occurs because the `columns` parameter is passed as `None` in the `DummyS3CopyToTableKey` instance, causing the `TypeError` when trying to get the length of `None`.
4. The strategy for fixing the bug is to check if `self.columns` is not `None` before trying to access its length.

### Corrected Version:
```python
class S3CopyToTable(rdbms.CopyToTable, _CredentialsMixin):
    def copy_options(self):
        # Please ignore the body of this function

    def copy(self, cursor, f):
        logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
        colnames = ''
        if self.columns is not None and len(self.columns) > 0:  # Check if self.columns is not None
            colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
            colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)
    
        cursor.execute("""
         COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
         CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
         {options}
         ;""".format(
            table=self.table,
            colnames=colnames,
            source=f,
            creds=self._credentials(),
            options=self.copy_options())
        )
```

In the corrected version, I added a check `if self.columns is not None` before trying to check the length of `self.columns`. This will prevent the `TypeError` when `self.columns` is `None`. Additionally, I corrected the call to `copy_options` by adding parentheses to execute the function and retrieve its result.
