### Analysis:
1. The buggy function is `copy(self, cursor, f)` within the `S3CopyToTable` class in `luigi/contrib/redshift.py` file.
2. The error message indicates a `TypeError: object of type 'NoneType' has no len()`, which suggests that the `self.columns` attribute is `None`.
3. The buggy function is trying to check the length of `self.columns` without handling the case where `self.columns` is `None`, causing the `TypeError`.
4. To fix this bug, a check needs to be added to ensure that `self.columns` is not `None` before trying to access its length. Additionally, some default behavior should be defined if `self.columns` is `None`.
5. The corrected version of the function should include a conditional check for `self.columns` and provide a default behavior when `self.columns` is `None`.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns is not None and len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
``` 

By adding the check `if self.columns is not None and len(self.columns) > 0:`, we ensure that the code only attempts to get the length of `self.columns` if it is not `None`. This modification will prevent the `TypeError` when `self.columns` is `None`.
