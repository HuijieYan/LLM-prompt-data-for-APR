## Analysis:
The buggy function `copy` in the `S3CopyToTable` class is attempting to check the length of `self.columns` without ensuring that `self.columns` actually has a value. This results in a `TypeError` when trying to check the length of a `NoneType` object.

## Bug:
The bug in the function is that it is trying to check the length of `self.columns` without verifying if it is `None` or not. This raises a `TypeError` because it is not safe to perform operations like `len()` on a `NoneType` object.

## Fix:
To fix this bug, we need to check if `self.columns` is `None` before trying to access its length. This can be achieved using an `if` condition to ensure that we only try to determine the length of `self.columns` if it is not `None`.

Here is the corrected version of the `copy` function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns is not None and len(self.columns) > 0:  # Check if self.columns is not None before checking length
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

By adding the check `if self.columns is not None and len(self.columns) > 0`, we ensure that the length of `self.columns` is only accessed if it is not `None`. This will prevent the `TypeError` from occurring and the function should now work correctly.
