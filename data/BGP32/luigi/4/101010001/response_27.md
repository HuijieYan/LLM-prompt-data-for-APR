1. The buggy function `copy` in the `S3CopyToTable` class within the `luigi/contrib/redshift.py` file is attempting to access the length of `self.columns`, which is causing a `TypeError` when `self.columns` is `None`.
   
2. The potential error location is identified in the line:
```python
if len(self.columns) > 0:
```

3. The bug occurs because the `columns` attribute of the `S3CopyToTable` instance is being set to `None` which leads to a `TypeError` when attempting to get its length in the buggy function `copy`.

4. To fix the bug, we need to handle the case where `self.columns` is `None` before trying to access its length.

5. Here is the corrected version of the `copy` function in the `S3CopyToTable` class:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:  # Check if self.columns is not None
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

With this correction, the `copy` function will only attempt to get the length of `self.columns` if it is not `None`, avoiding the `TypeError` that was occurring when `self.columns` was `None`.
