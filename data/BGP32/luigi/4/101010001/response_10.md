1. The buggy function `copy` in the `S3CopyToTable` class within the `luigi.contrib.redshift.py` file is attempting to access the length of `self.columns` without performing a check for `None` values. This results in a `TypeError` when trying to determine the length of a `NoneType` object.

2. The potential error location within the buggy function is at the line:
```python
if len(self.columns) > 0:
```

3. The cause of the bug is that `self.columns` is being accessed without checking if it is `None` or not. In this specific test case, `columns` are passed as `None` when creating the `DummyS3CopyToTableKey` object. Therefore, attempting to get the length of `None` throws a `TypeError`.

4. To fix the bug, a check is needed to see if `self.columns` is not `None` before proceeding to check its length. This check will prevent the `TypeError` when `self.columns` is `None`. Additionally, the `options` attribute in the string formatting of the SQL query should be called as a function `self.copy_options()`.

5. Here is the corrected version of the `copy` function:
```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns is not None and len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options())
    )
```

By adding the `if self.columns is not None:` check before trying to access the length of `self.columns`, we avoid the `TypeError` issue. Additionally, calling `self.copy_options()` instead of just `self.copy_options` in the SQL query template string ensures the correct function call.
