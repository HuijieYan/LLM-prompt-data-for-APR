### Analysis:
The buggy function `copy` is trying to access the length of `self.columns`, which may be `None`. This causes a `TypeError` when comparing `None` with an integer in the condition `if len(self.columns) > 0:`. The `copy_options` attribute is also incorrectly referenced as a method instead of calling it as a function.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is caused by not handling the case where `self.columns` is `None` before trying to access its length in the `if` condition.

### Fix Strategy:
1. Check if `self.columns` is `None` before attempting to access its length.
2. Call `self.copy_options()` as a function to retrieve the copy options.

### Updated Corrected Version:
```python
class S3CopyToTable(rdbms.CopyToTable, _CredentialsMixin):
    def copy_options(self):
        # Please ignore the body of this function



    def copy(self, cursor, f):
        """
        Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

        If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
        """
        logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
        
        colnames = ''
        if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:
            colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
            colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)
        
        cursor.execute("""
         COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
         CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
         {options}
         ;""".format(
            table=self.table,
            colnames=colnames,
            source=f,
            creds=self._credentials(),
            options=self.copy_options())
        )
```

With this correction, the code now checks if `self.columns` is not `None` before trying to access its length, preventing the `TypeError` that was occurring. It also correctly calls `self.copy_options()` as a function to retrieve the copy options.
