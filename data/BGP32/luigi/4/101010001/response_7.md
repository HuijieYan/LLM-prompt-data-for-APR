1. The buggy function `copy` within the `S3CopyToTable` class in `luigi/contrib/redshift.py` is attempting to check the length of `self.columns` without handling the case where `self.columns` might be `None`. This leads to a `TypeError` being raised when trying to call `len` on a `NoneType` object.

2. The potential error location is within the line:
   ```python
   if len(self.columns) > 0:
   ```
   This line assumes that `self.columns` is always a list or an iterable object, but it can be `None` based on the error message.

3. The bug is caused by attempting to check the length of `self.columns` without considering the case where `self.columns` could be `None`. When `self.columns` is `None`, the code attempts to call `len(None)`, resulting in a `TypeError`.

4. To fix the bug, we need to check if `self.columns` is `None` before trying to get its length. If it is `None`, we can set `colnames` to an empty string, indicating that no columns need to be copied.

5. Here is the corrected version of the `copy` function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    
    # Check if self.columns is not None before processing it
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns is not None and len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options())
    )
```

In the corrected version, we first check if `self.columns` is not `None` before attempting to find its length. If `self.columns` is `None`, we set `colnames` to an empty string. This change will prevent the `TypeError` that was previously raised.
