### Analysis:
The buggy function `copy` in the `S3CopyToTable` class is trying to access the `columns` attribute of the instance `self`. In the failing test, the `columns` attribute is set to `None`, leading to a `TypeError` when trying to check its length.

### Identified Potential Error Location:
The line causing the issue is:
```python
if len(self.columns) > 0:
```

### Cause of the Bug:
The bug is caused by the fact that the `columns` attribute of the instance `self` is set to `None` in the failing test. When trying to access the length of `None` in the `copy` function, it results in a `TypeError`.

### Suggested Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to handle the case where `self.columns` might be `None`. We can check if `self.columns` is not `None` before trying to access its length.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options())
    )
```

In the corrected version, we first check if `self.columns` is not `None` before attempting to access its length. This modification ensures that the function does not throw a `TypeError` when `self.columns` is `None`.
