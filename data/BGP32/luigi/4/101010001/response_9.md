1. The buggy function `copy` in the `S3CopyToTable` class from the `luigi.contrib.redshift` module is supposed to copy data from S3 into Redshift. The error message indicates that the code is trying to get the length of `self.columns`, which is resulting in a `TypeError` due to `self.columns` being of type `None`.

2. The potential error location within the buggy function is in the line:
   ```python
   if len(self.columns) > 0:
   ```
   This line is attempting to check the length of `self.columns` without verifying if it is `None` or not.

3. The cause of the bug is that the code does not handle the case where `self.columns` is `None`, leading to a `TypeError` when trying to get the length of `None`.

4. To fix the bug, a strategy can be to first check if `self.columns` is not `None` before attempting to get its length.

5. Here is the corrected version of the `copy` function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns is not None and len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

By checking if `self.columns` is not `None` before accessing its length, we ensure that the function does not throw a `TypeError` when trying to get the length of `None`.
