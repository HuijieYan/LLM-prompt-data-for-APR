### Analysis:
- The error message indicates a `TypeError` due to trying to get the length of a `NoneType` object in the buggy function `copy`.
- The buggy function accesses the `self.columns` attribute which could be of type `None`, causing the error.
- The `TypeError: object of type 'NoneType' has no len()` occurs on line 338 where `len(self.columns)` is being checked without handling the `NoneType` case.

### Bug Cause:
- The bug is caused by not handling the case where `self.columns` is `None`, resulting in a `TypeError` when trying to get the length of `None`.

### Fix Strategy:
- Check if `self.columns` is `None` before trying to get its length. If it's `None`, set `colnames` to an empty string to avoid the `TypeError`.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns is not None:  # Check if self.columns is not None
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

### Summary:
The corrected version ensures that the buggy function handles the case where `self.columns` is `None` by setting `colnames` to an empty string in such cases. This fix prevents the `TypeError` that was occurring when trying to access the length of a `NoneType` object.
