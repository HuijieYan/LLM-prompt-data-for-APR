### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `copy` within the `S3CopyToTable` class in `luigi/contrib/redshift.py` is attempting to check the length of `self.columns` without verifying if it's `None`, leading to a `TypeError` when `columns` is `None`.
2. The failing test `test_s3_copy_with_nonetype_columns` from `test/contrib/redshift_test.py` mocks the `cursor` and expects a specific `COPY` SQL string to be executed, triggering the error due to the `None` value of `columns`.
3. The error message indicates a `TypeError` due to attempting to get the length of a `NoneType` object, causing the test to fail.
4. The GitHub issue associated with this bug provides insights into the root cause and suggests a possible fix by checking for both `self.columns` existence and its length before proceeding.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
- Modify the buggy function `copy` to check if `self.columns` is not `None` before determining its length to prevent the `TypeError`. This aligns with the suggested solution in the GitHub issue.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

By updating the `copy` function to include the check `if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:`, the corrected version should now successfully handle the case where `columns` is `None`, resolving the `TypeError` issue and passing the failing test.
