### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `copy` within the `S3CopyToTable` class is trying to check the length of `self.columns` to determine if columns are provided. However, when `columns` is `None`, it results in a `TypeError`.
2. The failing test is attempting to run the `copy` function with `columns=None`.
3. The error message indicates that the `columns` attribute is of type `NoneType`, leading to the `TypeError`.
4. The GitHub issue links the problem to a specific pull request where the bug was introduced and suggests a potential solution.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
- Modify the condition for checking the length of `self.columns` to account for the case where `columns` is `None`.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:  # Check for None and then length
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

By implementing this change in the buggy function, the corrected version of the function should now correctly handle the situation where `self.columns` is `None` and prevent the `TypeError` from occurring.
