### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `copy` in the `S3CopyToTable` class of the `redshift.py` file is attempting to check the length of `self.columns`, which results in a `TypeError` when `self.columns` is `None`.
2. The failing test `test_s3_copy_with_nonetype_columns` is mocking the situation where `columns=None` is passed to the `S3CopyToTable` task, triggering the bug.
3. The error message indicates that the issue is with trying to get the length of `NoneType` object.
4. The GitHub issue provides additional context on the problem and suggests a possible solution to avoid the error by checking for `self.columns` validity before checking its length.

### Bug Cause:
The bug occurs because the code directly attempts to check the length of `self.columns` without first confirming if `self.columns` is not `None`.

### Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we will update the condition checking the length of `self.columns` to also validate that `self.columns` is not `None` before checking its length.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns is not None and len(self.columns) > 0:  # Check if self.columns is not None
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

By adding the condition `if self.columns is not None and len(self.columns) > 0:`, we ensure that the bug causing the `TypeError` when `self.columns` is `None` is fixed. This corrected version should pass the failing test and address the issue reported on GitHub.
