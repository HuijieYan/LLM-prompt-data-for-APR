### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `copy` in the `S3CopyToTable` class is failing when `self.columns` is `None`. This failure causes a `TypeError` due to trying to calculate the length of a `NoneType` object.
2. The failing test `test_s3_copy_with_nonetype_columns` creates an instance of `DummyS3CopyToTableKey` with `columns` set to `None` and then calls the `run` method, which in turn calls the `copy` method.
3. The error message clearly shows a `TypeError` being raised at line 338 of the `luigi/contrib/redshift.py` file, indicating the issue with `len(self.columns)` when `self.columns` is `None`.
4. The GitHub issue provides useful context about this bug, pointing out that the problematic line could be modified to handle `self.columns` being `None` before performing a length check.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is caused by trying to calculate the length of `self.columns` without checking if it is `None`. When `self.columns` is `None`, the code raises a `TypeError` as expected.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to modify the `if` condition in the `copy` function to explicitly handle the case where `self.columns` is `None`. This will prevent the `TypeError` from occurring, and the function should behave as expected.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options())
    )
```

By adding the `if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:` check, we ensure that the length of `self.columns` is only calculated when `self.columns` is not `None`, thus addressing the bug mentioned in the GitHub issue.
