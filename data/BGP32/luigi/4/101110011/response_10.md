## Analysis:
1. The buggy function `copy` in the class `S3CopyToTable` has an issue where it tries to access the length of `self.columns`, which is `None` resulting in a `TypeError`.
2. The failing test `test_s3_copy_with_nonetype_columns` creates an instance of `DummyS3CopyToTableKey` with `columns=None` and triggers the `copy` function which leads to the error.
3. The error message clearly indicates that the bug is caused by trying to get the length of a `NoneType` object.
4. The proposed solution mentioned in the GitHub issue suggests checking if `self.columns` is not `None` before trying to get its length.

## Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Modify the condition checking in the `copy` function to first verify if `self.columns` is not `None`, and then proceed to check its length.
2. By updating the conditional check as suggested in the GitHub issue, the bug can be fixed.

## Corrected Version:
```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:  # Check if self.columns is not None
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

By making this change in the `copy` function, the bug should be fixed, and the failing test `test_s3_copy_with_nonetype_columns` should pass successfully.
