## Solution:

### Analysis:
The buggy function `copy(self, cursor, f)` in the `S3CopyToTable` class from `luigi/contrib/redshift.py` is causing a `TypeError` due to checking the length of `self.columns` without verifying if it's not `None`. The related failing test `test_s3_copy_with_nonetype_columns` presents the issue by passing `columns=None` to the `DummyS3CopyToTableKey` task, triggering the error.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is caused by attempting to check the length of `self.columns` without ensuring it's not `None`. Since `columns` is passed as `None`, trying to get the length directly results in a `TypeError`.

### Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to update the conditional check to first verify if `self.columns` is not `None` before checking its length. This will prevent the `TypeError` when `columns` is `None`.

### Updated Code:
Below is the corrected version of the `copy` function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

By adding the condition `if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0`, we prevent trying to get the length of `self.columns` when it is `None`. This corrected version will resolve the `TypeError` issue reported in the GitHub bug.
