### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `copy` in the `S3CopyToTable` class is failing due to trying to get the length of `self.columns`, which is set to `None`.
2. The test function `test_s3_copy_with_nonetype_columns` is mocking the `DummyS3CopyToTableKey` task with `columns=None`, leading to the TypeError during execution.
3. The error message indicates that the issue is with trying to get the length of a `NoneType` object in the line `if len(self.columns) > 0:`.
4. The GitHub issue suggests updating the line to check if `self.columns` is not None before getting the length to address the bug.

### Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug:
- Update the line `if len(self.columns) > 0:` to `if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:` to handle the case where `self.columns` is None.

### Corrected Version of the buggy function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:  # Check if columns is not None
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

By making this change in the `copy` function, the code should now handle the case when `self.columns` is `None` and rectify the TypeError issue.
