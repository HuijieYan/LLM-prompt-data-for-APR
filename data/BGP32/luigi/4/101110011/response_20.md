## Analyzing the bug in the provided function and related test code:

1. The buggy function `copy` in the `S3CopyToTable` class from `luigi/contrib/redshift.py` is failing due to an error with the `self.columns` attribute. The error occurs when trying to access the length of `self.columns`, which is `None` in the failing test case.
   
2. The failing test case `test_s3_copy_with_nonetype_columns` creates an instance of `DummyS3CopyToTableKey` setting `columns=None`, causing the bug to trigger when calling `task.run()`.
   
3. The error message indicates a `TypeError: object of type 'NoneType' has no len()`, precisely reflecting the issue with trying to access the length of a `NoneType` object.

4. The GitHub issue suggests a potential solution by changing the condition to `if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:`, which would prevent the error when `self.columns` is `None`.

## Bug Fix Strategy:
To address this bug, we need to modify the condition in the `copy` function to check if `self.columns` is not `None` before attempting to access its length.

## Corrected Version of the Buggy Function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    
    if self.columns is not None and len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

By updating the condition to check if `self.columns` is not `None`, we can prevent the `TypeError` from occurring. This corrected version should now pass the failing test and resolve the issue reported on GitHub.
