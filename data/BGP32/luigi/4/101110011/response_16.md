### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `copy` in the `S3CopyToTable` class is expecting `self.columns` to be a list, but it is passing `None` to it in the failing test.
2. The error is occurring at the line `if len(self.columns) > 0:` because `self.columns` is `None` in this case, leading to a `TypeError`.
3. The error message indicates that an object of type 'NoneType' has no length.
4. The GitHub issue suggests updating the condition to `if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:` to prevent this error.

### Updated Corrected Version:
```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options())
    )
```

By updating the condition in the `copy` function to check if `self.columns` is not `None` before checking its length, we can avoid the `TypeError`. This corrected version aligns with the suggested solution in the GitHub issue and should resolve the error.
