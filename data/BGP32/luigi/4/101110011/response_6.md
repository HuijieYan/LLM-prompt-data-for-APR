## Analyzing the buggy function

1. The buggy function `copy` in the `S3CopyToTable` class from the `luigi/contrib/redshift.py` file is failing due to a `TypeError` raised when trying to get the length of `self.columns`, which is `None`.
   
2. The test case `test_s3_copy_with_nonetype_columns` mocks the necessary objects and then calls the `run` method of the `DummyS3CopyToTableKey` task, which eventually triggers the `copy` method with `columns=None`.

3. The error message indicates that the issue stems from trying to get the length of a `NoneType` object (`self.columns`).

4. The GitHub issue mentions that the bug was introduced in Luigi 2.7.1 and proposes a solution to check if `self.columns` is not `None` before trying to get its length.

## Proposed Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug:
- Check if `self.columns` is not `None` before getting its length.
- Update the `if` condition in the `copy` method to prevent the `TypeError`.

## Corrected Version of the Buggy Function

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options())
    )
```

By incorporating the suggested fix of checking if `self.columns` is not `None` before accessing its length, the corrected version of the `copy` method should resolve the `TypeError` issue.
