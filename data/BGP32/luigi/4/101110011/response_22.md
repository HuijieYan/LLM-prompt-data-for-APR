### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `copy` in the `S3CopyToTable` class attempts to check the length of `self.columns`, but it does not handle the case when `self.columns` is `None`. This results in a `TypeError` when trying to call `len(None)`.

### Error Cause:
The bug is caused by the expression `if len(self.columns) > 0:` where `self.columns` is `None` in the failing test case. This leads to the TypeError as mentioned in the GitHub issue.

### Fix Strategy:
To fix this bug, we need to modify the condition to check if `self.columns` is not `None` before calculating its length. This will prevent the `TypeError` when `self.columns` is `None`.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    # Check if self.columns is not None before calculating its length
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

By implementing this corrected version, the `copy` function should now handle the case where `self.columns` is `None` and pass the failing test successfully.
