### Analyzing the buggy function and related information:

- The buggy function `copy` within the `S3CopyToTable` class in `luigi/contrib/redshift.py` is trying to copy data from S3 to Redshift.
- The failing test `test_s3_copy_with_nonetype_columns` in `test/contrib/redshift_test.py` is attempting to run the `copy` function with `columns=None`, triggering a `TypeError`.
- The error message indicates that the issue is caused by trying to get the length of `self.columns`, which is `None`.
- The GitHub issue highlights that passing `columns=None` to prohibit table creation leads to this error.
- The GitHub issue suggests a potential solution to change the condition to `if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0` instead.

### Identifying potential error locations in the buggy function:

- The line causing the issue is `if len(self.columns) > 0:`, where `self.columns` is `None`.
- Attempting to get the length of `None` is triggering the `TypeError`.

### Explanation of the bug:

The bug occurs due to the check for the length of `self.columns` without first verifying that `self.columns` is not `None`. When `columns=None`, the code tries to get the length of `None`, leading to a `TypeError`.

### Suggested strategy for fixing the bug:

To fix the bug, we should modify the condition to first check if `self.columns` is not `None` before trying to get its length. We can use `if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:` as suggested in the GitHub issue.

### Corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

By incorporating the suggested fix into the `copy` function, we ensure that the length of `self.columns` is only checked when `self.columns` is not `None`, thereby resolving the `TypeError` issue when `columns=None`.
