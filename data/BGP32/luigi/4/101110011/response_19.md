### Analysis:
1. The `copy` function in the `S3CopyToTable` class from `luigi/contrib/redshift.py` is attempting to check the length of `self.columns`, but it fails when `self.columns` is `None`, leading to a `TypeError`.
2. The failing test `test_s3_copy_with_nonetype_columns` mocks the necessary objects and tries to run the `DummyS3CopyToTableKey` task, which calls the `copy` function with `columns=None`.
3. The error message shows that the `TypeError` occurs in the `copy` function due to trying to get the length of `None`, which is not allowed.
4. The GitHub issue explains that the bug was introduced in a specific pull request, suggesting a fix in the condition where `self.columns` is checked.
5. A potential fix would be to modify the check for `len(self.columns)` to ensure that `self.columns` is not `None` before checking its length.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
- Update the condition in the `copy` function to first check if `self.columns` is not `None` before checking its length.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options())
    )
```

By incorporating the suggested fix, the code now checks if `self.columns` is not `None` before trying to access its length, resolving the `TypeError` issue.
