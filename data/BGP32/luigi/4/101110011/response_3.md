## Analyzing the buggy function and related issues:

1. The buggy function `copy()` from the `S3CopyToTable` class in `luigi/contrib/redshift.py` is failing due to a `TypeError` when trying to check the length of `self.columns`, which is `None` in this case.
2. The failing test `test_s3_copy_with_nonetype_columns` in `test/contrib/redshift_test.py` is mocking a call to the `copy()` function with `columns=None`, triggering the bug.
3. The error message indicates a `TypeError: object of type 'NoneType' has no len()` at line 338 of `luigi/contrib/redshift.py`.
4. The GitHub issue titled "Redshift COPY fails in luigi 2.7.1 when columns are not provided" provides insight into the root cause and suggests a potential fix by checking `if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:` instead of directly checking the length.

## Suggestions for fixing the bug:
The bug can be fixed by explicitly checking if `self.columns` is not `None` before trying to access its length. This will prevent the `TypeError` when `columns=None`.

## Corrected version of the buggy function:
```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options())
    )
```

By making the modification in the `copy()` function as shown above, the bug should be fixed, and the failing test `test_s3_copy_with_nonetype_columns` should now pass successfully.
