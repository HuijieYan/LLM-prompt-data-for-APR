### Buggy Function Analysis:
1. The `copy` function within the `S3CopyToTable` class in the `luigi/contrib/redshift.py` file is attempting to check the length of `self.columns`, which leads to an error when `self.columns` is `None`.
2. The error occurs within the `copy` function when trying to access the length of `self.columns` due to it being `None`.

### Bug Cause:
The bug occurs because the `copy` function does not handle the case where `self.columns` is `None`, causing a `TypeError` when trying to check the length of `None`.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to modify the condition where the length of `self.columns` is checked. We should first verify that `self.columns` is not `None` before proceeding to check its length. This modification will prevent the `TypeError` from occurring.

### Corrected Version:
```python
    def copy(self, cursor, f):
        """
        Defines copying from s3 into redshift.
    
        If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
        """
        logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
        colnames = ''
        
        if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:  # Check if columns is not None before checking its length
            colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
            colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)
    
        cursor.execute("""
         COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
         CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
         {options}
         ;""".format(
            table=self.table,
            colnames=colnames,
            source=f,
            creds=self._credentials(),
            options=self.copy_options)
        )
``` 

By modifying the condition `if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0`, we ensure that the length of `self.columns` is only checked if `self.columns` is not `None`. This change will prevent the `TypeError` from occurring when `self.columns` is `None`.
