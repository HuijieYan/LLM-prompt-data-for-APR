### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `copy` in the class `S3CopyToTable` is attempting to check the length of `self.columns` without handling the case where `self.columns` is `None`.
2. The failing test `test_s3_copy_with_nonetype_columns` is passing `None` as the `columns` parameter to the `DummyS3CopyToTableKey` instance, triggering the bug.
3. The error message indicates a `TypeError` because the buggy function is trying to retrieve the length of a `NoneType`.
4. The GitHub issue suggests that the bug was introduced in version 2.7.1 of Luigi due to a specific code change.
5. The suggested solution is to check `if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0` to handle the `None` case correctly.

### Fix Strategy:
To resolve the bug, we need to modify the condition in the `copy` function to handle the case where `self.columns` is `None` before checking its length.

### Corrected Version:
```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: luigi/contrib/redshift.py

class S3CopyToTable(rdbms.CopyToTable, _CredentialsMixin):
    def copy_options(self):
        # Implementation not shown for brevity

    def copy(self, cursor, f):
        """
        Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

        If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
        """
        logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
        colnames = ''
        
        if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:  # Check if columns are not None before getting length
            colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
            colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

        cursor.execute("""
         COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
         CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
         {options}
         ;""".format(
            table=self.table,
            colnames=colnames,
            source=f,
            creds=self._credentials(),
            options=self.copy_options())
        )
```

By adding the check `if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0`, we ensure that the bug causing the `TypeError` is fixed. The corrected version should now handle the case where `self.columns` is `None` appropriately.
