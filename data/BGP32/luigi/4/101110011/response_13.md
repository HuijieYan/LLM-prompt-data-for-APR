### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `copy` in the `S3CopyToTable` class attempts to check the length of `self.columns`, which can be `None`. This causes a `TypeError` when trying to apply `len` to a `NoneType`.
2. The failing test `test_s3_copy_with_nonetype_columns` creates an instance of `DummyS3CopyToTableKey` with `columns=None` and then calls the `run` method which invokes the `copy` method in the `S3CopyToTable` class.
3. The failing test provides the error message indicating the exact line causing the issue and the reason behind the failure is explained in the GitHub issue. The bug is related to the validation of `self.columns`.
4. The suggested solution from the GitHub issue is to check if `self.columns` is not `None` before attempting to calculate its length.

### Fix Strategy:
- Modify the buggy line in the `copy` function to include a check for `self.columns` being not `None` before attempting to calculate its length.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns is not None and len(self.columns) > 0:  # Check if self.columns is not None before getting its length
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

By including the check `if self.columns is not None` before checking its length, the corrected version of the function will prevent the `TypeError` caused by trying to apply `len` directly on a `NoneType`. This modification should resolve the issue and pass the failing test.
