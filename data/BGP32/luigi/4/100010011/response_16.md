### Analysis:
The error message indicates that the function is trying to perform a length check on `self.columns`, which is `None`. This situation is causing a `TypeError` when trying to get the length of a `NoneType` object.

### Identification of Error:
The error exists in the line:
```python
if len(self.columns) > 0:
```
The condition `len(self.columns) > 0` assumes `self.columns` to be a list or a similar object, but it is `None`, resulting in a `TypeError`.

### Cause of the Bug:
The bug occurs due to the nature of Python's `NoneType`. The condition `if len(self.columns) > 0` expects `self.columns` to contain a list of columns, but when it is `None`, trying to get the length of `None` results in the mentioned `TypeError`.

### Fix Strategy:
The suggested solution from the GitHub issue is valid and provides a good strategy for fixing the bug. By checking `if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0`, it ensures that the length check is only performed if `self.columns` is not `None`.

### Corrected Version of the Function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:  # Check if columns is not None
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

By modifying the condition to `if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0`, we ensure that the length check is only performed when `self.columns` is not `None`, thus resolving the `TypeError` issue.
