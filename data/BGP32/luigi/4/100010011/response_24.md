### Analysis:
The error occurs at line 338 in the `copy` function where it tries to check the length of `self.columns`, and since `columns` is `None`, it raises a `TypeError` as object of type 'NoneType' has no len().

The issue mentioned on GitHub indicates that this bug was introduced in Luigi 2.7.1. The suggestion to fix this bug is to change the condition to `if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0`, which is an explicit check for `None` before checking the length.

### Fix Strategy:
To fix this bug, we need to modify the condition to explicitly check if `self.columns` is not `None` before trying to get its length. By following the suggestion from the GitHub issue, we can avoid the `TypeError`.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
``` 

By making this change, the corrected version of the `copy` function should now pass the failing test and resolve the issue mentioned on GitHub.
