### Analysis:
The error message indicates a `TypeError` due to trying to get the length of `self.columns`, which is of type `NoneType`. The issue on GitHub also confirms that when `columns` are set to `None`, it causes the `TypeError`.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is caused by the condition `if len(self.columns) > 0:` where it's trying to check the length of `self.columns` without considering that it could be `None`.

### Strategy for Fixing:
To fix the bug, we need to update the condition to explicitly check if `self.columns` is not `None` before getting its length.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:  # Check if columns is not None before getting its length
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

The corrected version includes a check for `self.columns` not being `None` before proceeding to get its length. This change ensures that the bug causing the `TypeError` is fixed.
