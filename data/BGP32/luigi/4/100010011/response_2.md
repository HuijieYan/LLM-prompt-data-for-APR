### Analysis:
The error occurs in the `copy` function when checking the length of the `self.columns` property, which is set to `None`. This causes a `TypeError` when trying to use `len` on a `NoneType` object. The issue in GitHub highlights this problem and suggests a solution to check if `self.columns` is not `None` before proceeding to check its length.

### Bug Cause:
The buggy function fails to handle the scenario where `self.columns` is `None`, resulting in the `TypeError` due to calling `len` on a `NoneType` object.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix this bug, we need to check if `self.columns` is not `None` before trying to access its length. This will prevent the `TypeError` from occurring.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:  # Check if self.columns is not None before accessing its length
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

By adding the check `if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0`, we ensure that the code only tries to access the length of `self.columns` if it's not `None`. This fix addresses the issue reported in the GitHub thread and should now pass the failing test.
