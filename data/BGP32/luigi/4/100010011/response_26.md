### Analysis:
The error occurs in the `copy` function of the `RedshiftTarget` class in the `luigi/contrib/redshift.py` file. The issue arises when trying to fetch the length of `self.columns`, specifically when `self.columns` is `None`. This triggers a `TypeError` because you cannot get the length of a `NoneType` object.

### Bug Cause:
The issue occurs because the code fails to check if `self.columns` is `None` before attempting to get its length. This results in a `TypeError` when `self.columns` is `None`.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to add a check to ensure that `self.columns` is not `None` before trying to get its length. By adding this condition, we can prevent the `TypeError` and make the function more robust.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:  # Check if self.columns is not None before getting its length
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

By adding the check `if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:`, we ensure that the code only proceeds to get the length of `self.columns` if `self.columns` is not `None`. This corrected version should prevent the `TypeError` when `self.columns` is `None` and pass the failing test.
