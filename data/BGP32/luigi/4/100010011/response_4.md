### Analysis:
The error message indicates a `TypeError` occurring in the `copy` function when checking the length of `self.columns`, which is `None`. This issue seems to be related to a recent change in the `luigi` library codebase based on the GitHub issue provided.

### Identified Bug:
The bug occurs due to checking the length of `self.columns` without verifying if it's `None` or not. This change was introduced in a recent pull request and causes the bug when `columns` are set to `None`.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is caused by assuming `self.columns` will always contain a valid list of columns to be used in the query without explicitly handling the case where `self.columns` might be `None`.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we should modify the condition checking the length of `self.columns` to ensure it's not `None` before attempting to get its length.

### Corrected Version:
Below is the corrected version of the `copy` function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:  # Check if self.columns is not None or empty
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)
    
    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

By adding the `if self.columns` condition before checking the length of `self.columns`, we ensure that the code handles the case where `self.columns` might be `None`. This corrected version should resolve the `TypeError` issue reported in the failing test case.
