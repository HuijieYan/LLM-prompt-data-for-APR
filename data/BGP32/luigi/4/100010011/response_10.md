### Analysis:
- The buggy function `copy` in the `luigi/contrib/redshift.py` file is causing an error when `self.columns` is `None`, leading to a `TypeError` due to attempting to get the length of a `NoneType`.
- The error message indicates that the issue arises from line 338 of the `copy` function where it checks the length of `self.columns` without explicitly checking if `self.columns` is not `None`.

### Cause of the Bug:
- The bug occurs because the code does not handle the case where `self.columns` is `None`. It directly tries to get the length of `self.columns` assuming it is not `None`, leading to a `TypeError`.

### Suggested Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
- The suggested strategy is to modify the condition `if len(self.columns) > 0:` to `if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:`. This change ensures that the length of `self.columns` is only checked if `self.columns` is not `None`.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:  # Fixed the condition to handle NoneType
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
``` 

By making this change, the `copy` function will now handle the case where `self.columns` is `None` and should pass the failing test case related to the GitHub issue.
