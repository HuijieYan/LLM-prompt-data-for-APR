### Analysis:
The error message indicates a `TypeError` due to trying to get the length of a `NoneType` object. The issue on GitHub specifies that the bug occurs when `columns` are not provided, causing the function to fail.

### Potential Error Location:
The error is likely occurring in the `copy` method where it checks the length of `self.columns`.

### Cause of the Bug:
The bug occurs because the code does not handle the case when `self.columns` is `None`, causing the TypeError when trying to check its length.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we should update the conditional statement to check if `self.columns` exists and has a length greater than zero before trying to access its length.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

By adding the check `if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:`, we ensure that the code only tries to access the length of `self.columns` when it is not `None`, fixing the bug related to the issue described in GitHub.
