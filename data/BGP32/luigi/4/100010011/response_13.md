### Analysis:
The buggy function `copy` is trying to check the length of `self.columns`, but it does not handle the case where `self.columns` is `None`. This results in a `TypeError` when trying to use `len()` on `None`. The issue described in GitHub suggests that when columns are not provided, the `TypeError` occurs. The proposed solution in the GitHub issue is to modify the condition to explicitly handle the case of `self.columns` being `None`.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is caused by not checking if `self.columns` is `None` before checking its length.

### Fix Strategy:
We need to modify the conditional check related to `self.columns` to explicitly handle the case where `self.columns` is `None`. By doing this, we can avoid the `TypeError` when trying to get the length of `None`.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

By modifying the conditional check as suggested, the corrected function will now handle the case where `self.columns` is `None`, preventing the `TypeError` from occurring.
