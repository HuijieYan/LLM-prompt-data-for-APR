### Analysis:
The buggy function is `copy(self, cursor, f)` from the `luigi/contrib/redshift.py` file. The error occurs when the function tries to check the length of `self.columns`, which is set to `None`. This causes a `TypeError: object of type 'NoneType' has no len()`.

The GitHub issue related to this bug highlights that in luigi 2.7.1, running Redshift COPY jobs with `columns = None` to prevent table creation fails due to this TypeError. The suggested solution is to modify the line to `if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:` to prevent the error.

### Bug Cause:
The bug occurs due to the function trying to find the length (`len`) of `self.columns`, which is `None`. Since `None` is not a sequence type, it raises a TypeError when trying to retrieve its length.

### Proposed Fix:
To fix the bug, we need to update the condition to first check if `self.columns` is not `None` before trying to get its length. This way, we ensure that only non-None values are processed for their length.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
    ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

By making this adjustment in the condition `if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:`, we ensure that the length is only checked for valid sequences and prevent the TypeError when `self.columns` is `None`.
