## Analysis
The error message indicates that the function is trying to calculate the length of `self.columns`, which is `None` in this case, leading to a `TypeError` since `NoneType` does not have a length.

The GitHub issue provides insights into the root cause of the bug. The issue arises when running Redshift COPY jobs with `columns = None` to prevent table creation, causing the bug in luigi 2.7.1.

## Bug Cause
The bug occurs because the function does not handle the case when `self.columns` is `None`. It directly tries to calculate the length of `self.columns` without checking if it is `None` or not.

## Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to modify the conditional check to first verify if `self.columns` is not `None` before calculating its length. This modification will prevent the `TypeError` when `columns` is `None`.

## Corrected Version
Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

By adding the `if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:` check, we ensure that the code only tries to calculate the length of `self.columns` if it is not `None`. This modification addresses the bug reported in the GitHub issue and should now work without causing a `TypeError`.
