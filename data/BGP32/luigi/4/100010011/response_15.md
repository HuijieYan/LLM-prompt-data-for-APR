### Analysis:
The buggy function `copy` in the `redshift.py` file is causing a `TypeError` when trying to check the length of `self.columns`, which is set to `None`. The error message points to the line where the length of `self.columns` is being checked.

According to the GitHub issue, the bug is caused by the change made in a pull request which introduced this bug. The issue is related to handling the case where `columns` is `None`.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is caused by trying to check the length of `self.columns` without checking if `self.columns` is actually present. When `columns` is `None`, the code should not attempt to check its length.

### Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to modify the conditional statement that checks the length of `self.columns` to ensure that it only attempts to check the length when `self.columns` is not `None`.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

By adding the `if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0` check, we ensure that the length of `self.columns` is only evaluated if `self.columns` is not `None`. This correction aligns with the suggestion provided in the GitHub issue, addressing the root cause of the bug.
