### Analysis:
- The buggy function `copy` in `luigi/contrib/redshift.py` is trying to copy data from S3 to Redshift. 
- The error message indicates a `TypeError` due to trying to get the length of `self.columns` when it is `None`.
- The GitHub issue suggests a potential fix by adding an additional condition to check if `self.columns` is not `None` before proceeding to get its length.

### Bug Cause:
- The buggy code is directly trying to get the length of `self.columns` without checking if it is `None` or not.
- This causes an error when `self.columns` is `None`, as it doesn't have a length (object of type 'NoneType').

### Fix Strategy:
- We should modify the if condition to check if `self.columns` is not `None` before proceeding to get its length. This will prevent the `TypeError` when `self.columns` is `None`.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:  # Check if self.columns is not None before getting length
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
``` 

By adding the condition `if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:`, we ensure that we only try to get the length of `self.columns` when it is not `None`. This modification should fix the `TypeError` issue as reported in the GitHub bug.
