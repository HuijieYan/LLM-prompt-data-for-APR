### Analysis:
The issue arises from the buggy function `copy` in the `luigi/contrib/redshift.py` file. The error message indicates a `TypeError` due to attempting to call `len` on a `NoneType` object, specifically when `self.columns` is None.

The GitHub issue related to this bug suggests that the bug is caused by not checking for the existence of `self.columns` before trying to get its length, which leads to the `TypeError`.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is caused by assuming that `self.columns` is always a list and not checking its value before attempting to get its length. When `columns` is set to `None`, the buggy function breaks as it tries to get the length of `None`.

### Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we should first check if `self.columns` is not `None` before attempting to get its length using `len`. This will prevent the `TypeError` when `columns` is `None`.

### Corrected Version:
Here is the corrected version of the `copy` function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:  # Check if self.columns is not None before getting its length
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

By adding the condition `if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0`, we check for the existence of `self.columns` before getting its length. This modification fixes the bug and ensures that the function runs without errors when `columns` is `None`.
