### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `copy` in the `luigi/contrib/redshift.py` file is raising a `TypeError` when `self.columns` is `None` because the buggy code is checking the length of `self.columns` without first verifying if it exists or not.
2. The error message is related to a failing test scenario where the `columns` parameter is `None`.
3. The root cause of the bug is that the buggy code assumes `self.columns` will always exist but does not handle the case when it is `None`. This assumption leads to a `NoneType` error when trying to get the length of `self.columns`.
4. The suggested fix from the GitHub issue is to modify the condition to first check if `self.columns` exists (`if self.columns`) before checking its length. This modification ensures that the code only attempts to get the length of `self.columns` if it is not `None`.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:  # Check if self.columns exists and has elements
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

By making the suggested modification to check if `self.columns` exists before checking its length, the corrected version of the function should be able to handle the scenario where `self.columns` is `None` without raising a `TypeError`.
