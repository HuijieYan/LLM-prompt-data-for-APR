### Analysis:
The buggy function `copy` is failing due to the `TypeError: object of type 'NoneType' has no len()` error. This error occurs when trying to access the `len()` function on a `None` type object in the `if len(self.columns) > 0` condition. The code is assuming that `self.columns` will always be a list, but when it is set to `None`, the error is raised.

Based on the GitHub issue information, the root cause of this bug is due to the code not handling the case where `self.columns` is `None` properly, leading to the error.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to modify the condition `if len(self.columns) > 0` to handle the case where `self.columns` is `None`. The suggested solution from the GitHub issue is to change the line to `if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0`, which will first check if `self.columns` is not `None` before checking its length.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

By incorporating the suggested change, the corrected version of the `copy` function will now handle the case where `self.columns` is `None` and prevent the `TypeError` from occurring. This corrected version should address the bug and resolve the failing test related to the issue reported on GitHub.
