### Analysis:
The buggy function `copy` is trying to check the length of `self.columns` to determine if any columns are provided. However, the bug occurs when `self.columns` is `None`, leading to a `TypeError` when attempting to call `len` on a `NoneType` object. This error is correctly identified in the GitHub issue as mentioned in the description.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is caused by assuming that `self.columns` will always be a list of columns. When `columns` is not provided (equals `None`), the function fails to properly handle this case, resulting in a `TypeError`. 

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to modify the conditional check to properly handle the case when `self.columns` is `None`. The fix should allow for checking if `self.columns` is not None before attempting to get its length.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:  # Check if columns is not None before getting its length
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

By modifying the conditional check in the `copy` function to verify if `self.columns` is not `None`, we can prevent the `TypeError` from occurring when attempting to check the length of `self.columns`. This corrected version should resolve the bug and pass the failing test.
