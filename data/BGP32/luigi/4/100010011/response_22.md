### Analysis:
The buggy function `copy` in the `luigi/contrib/redshift.py` file is causing a `TypeError` when `columns` are set to `None`. The function is trying to check the length of `self.columns` without verifying if `self.columns` is not `None`, leading to the error observed in the failing test case.

### Bug Cause:
The error occurs because the function does not handle the case when `self.columns` is `None`. When `columns` are set to `None`, trying to check the length of `None` causes a `TypeError`.

### Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to modify the condition where we check the length of `self.columns` by adding a nullity check to ensure `self.columns` is not `None` before checking its length.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:  # Add a check for None before getting length
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

By adding the nullity check for `self.columns` in the if condition, we can prevent the `TypeError` from occurring when `columns` are set to `None`. This corrected version should fix the bug and make the function work as expected.
