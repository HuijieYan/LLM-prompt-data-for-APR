### Analysis:
The buggy function `copy` is trying to access the length of `self.columns` without checking if `self.columns` is `None`. This leads to a `TypeError: object of type 'NoneType' has no len()` error when `self.columns` is `None`. The GitHub issue suggests changing the condition to `if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0` to prevent this error.

### Potential Error Location:
The error is likely caused by the line `if len(self.columns) > 0:` where `self.columns` could be `None`.

### Cause of the Bug:
The bug is caused by trying to get the length of a `NoneType` object (`self.columns`) without checking if it is `None`.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to change the condition to `if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0` so that we first check if `self.columns` is not `None` before trying to get its length.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

By making this change, we ensure that we only try to get the length of `self.columns` when it is not `None`, thereby preventing the `TypeError` mentioned in the GitHub issue.
