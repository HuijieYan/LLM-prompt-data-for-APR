### Analysis:
- The buggy function `copy` in `luigi/contrib/redshift.py` is throwing a `TypeError` due to trying to use the `len` function on a `NoneType`.
- The error message shows that the `columns` attribute is `None`, causing the bug when checking its length.
- The GitHub issue suggests that the bug was introduced with the changes made in pull request #2245.

### Bug Cause:
- In the buggy version, the function `copy` does not handle the case when `self.columns` is `None`, leading to a `TypeError` when trying to get the length of `None`.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
- Modify the `if` condition to handle the case when `self.columns` is `None` before checking its length.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)

    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:  # Check if self.columns is not None before getting its length
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

By adding the `if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0` condition, we ensure that the code does not try to get the length of `None`, fixing the bug and resolving the issue mentioned on GitHub.
