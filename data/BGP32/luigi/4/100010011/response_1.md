### Analysis:
The buggy function `copy` is failing due to a `TypeError` caused by attempting to call `len` on a `NoneType` object when checking the length of `self.columns`. This error occurred when trying to copy data from S3 into Redshift without providing any column information (columns = None). This bug is related to the GitHub issue mentioned, where the user pointed out that the code should be modified to handle `self.columns` being `None`.

### Bug Cause:
The bug arises when the `columns` parameter is provided as `None`. The code attempts to check the length of `self.columns` without checking if `self.columns` is not `None` first. This leads to a `TypeError` when trying to get the length of `None`.

### Bug Fix:
To fix the bug, we need to modify the condition to check if `self.columns` is not `None` before checking its length. This will prevent the `TypeError` from occurring.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

By adding the condition `if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:` we ensure that we only attempt to get the length of `self.columns` if it is not `None`. This modification allows the function to handle cases where `columns` is `None` and prevents the `TypeError` from occurring.
