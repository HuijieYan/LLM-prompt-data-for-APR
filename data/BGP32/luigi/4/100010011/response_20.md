### Analysis:
- The buggy function is `copy` from `luigi/contrib/redshift.py`.
- The error message indicates a `TypeError` due to `self.columns` being `None`.
- The GitHub issue points out that running Redshift COPY jobs with `columns = None` fails in Luigi 2.7.1.
- The GitHub issue also suggests a fix to check if `self.columns` is not None before checking its length.

### Bug Cause:
The bug occurs because the code does not check if `self.columns` is `None` before calling `len()` on it. This results in a `TypeError` when trying to get the length of a `NoneType` object.

### Bug Fix:
To fix the bug, we need to modify the line:
```python
if len(self.columns) > 0:
```
to:
```python
if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:
```
This change ensures that `self.columns` is not `None` before checking its length.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:  # Check if self.columns is not None
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

By making this change, the corrected function will now handle the case where `self.columns` is `None` properly, preventing the `TypeError` and resolving the bug.
