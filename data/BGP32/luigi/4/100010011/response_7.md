### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `copy` in the `redshift.py` file of Luigi's codebase is failing due to an error related to `self.columns`, which is set to `None`. This triggers a `TypeError` when trying to check the length of `self.columns`.
2. The error message indicates that an object of type `NoneType` has no length, causing the test to fail.
3. The GitHub issue related to this bug highlights the specific scenario where the `copy` function fails when `columns` is set to `None`. The suggestion in the GitHub issue proposes a possible fix by checking if `self.columns` is not `None` before checking its length.
4. To fix the bug, we should modify the condition to first check if `self.columns` is not `None` before proceeding to check its length.

### Bug Fix:
```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

By adding the check `if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:` before trying to access the length of `self.columns`, we ensure that the function does not throw a `TypeError` when `columns` is set to `None`. This fix addresses the bug and allows the `copy` function to handle the scenario where `columns` is `None`.
