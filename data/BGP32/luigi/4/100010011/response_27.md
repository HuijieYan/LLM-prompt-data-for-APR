### Analysis:
The bug is caused by checking the length of `self.columns` without verifying if it is not `None`. This results in a `TypeError: object of type 'NoneType' has no len()` error when `self.columns` is `None`.

### Bug Cause:
The buggy function `copy` in `luigi/contrib/redshift.py` checks the length of `self.columns` without verifying if it is not `None`. When `self.columns` is `None`, the `len()` function is called on a `NoneType` object, leading to a `TypeError`.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix this bug, we need to modify the condition to check if `self.columns` is not `None` before checking its length. This will prevent the `TypeError` when `self.columns` is `None`.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

By adding the check `if self.columns` before checking the length, we ensure that `len()` is only called when `self.columns` is not `None`. This modification resolves the `TypeError` issue and aligns with the suggested solution in the GitHub issue.
