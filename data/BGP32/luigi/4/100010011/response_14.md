### Analysis:
The error message states that there is a `TypeError` because an object of type 'NoneType' has no length. This occurs when trying to get the length of a NoneType object, which happens when `self.columns` is None in the buggy function.

The GitHub issue indicates that the bug is related to the condition `if len(self.columns) > 0` when `self.columns` is None. The suggested solution is to change the condition to `if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0`.

### Bug Cause:
The buggy function tries to get the length of `self.columns` without checking if it is None or not. When `self.columns` is None, the length cannot be calculated, leading to a `TypeError`.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to modify the condition to first check if `self.columns` is not None before trying to get its length.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

By adding the check `if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:` before trying to get the length of `self.columns`, we prevent the `TypeError` when `self.columns` is None.
