### Analysis:
The buggy function `copy` in the `luigi/contrib/redshift.py` file is causing a `TypeError` when `self.columns` is `None`. The error message and the GitHub issue information suggest that when `columns` are not provided (set to `None`), the function fails due to trying to get the length of a `NoneType` object.

### Identified Bug:
The bug occurs when checking the length of `self.columns` without first verifying if `self.columns` is not `None`. In the buggy function, the condition `if len(self.columns) > 0:` directly attempts to get the length of `self.columns`, resulting in a `TypeError` when `self.columns` is `None`.

### Cause of the Bug:
The root cause of the bug is that the buggy function does not handle the case when `self.columns` is `None`. By attempting to check the length of `None`, the function raises a `TypeError` as `NoneType` object does not have a length.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to modify the condition to first check if `self.columns` is not `None`, and then proceed to check its length. By ensuring that `self.columns` is not `None`, we can avoid the `TypeError` that occurs when trying to get the length of `None`.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:  # Fix: Check if self.columns is not None before checking length
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

By modifying the condition to `if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:`, we ensure that the length of `self.columns` is only checked when `self.columns` is not `None`, addressing the issue highlighted in both the failing test and the GitHub issue. This corrected version should resolve the bug and pass the failing test.
