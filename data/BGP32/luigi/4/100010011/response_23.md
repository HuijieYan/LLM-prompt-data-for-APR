### Analysis:
The error occurs when trying to check the length of `self.columns`, which is None. In the buggy function, the check for the length of `self.columns` is directly done without verifying if `self.columns` is not None. This leads to a `TypeError`.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is caused by not checking if `self.columns` is None before trying to get its length.

### Fix Strategy:
Modify the condition `if len(self.columns) > 0:` to `if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:` to ensure that the length is only checked when `self.columns` is not None.

### Corrected Version:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:  # Check if self.columns is not None
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

By making this change, the corrected version of the function will avoid the `TypeError` when `self.columns` is None, passing the failing test and resolving the issue reported on GitHub.
