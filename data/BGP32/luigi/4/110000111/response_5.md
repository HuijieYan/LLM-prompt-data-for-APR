Based on the provided information, the bug occurs when the `self.columns` attribute is set to `None`, causing a `TypeError` when trying to get its length. To fix this bug, we need to check if `self.columns` is not `None` before attempting to get its length.

Here is the corrected version of the `copy` function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:  # Check if self.columns is not None before getting its length
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

In the corrected version, the `if` condition checks if `self.columns` is not `None` before proceeding to get its length to avoid the `TypeError` that was occurring. This change aligns with the suggested solution in the GitHub issue provided.

This fix ensures that the `copy` function can handle cases where `self.columns` is set to `None` without causing any errors.
