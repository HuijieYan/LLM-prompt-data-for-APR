### Analysis:
The buggy function `copy` in the `S3CopyToTable` class is expecting `self.columns` to be a list and is trying to get the column names from it to construct a query. However, when `self.columns` is `None`, it causes a `TypeError` as it tries to call `len` on a `NoneType`.

### Error Locations:
1. The condition `if len(self.columns) > 0:` assumes `self.columns` is always a list.
2. Not handling the case when `self.columns` is `None`.

### Cause of the Bug:
The bug occurs because the code does not account for the scenario where `self.columns` could be `None`. When `self.columns` is `None`, trying to find the length of `None` results in a `TypeError`.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to first check if `self.columns` is not `None` before trying to access its length. This will prevent the `TypeError` from occurring.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

By adding the condition `if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:` before trying to access the length of `self.columns`, we ensure that the code will only proceed with constructing the query if `self.columns` is not `None`. This correction should prevent the `TypeError` and resolve the issue reported on GitHub.
