### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `copy` within the `S3CopyToTable` class is responsible for inserting a data set into Redshift from S3.
2. The bug occurs when the `self.columns` attribute is not provided, leading to a `TypeError` due to calling `len` on a `NoneType`.
3. The bug originates from the line `if len(self.columns) > 0`, which does not check if `self.columns` is `None` before attempting to get its length.
4. To fix the bug, we need to modify the if condition to `if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0`, ensuring that `self.columns` is not `None` before checking its length.

### Correction:
```python
# The corrected version of the buggy function
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

By making the modification in the if condition to check for the existence of `self.columns` before checking its length, the bug causing the `TypeError` will be resolved. This correction aligns with the suggestion in the GitHub issue titled "Redshift COPY fails in luigi 2.7.1 when columns are not provided".
