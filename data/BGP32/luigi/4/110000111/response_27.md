## Analysis
The buggy function `copy` in the `S3CopyToTable` class defines copying data from s3 into Redshift. The bug arises when `self.columns` is `None`, causing an error due to trying to get the length of a `NoneType`.

## Potential Error Location
The potential error location is the check for the length of `self.columns`. Since there is no explicit check for `None`, it leads to the error when `self.columns` is `None`.

## Cause of the Bug
The bug occurs because when `self.columns` is `None`, the code tries to get the length of `None`, resulting in a `TypeError`. This issue was reported in a GitHub issue where `self.columns = None` case is not handled correctly.

## Strategy for Fixing the Bug
To fix the bug, we need to modify the condition checking the length of `self.columns`. We should first check if `self.columns` is not `None` and then proceed to check its length. This change will prevent the `TypeError` when `self.columns` is `None`.

## Corrected Version
Here is the corrected version of the `copy` function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.
    
    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

This corrected version includes the check for `self.columns` being not `None` before checking its length, addressing the bug reported in the GitHub issue.
