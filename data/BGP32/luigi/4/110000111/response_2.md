Based on the information provided and the GitHub issue, the bug occurs when the `columns` attribute is `None`, resulting in a `TypeError` due to trying to determine the length of `None`. To fix this bug, we need to check if `self.columns` is not `None` before trying to get its length.

Here is a corrected version of the `copy` function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:  # Check if self.columns is not None before getting its length
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

This corrected version includes a check to ensure that `self.columns` is not `None` before trying to retrieve its length. This change addresses the `TypeError` issue reported in the GitHub bug.
