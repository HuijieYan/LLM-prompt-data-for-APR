### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `copy` is responsible for copying data from S3 into Redshift. The issue mentioned on GitHub indicates that when `columns` are set to `None`, the function fails due to a `TypeError`.
2. The potential error location is the condition `if len(self.columns) > 0:` where `self.columns` could be `None`.
3. The bug occurs because when `self.columns` is `None`, attempting to get the length of `None` raises a `TypeError`. The suggested fix on GitHub proposes checking if `self.columns` is not `None` before checking its length.
4. To fix the bug, we will implement the suggested solution by adding a check to ensure `self.columns` is not `None` before accessing its length.
5. Below is the corrected version of the function:

### Corrected Version:
```python
    def copy(self, cursor, f):
        """
        Defines copying from s3 into redshift.
    
        If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
        """
        logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
        colnames = ''
        if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:  # Check if self.columns is not None before getting its length
            colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
            colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)
    
        cursor.execute("""
         COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
         CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
         {options}
         ;""".format(
            table=self.table,
            colnames=colnames,
            source=f,
            creds=self._credentials(),
            options=self.copy_options)
        )
```

By adding the check `if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:`, we ensure that the code will only attempt to get the length of `self.columns` if it is not `None`, resolving the `TypeError` issue when `columns` are not provided in the input.
