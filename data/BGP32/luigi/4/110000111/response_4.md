The bug in the `copy` function arises from the assumption that `self.columns` will always have a value. In cases where `self.columns` is `None`, the bug occurs.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix this bug, we need to check if `self.columns` is not `None` before attempting to perform any operations on it.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

By adding the check `if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:`, we ensure that `self.columns` is not `None` before proceeding with further operations. This correction addresses the issue raised in the GitHub bug report and ensures the function behaves as expected.
