### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `copy` inside the class `S3CopyToTable` is responsible for copying data from S3 to Redshift. The `colnames` variable is created by joining column names if they exist in `self.columns`.
2. The bug occurs when `self.columns` is not provided (set to `None`), resulting in a `TypeError: object of type 'NoneType' has no len()`.
3. The GitHub issue highlights that the bug arises when `columns` are set to `None`, leading to the failure of Redshift COPY jobs.
4. We need to update the condition to check if `self.columns` is not None before trying to get its length.
5. By modifying the condition to `if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0`, we can prevent the bug and ensure the function behaves correctly.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

By implementing this correction, the function will properly handle cases where `self.columns` is set to `None` and avoid the `TypeError` mentioned in the GitHub issue.
