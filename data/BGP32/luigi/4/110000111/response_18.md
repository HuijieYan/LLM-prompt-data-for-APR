### Analysis:
1. The provided buggy function `copy` within the class `S3CopyToTable` is responsible for executing a `COPY` command from an S3 source into a Redshift table.
2. The bug occurs when the `columns` attribute is `None`, leading to a `TypeError: object of type 'NoneType' has no len()`.
3. The cause of the bug is due to the condition `if len(self.columns) > 0:` which fails when `self.columns` is `None`. This issue is highlighted in the GitHub problem statement.
4. To fix the bug, we need to modify the condition to check if `self.columns` exists and then proceed to check its length.
5. The corrected version of the function is provided below.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:  # Check if self.columns exists and then check its length
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

By adding the condition `if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:`, we ensure that the code executes correctly even when `self.columns` is `None`. This correction resolves the `TypeError` issue when `columns` are not provided.
