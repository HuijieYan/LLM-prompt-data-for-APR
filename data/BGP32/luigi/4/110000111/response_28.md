### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `copy` inside the `S3CopyToTable` class in `luigi/contrib/redshift.py` is intended to copy data from s3 to Redshift. The issue arises when `self.columns` is not provided, causing a TypeError due to trying to get the length of a NoneType object.
2. The potential error is located in the line `if len(self.columns) > 0:` where it assumes `self.columns` is always a non-empty list, but it can be None.
3. The bug occurs because when `self.columns` is not provided, it is `None`, and trying to get the length of `None` raises a TypeError. This aligns with the GitHub issue mentioning the same error when `columns = None`.
4. To fix the bug, it is necessary to first check if `self.columns` is not None before trying to get its length. This can be achieved by modifying the condition to `if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:`.
5. Here is the corrected version of the `copy` function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into Redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

By adding the check `if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:`, we ensure that the code will not try to get the length of `self.columns` if it is None, thus fixing the bug mentioned in the GitHub issue.
