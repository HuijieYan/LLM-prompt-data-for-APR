### Analysis:
- The buggy function `copy` within the `S3CopyToTable` class in `luigi/contrib/redshift.py` is causing an issue when trying to execute a Redshift COPY query due to the `self.columns` attribute being `None`.
- The expected input values include `f` as a string, `self` as a `DummyS3CopyToTableKey` instance, `cursor.execute` as a MagicMock object, `cursor` as a MagicMock object, `self.table` as a string, and `self.copy_options` as a string.
- The expected output value of the `colnames` variable at the buggy function's return is an empty string `''`.
- The GitHub issue relates to the bug causing a `TypeError` when `self.columns` is `None`, suggesting a fix to check if `self.columns` exist before checking its length.

### Error:
- The bug occurs when `self.columns` is `None`, causing a `TypeError` when trying to get the length of `None`.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
- Change the check from `if len(self.columns) > 0` to `if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0` to prevent the `TypeError` when `self.columns` is `None`.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from S3 into Redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:  # Check if self.columns is not None before proceeding
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```
