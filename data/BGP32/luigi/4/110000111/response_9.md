### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `copy` in the `S3CopyToTable` class is responsible for inserting a data set into Redshift from S3.
2. The issue reported on GitHub mentions that the bug occurs when `columns` are not provided, resulting in a `TypeError`.
3. The bug seems to be related to the handling of the `self.columns` attribute in the function which leads to the error when it is `None`.
4. To fix the bug, we need to check if `self.columns` is not `None` before trying to access its length.

### Correction:
```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into Redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:  # Check if self.columns is not None before accessing its length
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

By adding the check `if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0`, we ensure that `self.columns` is not `None` before trying to access its length. This change will prevent the `TypeError` that occurs when `columns` are not provided.
