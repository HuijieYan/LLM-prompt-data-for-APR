## Analysis:
1. The buggy function `copy(self, cursor, f)` is part of the `S3CopyToTable` class which is a template task for inserting a dataset into Redshift from s3.
2. The bug seems to be related to how the `columns` attribute is handled in the `copy` function. When `self.columns` is `None`, it causes an error because the code tries to get the length of `None`.
3. The provided GitHub issue mentions that running Redshift COPY jobs with `columns = None` fails due to this bug. The proposed solution in the issue suggests checking if `self.columns` is not None before trying to get its length.
4. To fix the bug, we need to modify the code to check if `self.columns` exists and has a length greater than zero before constructing the `colnames` variable using it.
5. The corrected version of the function is provided below.

## Corrected Version:
```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: luigi/contrib/redshift.py

# The declaration of the class containing the buggy function
class S3CopyToTable(rdbms.CopyToTable, _CredentialsMixin):
    """
    Template task for inserting a data set into Redshift from s3.
    
    Usage:
    
    * Subclass and override the required attributes:
    
      * `host`,
      * `database`,
      * `user`,
      * `password`,
      * `table`,
      * `columns`,
      * `s3_load_path`.
    
    * You can also override the attributes provided by the
      CredentialsMixin if they are not supplied by your
      configuration or environment variables.
    """

    def copy(self, cursor, f):
        """
        Defines copying from s3 into redshift.
    
        If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
        """
        logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
        colnames = ''
        if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:  # Check if self.columns exists and has a length greater than zero
            colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
            colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)
    
        cursor.execute("""
         COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
         CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
         {options}
         ;""".format(
            table=self.table,
            colnames=colnames,
            source=f,
            creds=self._credentials(),
            options=self.copy_options)
        )
```

By adding the `if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0` check before using `self.columns` to construct the `colnames` variable, we ensure that the code does not throw an error when `self.columns` is `None`. This change addresses the bug reported in the GitHub issue and should allow the Redshift COPY jobs to run successfully even when `columns` are not provided.
