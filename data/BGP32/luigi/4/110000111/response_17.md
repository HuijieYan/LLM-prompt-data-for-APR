### Analysis:
The buggy function `copy` in the `S3CopyToTable` class is causing an issue when `self.columns` is set to `None`, resulting in a `TypeError` when trying to get the length of `self.columns`. This issue has been reported on GitHub and a fix has been suggested to check if `self.columns` is not `None` before getting its length.

### Identified potential error location:
- The line causing the issue is: `if len(self.columns) > 0:`

### Cause of the bug:
The bug occurs because the code does not check if `self.columns` is `None` before trying to get its length. When `self.columns` is `None`, the code throws a `TypeError` because you cannot get the length of a `NoneType`.

### Strategy for fixing the bug:
To fix the bug, we need to modify the line that checks the length of `self.columns` to first verify that `self.columns` is not `None`. Only if `self.columns` is not `None`, then we should proceed to check its length.

### Corrected Version:
```python
    def copy(self, cursor, f):
        """
        Defines copying from s3 into redshift.
    
        If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
        """
        logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
        colnames = ''
        if self.columns is not None and len(self.columns) > 0:
            colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
            colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)
    
        cursor.execute("""
         COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
         CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
         {options}
         ;""".format(
            table=self.table,
            colnames=colnames,
            source=f,
            creds=self._credentials(),
            options=self.copy_options)
        )
```

This corrected version first checks if `self.columns` is not `None` before attempting to get its length, avoiding the `TypeError` when `self.columns` is `None`.
