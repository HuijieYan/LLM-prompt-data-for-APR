### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `copy` is responsible for inserting data from an S3 source into a Redshift table.
2. The buggy function attempts to construct a query string for the `COPY` command, including the table name, column names, S3 source location, credentials, and copy options.
3. The bug occurs when the `columns` attribute is not provided, resulting in a `TypeError` due to trying to get the length of a `NoneType`.
4. The suggested fix is to check if `self.columns` is not None before trying to access its length.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
1. Check if `self.columns` is not None before attempting to access its length.
2. Update the condition to `if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0` to avoid the `TypeError`.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

By making the suggested change above, the bug related to the missing handling of `NoneType` while accessing the length of `self.columns` should be resolved. This fix aligns with the proposed solution in the GitHub issue.
