### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `copy` in the `S3CopyToTable` class is meant to copy data from S3 into Redshift. The issue mentioned on GitHub indicates that when `columns` are not provided (set to `None`), it results in a `TypeError`.
2. The potential error location is the check for the length of `self.columns` without verifying if it is `None` or empty.
3. The cause of the bug is that when `self.columns` is `None`, the condition `len(self.columns) > 0` throws a `TypeError` because `NoneType` has no length. This issue is highlighted in the GitHub post.
4. To fix the bug, we need to add a check to ensure that `self.columns` is not `None` before trying to determine its length.
5. Below is the corrected version of the `copy` function:

### Corrected Version:
```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

By adding `self.columns and` to the condition, we ensure that we only try to get the length of `self.columns` when it is not `None`. This change addresses the issue mentioned in the GitHub post.
