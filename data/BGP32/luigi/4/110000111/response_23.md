### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `copy` is part of the `S3CopyToTable` class in the `luigi/contrib/redshift.py` file.
2. The function is responsible for copying data from an S3 source into a Redshift table.
3. The bug occurs when `self.columns` is not provided, resulting in a `TypeError: object of type 'NoneType' has no len()`.
4. The suggested fix is to check if `self.columns` is not None before checking its length.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to modify the condition where the length of `self.columns` is checked. By first verifying that `self.columns` is not None before trying to determine its length, we can avoid the `TypeError` when `self.columns` is not provided.

### Corrected Function:
```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

By adding the condition `if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:` before attempting to process `self.columns`, we ensure that the bug causing the `TypeError` is addressed. This fix aligns with the suggested solution on the GitHub issue.
