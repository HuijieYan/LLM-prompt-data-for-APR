### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `copy` within the `S3CopyToTable` class is responsible for copying data from s3 into Redshift. It has an issue with handling the case when `self.columns` is `None`.
2. The potential error location is in the `if len(self.columns) > 0:` condition where it assumes `self.columns` is always a valid list.
3. The bug occurs when `self.columns` is `None`, causing a `TypeError: object of type 'NoneType' has no len()`. The GitHub issue also confirms this problem.
4. To fix the bug, we need to check if `self.columns` is not `None` before trying to access its length. If it is `None`, then `colnames` should remain an empty string.
5. Here is the corrected version of the `copy` function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

This fix checks if `self.columns` is not `None` before proceeding to extract the column names. This change ensures that the function handles the case when `self.columns` is not provided.
