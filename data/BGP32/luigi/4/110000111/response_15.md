## Analysis:
1. The buggy function `copy` in the `S3CopyToTable` class is responsible for inserting data from S3 into Redshift. It is failing when `self.columns` is None due to the check `len(self.columns) > 0` without checking if `self.columns` is None.
2. The bug is causing a `TypeError: object of type 'NoneType' has no len()` when attempting to get the length of `self.columns`.
3. The GitHub issue suggests modifying the check to `if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0` to avoid the failure when `self.columns` is None.
4. To fix the bug, we need to update the condition to check if `self.columns` is not None before attempting to get its length.

## Bug Fix:
```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: luigi/contrib/redshift.py

# The declaration of the class containing the buggy function
class S3CopyToTable(rdbms.CopyToTable, _CredentialsMixin):
    """
    Template task for inserting a data set into Redshift from s3.
    
    Usage:
    
    * Subclass and override the required attributes:
    
      * `host`,
      * `database`,
      * `user`,
      * `password`,
      * `table`,
      * `columns`,
      * `s3_load_path`.
    
    * You can also override the attributes provided by the
      CredentialsMixin if they are not supplied by your
      configuration or environment variables.
    """

    def copy(self, cursor, f):
        """
        Defines copying from s3 into redshift.
    
        If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
        """
        logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
        colnames = ''
        if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:
            colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
            colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)
    
        cursor.execute("""
         COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
         CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
         {options}
         ;""".format(
            table=self.table,
            colnames=colnames,
            source=f,
            creds=self._credentials(),
            options=self.copy_options)
        )
```

By updating the condition to `if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0`, we avoid the `TypeError` when `self.columns` is None. This correction aligns with the suggestion from the GitHub issue mentioned.
