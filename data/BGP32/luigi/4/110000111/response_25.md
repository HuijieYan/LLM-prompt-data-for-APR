Based on the GitHub issue and the expected input/output values provided, the bug in the `copy` function of the `S3CopyToTable` class arises when `self.columns` is `None`, resulting in a `TypeError` when trying to get the length of `None`. To fix this bug, we need to check if `self.columns` is not `None` before trying to get its length.

Here is the corrected version of the `copy` function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)
    else:
        colnames = ''
    
    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

With this correction, we check if `self.columns` is not `None` before trying to get its length. If `self.columns` is `None`, we set `colnames` to an empty string, preventing the `TypeError` from occurring when trying to access the length of `None`.
