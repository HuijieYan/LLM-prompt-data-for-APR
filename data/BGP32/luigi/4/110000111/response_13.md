## Analysis
The buggy function `copy` in the `S3CopyToTable` class is failing when the `columns` attribute is not provided or set to `None`. The issue originates from trying to get the length of `self.columns` without checking if it is `None` first. This results in a `NoneType` error when trying to get the length of `None`.

## Error Location
The error is occurring in the line:
```python
if len(self.columns) > 0:
```

## Cause of the Bug
The bug is caused by assuming that `self.columns` will always have a value and attempting to get its length without checking if it is `None`. The GitHub issue provides information about the root cause and suggests a fix by checking if `self.columns` is not `None` before getting its length.

## Strategy for Fixing the Bug
To fix the bug, we need to modify the line that checks the length of `self.columns`. We should check if `self.columns` is not `None` before attempting to get its length. This way, the code will handle the case where `self.columns` is not provided gracefully.

## Corrected Version
```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:  # Check if columns is not None before getting its length
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

By adding the condition `if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0`, we ensure that the length of `self.columns` is only accessed when it is not `None`. This modification addresses the bug described in the GitHub issue and prevents the TypeError from occurring when `columns` is not provided.
