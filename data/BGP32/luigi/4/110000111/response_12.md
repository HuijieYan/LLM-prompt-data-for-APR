### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `copy` in the `S3CopyToTable` class is responsible for copying data from S3 to Redshift. The bug occurs when `self.columns` is `None`, leading to a `TypeError` due to trying to get the length of a `NoneType` object.
2. The error location is the check for the length of `self.columns`.
3. The bug is caused by not checking if `self.columns` is `None` before trying to get its length. The GitHub issue suggests modifying the condition to handle the case where `self.columns` is `None`.
4. To fix the bug, we need to modify the condition to check if `self.columns` exists and is not `None` before getting its length.
5. Below is the corrected version of the `copy` function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
``` 

This revised version includes a check for `self.columns` before attempting to get its length to prevent the `TypeError` when `self.columns` is `None`.
