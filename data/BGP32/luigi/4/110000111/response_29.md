### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `copy` within the `S3CopyToTable` class in the `redshift.py` file is causing issues when `self.columns` is not provided, resulting in a `TypeError`.
2. The function is attempting to construct a string `colnames` by iterating over `self.columns` without checking if it is `None`, which leads to the error.
3. The cause of the bug is that when `self.columns` is `None`, the function still tries to iterate over it, resulting in a `TypeError`. The GitHub issue suggests adding a check to ensure `self.columns` is not `None`.
4. To fix the bug, we should check if `self.columns` is not `None` before constructing the string `colnames`.
5. Below is the corrected version of the `copy` function:

### Corrected Version:
```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns is not None and len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

By adding the check `self.columns is not None` before trying to access the length of `self.columns`, we prevent the `TypeError` that was occurring when `self.columns` is `None`. This change addresses the bug reported in the GitHub issue and ensures that the function behaves correctly in cases where `self.columns` is not provided.
