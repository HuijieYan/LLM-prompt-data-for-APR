### Analysis:
The buggy function `copy` in `luigi/contrib/redshift.py` is causing issues when `self.columns` is `None`. The problem arises from trying to get the length of `self.columns` without checking if it's `None` first. This bug is linked to GitHub issue #2245, where the user reported that Redshift COPY jobs fail when columns are not provided due to a `TypeError: object of type 'NoneType' has no len()` error.

### Error Locations:
The potential error location in the buggy function is the line:
```python
if len(self.columns) > 0:
```
which directly tries to get the length of `self.columns` without checking if it's `None` first.

### Cause of the Bug:
The bug occurs because when `self.columns` is `None`, attempting to get its length with `len(self.columns)` results in a `TypeError`. The bug was acknowledged in the GitHub issue, as the original code was not handling the case where `self.columns` is `None`.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, a check should be added to verify if `self.columns` is not `None` before attempting to get its length. This ensures that the code only proceeds to get the length if `self.columns` is not `None`. Following the suggestion in the GitHub issue, we should change the line to:
```python
if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:
```

### Corrected Version:
```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

By incorporating the suggested check in the corrected version of the `copy` function, the bug related to Redshift COPY jobs failing when columns are not provided in Luigi 2.7.1 should be resolved.
