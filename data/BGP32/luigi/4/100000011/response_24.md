### Analysis:
The buggy function `copy(self, cursor, f)` is related to the GitHub issue titled "Redshift COPY fails in luigi 2.7.1 when columns are not provided." The issue describes that running Redshift COPY jobs with `columns = None` to avoid table creation fails due to a `TypeError: object of type 'NoneType' has no len()` error. The error is related to the check for the length of `self.columns` when it is `None`.

### Potential Error Locations:
1. The `if len(self.columns) > 0` condition is causing the `TypeError` when `self.columns` is `None`.
2. The function tries to get the column names from `self.columns` without checking if it is `None`.

### Cause of the Bug:
The bug occurs because the function does not handle the case where `self.columns` is `None`. As a result, when `self.columns` is `None`, the code attempts to get the length of `None`, resulting in the `TypeError`.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, the function should check if `self.columns` is not `None` before trying to get the length of it. Adjusting the conditional statement to check for both conditions will prevent the `TypeError` and allow the function to handle the case where `self.columns` is `None` gracefully.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

By updating the conditional statement to `if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0`, the bug is fixed, and the function will now handle the case where `self.columns` is `None` without causing a `TypeError`.
