### Analysis:
The buggy function `copy` in the `luigi/contrib/redshift.py` file is causing an issue related to Redshift COPY jobs failing when columns are not provided. The problem seems to be related to the handling of the `self.columns` attribute within the `copy` function.

### Potential Error Locations:
The potential error location in the buggy function is the following line:
```python
if len(self.columns) > 0:
```

### Cause of the Bug:
The bug is caused by the way the function checks the length of `self.columns`. When `self.columns` is `None`, calling `len()` on it results in a `TypeError` since `NoneType` has no length.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that we first check if `self.columns` is not `None` before attempting to get its length. This will prevent the `TypeError` when `self.columns` is `None`.

### Corrected Version:
Here is the corrected version of the `copy` function:
```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from S3 into Redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

By adding the check `if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:`, we ensure that the length of `self.columns` is only checked when it is not `None`, thus resolving the issue mentioned in the GitHub problem statement.
