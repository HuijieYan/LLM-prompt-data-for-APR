### Analysis:
The buggy function `copy` in the `luigi/contrib/redshift.py` file is causing issues when running Redshift COPY jobs with columns set to `None`. The problem arises from attempting to get the length of columns when it is `None`, leading to a `TypeError`.

### Error Location:
The potential error location is in the line:
```python
if len(self.columns) > 0:
```

### Cause of the Bug:
The bug is caused because the buggy function assumes that `self.columns` will always have a value, leading to an error when it is `None`. This issue is related to the GitHub problem described, where `columns = None` is meant to indicate no columns for table creation, but the buggy function does not handle this case properly.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that we only try to get the length of `self.columns` if it exists and is not `None`. By updating the condition to first check if `self.columns` is not `None` before checking its length, we can prevent the `TypeError` from occurring.

### Corrected Version:
```python
# Corrected version of the buggy function
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:  # Check if self.columns is not None before getting its length
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

By making this adjustment to the condition, the buggy function will now handle the case where `self.columns` is `None` properly and prevent the `TypeError` from occurring when running Redshift COPY jobs without specifying columns.
