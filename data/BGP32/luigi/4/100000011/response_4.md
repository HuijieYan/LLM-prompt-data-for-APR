### Analysis:
The buggy function `copy` in the `redshift.py` file of Luigi is causing an issue when the `self.columns` attribute is None. This issue is related to the GitHub issue titled "Redshift COPY fails in luigi 2.7.1 when columns are not provided." The error occurs due to the attempt to get the length of `self.columns` without checking if it is None.

### Identified Error:
The error occurs in this line:
```python
if len(self.columns) > 0:
```
The issue arises when `self.columns` is None, causing a `TypeError`.

### Cause of the Bug:
The bug is caused by directly calling `len(self.columns)` without validating if `self.columns` is not None. In the case when `columns = None` is explicitly used to prohibit table creation, the buggy function fails to handle this scenario gracefully.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix this bug, we need to first check if `self.columns` is not None before trying to get its length. By adding a condition to verify if `self.columns` exists, we can prevent the `TypeError` when it is None.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:  # Check if self.columns is not None
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

By adding the condition `if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:`, we ensure that the code inside the if block is only executed when `self.columns` is not None. This corrected version prevents the `TypeError` issue mentioned in the GitHub post.
