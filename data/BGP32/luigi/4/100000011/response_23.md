### Analysis:
The buggy function `copy` is responsible for copying data from S3 into Redshift. The issue reported on GitHub indicates that when running Redshift COPY jobs with `columns = None` to prevent table creation, it fails in Luigi 2.7.1 due to a `TypeError: object of type 'NoneType' has no len()` error. The cause of this bug can be traced to the line that checks the length of `self.columns` without validating if it is `None`.

### Identified Error:
The error occurs when `self.columns` is `None` and the length is checked without verifying its existence.

### Bug Cause:
The buggy code attempts to compute the length of `self.columns` without confirming that it's not `None`. This leads to a `TypeError` when trying to operate on a `NoneType`.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
The proposed solution is to add a check for the existence of `self.columns` before checking its length to ensure that `None` values are properly handled and to avoid the `TypeError`.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from S3 into Redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

By adding a check for `self.columns` before the length evaluation, the corrected version of the function ensures that the `TypeError` due to operating on a `NoneType` is resolved, addressing the issue reported on GitHub.
