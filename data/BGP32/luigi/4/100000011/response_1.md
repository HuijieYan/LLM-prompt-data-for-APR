### Analysis:
The buggy function is the `copy` function from the `redshift.py` file in the `luigi/contrib` directory. The function is responsible for copying data from S3 into Redshift. The issue reported on GitHub mentions that when `self.columns` is set to `None` to prohibit table creation, the function fails with a `TypeError: object of type 'NoneType' has no len()` error.

### Potential Error Locations:
The error is likely occurring in the following line of code:
```python
if len(self.columns) > 0:
```
When `self.columns` is `None`, the `len` function cannot be applied to it, resulting in a `TypeError`.

### Cause of the Bug:
The bug occurs because the function does not handle the scenario where `self.columns` is set to `None`, which leads to the `TypeError`. The proposed solution on GitHub suggests checking if `self.columns` is not `None` before checking its length.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to modify the condition to explicitly check if `self.columns` is not `None` before checking its length.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:  # check if self.columns is not None
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

With this modification, the function will first check if `self.columns` is not `None` before attempting to get its length, addressing the issue reported on GitHub.
