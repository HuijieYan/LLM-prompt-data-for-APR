### Analysis:
The buggy function `copy` in the `luigi/contrib/redshift.py` file is being used to define the logic for copying data from S3 into Redshift. The issue reported on GitHub indicates that when the `columns` attribute is set to `None` to prevent table creation, the function fails with a `TypeError`.

### Potential Error Locations:
1. The usage of `len` on `self.columns`.
2. The condition `if len(self.columns) > 0` assuming `self.columns` always has a value.

### Cause of the Bug:
The bug occurs because the function is not handling the case when `self.columns` is `None`. When `self.columns` is set to `None`, a `TypeError` is raised when trying to get the length of `None`.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to modify the condition checking the length of `self.columns` by first ensuring that `self.columns` is not `None`. This will prevent the `TypeError` when `self.columns` is set to `None`.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from S3 into Redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

In the corrected version, the condition `if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:` ensures that `self.columns` is not `None` before checking its length. This modification addresses the bug reported on GitHub and prevents the `TypeError` when `self.columns` is set to `None`.
