### Analyzing the buggy function:

The buggy function `copy` in the `luigi/contrib/redshift.py` file is responsible for copying data from S3 into Redshift. The issue reported on GitHub indicates that the function fails when the `columns` attribute is not provided, resulting in a `TypeError: object of type 'NoneType' has no len()` error.

### Potential error locations:
- The line `colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])` where it assumes `self.columns` is always available.
- The condition `if len(self.columns) > 0` without checking if `self.columns` is None.


### Cause of the bug:
The bug occurs because the code assumes `self.columns` to be always present and valid for constructing the `colnames` string. When `self.columns` is None (i.e., not provided), the function attempts to call `len(self.columns)` which leads to the `TypeError`.

### Fixing strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to modify the code to handle the case when `self.columns` is not provided. We should first check if `self.columns` is not None before trying to access its length. If `self.columns` is None, we can proceed without constructing the `colnames` string.

### Corrected version of the function:
Here is the corrected version of the `copy` function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

In this corrected version, we first check if `self.columns` is not None before constructing the `colnames` string. This modification ensures that the function works correctly even when `self.columns` is not provided.
