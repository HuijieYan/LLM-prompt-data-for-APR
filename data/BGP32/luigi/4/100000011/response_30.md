### Analyzing the buggy function and its relationship with the GitHub issue:

The buggy function `copy` in the `luigi/contrib/redshift.py` file is causing an issue when the `columns` attribute is not provided. The function is attempting to iterate over the columns to generate the `colnames` variable, but if `self.columns` is None, it results in a `TypeError`.

The GitHub issue titled "Redshift COPY fails in luigi 2.7.1 when columns are not provided" describes this exact problem and proposes a solution to check whether `self.columns` is `None` before attempting to get its length.

### Potential error locations within the buggy function:
1. The `colnames` generation logic assumes that `self.columns` is not `None`.
2. If `self.columns` is `None`, it results in a `TypeError` when trying to get the length of `None`.

### Cause of the bug using the buggy function and GitHub Issue information:
The bug occurs when the `self.columns` attribute is not provided, leading to a `TypeError` when attempting to generate the `colnames` string. The root cause lies in the assumption that `self.columns` will always have a value, as seen in the fix proposed in the GitHub issue.

### Strategy for fixing the bug:
To fix the bug, we need to check if `self.columns` is `None` before attempting to generate the `colnames` string. This will prevent the `TypeError` when `self.columns` is not provided.

### Corrected version of the function:
```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from S3 into Redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:  # Added a check for None before getting length
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

### Summary:
The corrected version of the `copy` function includes a check for `None` before getting the length of `self.columns`, addressing the issue described in the GitHub problem. This fix ensures that the function does not encounter a `TypeError` when `self.columns` is not provided.
