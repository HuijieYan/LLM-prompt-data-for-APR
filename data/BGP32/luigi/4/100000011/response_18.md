### Analysis:
1. The buggy function is the `copy` method within the `redshift.py` file in the `luigi.contrib` module. This method is responsible for defining the copying process from S3 into Redshift.
2. The bug seems to stem from the `if` condition checking the length of `self.columns`, where if the columns are not provided, it results in a `NoneType` error.
3. The GitHub issue indicates that when `columns` are set to `None` intentionally to prevent table creation, the bug occurs due to the `len` function being called on a `NoneType` object.
4. To fix the bug, we need to adjust the `if` condition to handle cases where `self.columns` is `None` gracefully.
5. The solution proposed in the GitHub issue suggests modifying the `if` condition to explicitly check if `self.columns` is not `None` before checking its length.

### Updated Function:
```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

By modifying the `if` condition to check whether `self.columns` is not `None` before proceeding with the `len` check, we ensure that the code handles cases where `columns` are intentionally set to `None`. This correction aligns with the suggested solution on the GitHub issue and should resolve the error encountered during Redshift COPY operations in Luigi 2.7.1.
