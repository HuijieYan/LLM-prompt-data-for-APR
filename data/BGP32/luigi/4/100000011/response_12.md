## Analysis:
The buggy function `copy` from `luigi/contrib/redshift.py` is failing to handle the case where `self.columns` is None. This leads to a `TypeError` due to attempting to get the length of a `NoneType`. The issue mentioned on GitHub suggests a fix by checking if `self.columns` is not None before checking its length.

## Potential Error Location:
The potential error location in the buggy function is when trying to calculate the length of `self.columns` without checking if it is None.

## Cause of the Bug:
The root cause of the bug is due to the assumption that `self.columns` will always have a list of columns. When `self.columns` is set to `None` intentionally to prohibit table creation, the function fails to handle this case and raises a `TypeError` when trying to get the length of `NoneType`.

## Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to modify the condition that checks the length of `self.columns` to first check if it is not None before calculating the length. This change will ensure that the code handles the case where `self.columns` is None correctly.

## Corrected Version:
```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:  # Check if self.columns is not None before getting its length
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

By making this change, the `copy` function will now correctly handle the case where `self.columns` is set to `None` and avoid the `TypeError` mentioned in the GitHub issue.
