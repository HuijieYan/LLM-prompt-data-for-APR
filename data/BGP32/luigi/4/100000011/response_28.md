### Analysis:
The buggy function `copy` in the `luigi/contrib/redshift.py` file is failing when the `columns` attribute is set to `None`. This issue is linked to a GitHub issue where it has been reported that Redshift `COPY` jobs fail in Luigi 2.7.1 when `columns` are not provided, resulting in a `TypeError` due to `NoneType` not having a length.

### Potential Error Locations:
The potential error location in the buggy function is the following line:
```python
if len(self.columns) > 0:
```

### Cause of the Bug:
The bug occurs because when `columns` is `None`, it is not valid to check its length directly. This results in a `TypeError` since `NoneType` does not have a length attribute.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix this bug, we need to modify the condition where the length of `self.columns` is checked. The check should first verify that `self.columns` is not `None` before proceeding to check its length.

### Corrected Version:
Here is the corrected version of the `copy` function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

In this corrected version, we added a check `if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:` before attempting to access the length of `self.columns`. This will prevent the `TypeError` when `columns` is `None`.
