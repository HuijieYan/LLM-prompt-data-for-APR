## Analysis:
The buggy function `copy` in the `redshift.py` file within the Luigi library is causing an issue when the `columns` attribute is not provided, resulting in a `TypeError`. The GitHub issue points out that the bug is triggered when trying to run Redshift COPY jobs with `columns = None`.

## Potential Error Locations:
1. The condition `if len(self.columns) > 0` assumes that `self.columns` is always a valid list.
2. The GitHub issue suggests that the bug may lie in this conditional check.

## Cause of the Bug:
The bug occurs because the buggy function does not handle the case when `self.columns` is `None`. The function assumes that `self.columns` will always be a list and tries to access the length of `self.columns` without checking if it exists or not.

## Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug and resolve the GitHub issue, we need to modify the code to first check if `self.columns` exists and then proceed to check its length. This will prevent the `TypeError` when `self.columns` is `None`.

## Corrected Version:
```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: luigi/contrib/redshift.py

# Corrected version of the copy function
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from S3 into Redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:  # Fix for handling NoneType
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

By modifying the conditional check to `if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0`, we ensure that the code will only attempt to access the length of `self.columns` when it is not `None`. This correction addresses the bug reported in the GitHub issue and resolves the `TypeError` when running Redshift COPY jobs with `columns = None`.
