## Analysis:
The buggy function `copy` is a method within the `Redshift` class in the `redshift.py` file of the `luigi.contrib` module. The function is responsible for defining copying operations from S3 into Redshift. The issue described on GitHub indicates that when the `columns` attribute is None, the function fails with a `TypeError` due to trying to get the length of a NoneType object.

## Error Locations:
The potential error location within the buggy function is the following line:
```python
if len(self.columns) > 0:
```
If `self.columns` is None, this line will cause a `TypeError`.

## Bug Cause:
The root cause of the bug is that the code assumes `self.columns` will always be non-empty before checking its length. When `columns` is explicitly set to None to prevent table creation, the check for `len(self.columns)` before confirming if `self.columns` is not None causes the function to fail.

## Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to adjust the condition to first check if `self.columns` is not None before trying to get its length. This way, we avoid the `TypeError` when `columns` is explicitly set to None.

## Corrected Version:
Here is the corrected version of the `copy` function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

In this corrected version, we have added the condition `if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:` to ensure that we only try to get the length of `self.columns` when it is not None. This change should resolve the issue described in the GitHub report.
