## Analysis:
The buggy function `copy` in the `redshift.py` file from `luigi/contrib` is attempting to copy data from S3 into Redshift. The issue reported on GitHub indicates that when `self.columns` is set to `None` to prohibit table creation, the function fails with a `TypeError` due to the attempted operation `len(self.columns)` on a `NoneType` object. The suggested fix in the GitHub issue proposes to check if `self.columns` is not `None` before checking its length.

## Identified Errors:
1. Attempting to get the length of `self.columns` without explicitly checking if it is not `None`.
2. Missing check for `self.columns` before trying to get its length.

## Cause of the Bug:
The root cause of the bug is that the function does not handle the case when `self.columns` is `None`. The function assumes that `self.columns` is always a valid list, leading to a `TypeError` when trying to get its length.

## Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To address the bug, we need to modify the condition `if len(self.columns) > 0` to first check if `self.columns` is not `None` before checking its length. This modification will prevent the `TypeError` from occurring when `self.columns` is set to `None`.

## Corrected Version:
```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from S3 into Redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} FROM '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

In the corrected version, the `if` statement now includes a check to ensure that `self.columns` is not `None` before trying to get its length. This change will prevent the `TypeError` described in the GitHub issue and improve the robustness of the function.
