## Analysis:
The buggy function `copy` is related to the GitHub issue titled "Redshift COPY fails in luigi 2.7.1 when columns are not provided". The issue states that running Redshift COPY jobs with `columns = None` to prevent table creation fails in luigi 2.7.1 with a `TypeError` due to `object of type 'NoneType' has no len()`.

## Error Locations:
1. The buggy function checks the length of `self.columns` without validating if `self.columns` is `None`.
2. When `self.columns` is `None`, `len(self.columns)` throws an exception, leading to the `TypeError`.

## Cause of Bug:
The bug occurs because the function does not check if `self.columns` is `None` before trying to access its length. This leads to a `TypeError` when trying to use `len()` on `None`, as mentioned in the GitHub issue.

## Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that `self.columns` is not `None` before attempting to check its length. We can modify the line that checks the length of `self.columns` to include an additional check for `self.columns` being not `None`.

## Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

By adding the conditional check `if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:` before attempting to access the length of `self.columns`, we ensure that the function does not throw a `TypeError` when `self.columns` is `None`. This correction addresses the issue reported in the GitHub bug.
