## Analysis:
The buggy function `copy` in the `luigi/contrib/redshift.py` file is causing an issue when the `columns` attribute is None. The issue occurs due to the line `if len(self.columns) > 0:` where it tries to get the length of `self.columns` without checking if it is None, leading to a `TypeError` if `self.columns` is None.

## Error Locations:
1. The line `if len(self.columns) > 0:` - It does not check if `self.columns` is None before trying to get its length.

## Cause of the Bug:
The bug is caused by not handling the case where `self.columns` is None. This leads to a `TypeError` when trying to get the length of `None`.

## Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to check if `self.columns` is not None before taking its length. This will prevent the `TypeError` when `self.columns` is None.

## Corrected Version:
```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

In the corrected version, I have added a check `if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:` to ensure that `self.columns` is not None before trying to get its length. This change will fix the issue reported in the GitHub bug report.
