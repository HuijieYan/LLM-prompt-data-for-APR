### Analyzing the buggy function and its relationship with the GitHub issue:
The buggy function `copy` in the `luigi/contrib/redshift.py` file is responsible for copying data from S3 to Redshift. The issue mentioned in GitHub describes a situation where providing `columns = None` to prohibit table creation causes the `TypeError: object of type 'NoneType' has no len()` error in Luigi 2.7.1. The root cause seems to be related to the check for the length of `self.columns` without verifying if `self.columns` is not `None`.

### Potential error locations within the buggy function:
The error seems to be related to the following line:
```python
if len(self.columns) > 0:
```
This line assumes `self.columns` is not `None` before checking its length. This can lead to the `TypeError` when `self.columns` is actually `None`.

### Cause of the bug using the buggy function and the GitHub Issue information:
The bug is caused by directly trying to get the length of `self.columns` without first verifying that `self.columns` is not `None`. When `self.columns` is `None`, the function throws a `TypeError` because `NoneType` does not have a `len()` method.

### Strategy for fixing the bug:
The suggested fix is to first check if `self.columns` is not `None` before checking its length. This ensures that the code does not attempt to get the length of `None`.

### Corrected version of the function:
```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from S3 into Redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

By adding the check `if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:`, we ensure that the code only tries to get the length of `self.columns` if `self.columns` is not `None`. This correction addresses the root cause of the bug reported in the GitHub issue related to Redshift COPY failures in Luigi 2.7.1 when columns are not provided.
