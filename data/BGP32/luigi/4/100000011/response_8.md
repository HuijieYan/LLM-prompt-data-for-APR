## Analysis:
The buggy function `copy` in `luigi/contrib/redshift.py` is attempting to execute a Redshift COPY command without handling the case when `self.columns` is `None`. This leads to a `TypeError` when trying to get the length of a `NoneType` object.

## Error Location:
The potential error location is in the `if len(self.columns) > 0:` line, where it assumes `self.columns` is always a valid list.

## Cause of the Bug:
The bug occurs because the function does not account for the scenario when `self.columns` is `None`. This issue arises when trying to determine the length of `self.columns` when it is `None`, resulting in a `TypeError`.

## Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we should first check if `self.columns` exists and is not `None` before attempting to get its length. This will avoid the `TypeError` when `self.columns` is not provided.

## Corrected Version:
```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from S3 into Redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    if self.columns is None:
        colnames = ''

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

In the corrected version, I have added a check `if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:` to ensure that `self.columns` is not `None` before trying to get its length. Additionally, I have included a check for `None` to set `colnames` to an empty string when `self.columns` is `None`. This approach addresses the bug by handling the case when `self.columns` is not provided.
