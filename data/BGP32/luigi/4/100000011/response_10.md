## Analysis:
The buggy function `copy` in the `luigi/contrib/redshift.py` file is causing an issue when trying to run Redshift COPY jobs without providing any columns. This issue is related to a GitHub bug where the `TypeError: object of type 'NoneType' has no len()` error occurs when `self.columns` is None.

## Error Locations:
The potential error location in the buggy function is the check on the length of `self.columns` without verifying if it is None or not before accessing its length.

## Cause of the Bug:
The bug is caused by assuming that `self.columns` will always have a value before checking its length. When `self.columns` is None, the bug triggers the `TypeError` since Python does not allow getting the length of a `NoneType` object.

## Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to add a check to verify if `self.columns` is not None before trying to access its length. By doing this, we avoid the `TypeError` when `self.columns` is None.

## Corrected Version:
```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.
    
    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:  # Added a check for NoneType here
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

By including the check `if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:` in the corrected version, we prevent the `TypeError` from occurring when `self.columns` is None. This fix aligns with the suggested solution in the GitHub issue, resolving the bug related to Redshift COPY jobs in luigi 2.7.1.
