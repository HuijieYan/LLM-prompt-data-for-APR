## Analysis:
The buggy function `copy` is a part of the `luigi.contrib.redshift` module. The issue described on GitHub indicates that running Redshift COPY jobs with `columns = None` to prevent table creation fails in luigi 2.7.1 due to a `TypeError: object of type 'NoneType' has no len()` error. The issue seems to be related to a check for the length of `self.columns` without properly handling the case when `self.columns` is `None`.

## Potential Error Locations:
The error is most likely occurring at the line `if len(self.columns) > 0:` where `self.columns` might be `None`.

## Bug Cause:
The bug is caused by not handling the case when `self.columns` is `None`. When `self.columns` is `None`, trying to access its length with `len()` results in a `TypeError`. This issue was identified and discussed in the GitHub issue provided.

## Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to modify the condition `if len(self.columns) > 0:` to handle the case when `self.columns` is `None`. By checking if `self.columns` is not `None` before getting its length, we can avoid the `TypeError` when `self.columns` is `None`.

## Corrected Version:
```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

In the corrected version, the condition `if self.columns:` is used to check if `self.columns` is not `None` before proceeding with getting its length. This change ensures that the bug causing the `TypeError` is fixed by handling the case where `self.columns` is `None`.
