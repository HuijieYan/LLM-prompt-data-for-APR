### Analysis:
The buggy function `copy` in the `luigi/contrib/redshift.py` file is causing a TypeError when the `self.columns` attribute is None. This issue corresponds to a GitHub issue titled "Redshift COPY fails in luigi 2.7.1 when columns are not provided", where the root cause of the problem is identified as a check for the length of `self.columns` without verifying if it exists.

### Potential error locations:
The potential error location in the buggy function is the line `if len(self.columns) > 0:` where it assumes `self.columns` is always a valid list.

### Cause of the bug:
The bug is caused by a failing assumption that `self.columns` will always be a valid list, leading to a TypeError when it is None. This issue prevents Redshift COPY jobs from running when columns are not provided explicitly.

### Strategy for fixing the bug:
To fix the bug, we need to check if `self.columns` exists and is a valid list before checking its length. This will prevent the TypeError when `self.columns` is None.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

In the corrected version, we added a check `if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:` before processing the column names. This change ensures that the code will only try to access the length of `self.columns` if it is not None, addressing the root cause of the bug mentioned in the GitHub issue.
