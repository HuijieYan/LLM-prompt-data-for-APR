### Analysis:
The buggy function is the `copy` function within the `redshift.py` file in the `luigi/contrib` directory. The function is responsible for copying data from S3 into Redshift. The bug seems to occur when the `self.columns` attribute is not provided, leading to a `TypeError` because the code tries to get the length of a `NoneType`.

### Identified Error Location:
The potential error location within the buggy function is when trying to get the length of `self.columns` without first checking if `self.columns` is not `None`.

### Cause of the Bug:
The root cause of the bug is that the code does not check if `self.columns` is `None` before trying to get its length. This triggers a `TypeError` when `self.columns` is `None` which can happen when no columns are provided explicitly when invoking the function.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to modify the conditional check for the existence of `self.columns` before trying to extract its length. By adding a check if `self.columns` exists and is not `None` before checking its length, we can prevent the `TypeError` from occurring when columns are not provided explicitly.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from S3 into Redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:  # Check if self.columns exists and is not None
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

By making this modification to the `copy` function, we ensure that the code checks if `self.columns` exists and is not `None` before proceeding to access its length. This correction aligns with the suggested solution in the GitHub issue and should resolve the `TypeError` when columns are not provided explicitly.
