### Analysis:
The buggy function `copy` in the `luigi/contrib/redshift.py` file is causing an issue when `self.columns` is not provided, resulting in a `TypeError` due to attempting to get the length of a `NoneType`.

### Potential Error Locations:
The potential error locations in the buggy function are where the length of `self.columns` is checked. If `self.columns` is not provided, it will be `None`, leading to the `TypeError`.

### Cause of the Bug:
The bug is caused by the assumption that `self.columns` will always have a value. When `self.columns` is not provided (i.e., `None`), the code fails to handle this case and tries to access the length of `None`, resulting in a `TypeError`.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to check if `self.columns` is not `None` before attempting to access its length. By adding a condition to check the existence of `self.columns` before checking its length, we can prevent the `TypeError` when `self.columns` is not provided.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:  # Check if self.columns is not None before getting its length
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

By making this small adjustment in the code to check the existence of `self.columns` before getting its length, we are addressing the root cause of the bug reported in the GitHub issue. This correction will prevent the `TypeError` when `self.columns` is not provided.
