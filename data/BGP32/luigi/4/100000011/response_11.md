### Analysis:
The buggy function `copy` in `luigi/contrib/redshift.py` is causing an issue where Redshift COPY jobs fail when columns are not provided. The specific error mentioned in the GitHub issue is `TypeError: object of type 'NoneType' has no len()`, which occurs due to trying to get the length of `self.columns` when it is None.

### Potential Error Locations:
1. The `if len(self.columns) > 0:` condition is directly checking the length of `self.columns`, which can lead to the mentioned error if `self.columns` is None.
2. The `colnames` string concatenation based on `self.columns` might also cause issues if `self.columns` is None.
3. The handling of `self.columns` in the function might not account for cases when it is not provided.

### Cause of the Bug:
The bug arises because the function does not handle the scenario where `self.columns` is not provided. When `self.columns` is None, trying to access its length with `len(self.columns)` results in a TypeError. This issue is linked to a specific code change mentioned in the GitHub issue.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug and address the GitHub issue, we need to modify the conditional check on `self.columns` to ensure it is not None before attempting to get its length. By updating the condition to `if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:`, we can prevent the TypeError and handle cases where `self.columns` is None.

### Corrected Version:
```python
# Corrected version of the buggy function
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:  # Check if self.columns is not None before accessing its length
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

By making this adjustment in the `copy` function, we ensure that the issue described in the GitHub bug report is addressed, and Redshift COPY jobs will not fail when columns are not provided.
