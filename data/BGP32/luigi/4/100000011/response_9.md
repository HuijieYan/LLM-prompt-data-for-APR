### Analysis:
The buggy function `copy` in the `luigi/contrib/redshift.py` file is causing an issue when trying to run Redshift COPY jobs with columns set to None. The bug results in a `TypeError: object of type 'NoneType' has no len()` error due to the `len(self.columns)` check in the function. This issue is related to GitHub issue #2245, where the root cause was identified.

### Potential Error Locations:
The potential error location is the `len(self.columns)` check when `self.columns` is None.

### Cause of the Bug:
The bug occurs because the buggy function does not handle the case where `self.columns` is None. When columns are not provided (set to None), the `len(self.columns)` check throws a TypeError as NoneType object has no length.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to modify the condition where the length of `self.columns` is checked. We can update the condition to check if `self.columns` is not None before checking its length.

### Corrected Version:
```python
# The corrected version of the function
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:  # Check if self.columns is not None before checking its length
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

By updating the condition to check if `self.columns` is not None before checking its length, we ensure that the function handles the case where columns are not provided correctly. This correction addresses the bug reported in the GitHub issue related to Redshift COPY failures in Luigi 2.7.1 when columns are not provided.
