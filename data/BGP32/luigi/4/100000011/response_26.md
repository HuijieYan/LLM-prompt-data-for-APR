### Analysis:
The buggy function `copy` in the `redshift.py` file is supposed to define copying data from S3 into Redshift. The issue reported on GitHub mentions that when `columns` are not provided (i.e., `columns = None`), the Redshift COPY operation fails with a `TypeError` due to the attempt to get the length of `None`.

### Error Locations:
1. The buggy function attempts to get the length of `self.columns` without checking if it is `None`.
2. The `if len(self.columns) > 0` condition is causing the issue when `self.columns` is `None`.

### Cause of the Bug:
The bug occurs because `self.columns` is not explicitly handled when it is `None`. The function assumes `self.columns` will always have a value, leading to the `TypeError` when trying to get its length.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we should check if `self.columns` is not `None` before attempting to get its length. By adding a condition to ensure that `self.columns` is not `None` before proceeding, we can prevent the `TypeError`.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from S3 into Redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:  # Check if self.columns is not None before getting its length
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

By incorporating the `if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:` condition, we ensure that `self.columns` is not `None` before trying to access its length. This correction addresses the bug reported on GitHub related to Redshift COPY failures when columns are not provided.
