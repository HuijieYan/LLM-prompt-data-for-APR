### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `copy` is attempting to check the length of `self.columns`, which is an optional parameter. When `columns` is `None`, this check causes a `TypeError`.
2. The error message specifically mentions that an object of type `NoneType` has no length.
3. The GitHub issue indicates that this bug is related to a recent change in the code where `self.columns` can be `None`, causing the failure.
4. The suggested strategy for fixing the bug is to first check if `self.columns` is not `None` before checking its length.

### Correction:
```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.
    
    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

By adding `if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0`, we ensure that the length check is only performed when `self.columns` is not `None`. This correction addresses the bug and aligns with the suggested fix in the GitHub issue.
