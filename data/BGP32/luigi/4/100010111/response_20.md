### Analysis
The buggy function `copy` is failing due to the `TypeError: object of type 'NoneType' has no len()` error. This error occurs because the columns parameter is None, which leads to an attempt to check the length of a NoneType object.

### Bug
The bug occurs in the line:
```python
if len(self.columns) > 0:
```
where `self.columns` is None, causing the TypeError.

### Fix Strategy
We need to modify the condition to first check if `self.columns` is not None before trying to get its length. This will prevent the TypeError and handle the case when columns are not provided properly.

### Corrected Version
Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

This corrected version includes the modification in the condition to first check if `self.columns` is not None before proceeding to get its length, avoiding the TypeError.
