### Analysis:
- The error is caused by trying to call `len()` on a `NoneType` object in the buggy function.
- The function is expecting a list of columns, but when `columns` is `None`, it fails to handle it properly.
- The error message clearly states the issue: `TypeError: object of type 'NoneType' has no len()`.
- The expected behavior is to gracefully handle the case when `columns` is `None`.
- The suggested solution in the GitHub issue is to change the condition to `if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0`.

### Fix Strategy:
- Update the conditional check to handle the case when `self.columns` is `None`.
- Modify the condition to first check if `self.columns` is not `None` before checking its length.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from S3 into Redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:  # Updated condition to handle NoneType
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options};
    """.format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

By making this change, the function will now properly handle the case when `self.columns` is `None`, preventing the `TypeError` and resolving the issue reported on GitHub.
