### Analysis
The error occurs because the `self.columns` attribute is `None`, and the code is trying to call `len()` on a `NoneType` object, resulting in a `TypeError`. The suggested solution from the GitHub issue indicates that we can check if `self.columns` is not `None` before attempting to get its length.

### Fix
To fix this issue, we will modify the if condition to `if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0`. This change will ensure that the code does not try to get the length of a `None` object.

### Corrected Function
```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
``` 

By making this change, the corrected function should now handle the case where `self.columns` is `None` without throwing a `TypeError` and address the issue identified in the GitHub report.
