### Analysis:
1. The error message indicates a `TypeError: object of type 'NoneType' has no len()`, specifically occurring in the line `if len(self.columns) > 0`.
2. The function attempts to extract column names but does not handle the case where `self.columns` is `None`.
3. The bug is causing the function to raise an error when `self.columns` is `None`, which was not handled properly. This issue is also reported in a GitHub issue about Redshift COPY jobs failing when columns are not provided.
4. To fix the bug, we need to check if `self.columns` is not `None` before trying to get its length.

### Correction:
Here is the corrected version of the function incorporating the fix:

```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: luigi/contrib/redshift.py

def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.
    
    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:  # Fix: Check if self.columns is not None before getting length
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

By adding the condition `if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0`, we ensure that the function only tries to extract column names when `self.columns` is not `None`. This correction should resolve the `TypeError` during the function execution.
