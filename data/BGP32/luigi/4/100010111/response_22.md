### Bug Analysis:
The error message indicates a `TypeError: object of type 'NoneType' has no len()` occurring at line 338 due to attempting to call `len(self.columns)` where `self.columns` is `None`. The function is expecting `self.columns` to be a list, but in the failing test `columns` is set to `None`, causing the bug.

### Bug Explanation:
The bug occurs because the function assumes `self.columns` will be a list and attempts to get its length without checking if it's `None` first. The failing test wants to pass `columns=None` to test a scenario without specifying columns, causing the function to break since it expects a list.

### Bug Fix:
To fix the bug, we need to check if `self.columns` is not `None` before trying to get its length. This ensures that the code doesn't break in cases where columns are not provided explicitly.

### Corrected Function:
```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: luigi/contrib/redshift.py

# This is the corrected function
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

By adding `if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:` before trying to access the length of `self.columns`, we ensure that the code won't break if `columns` is `None`. This correction will allow the function to handle cases where columns are not explicitly provided.
