### Analysis:
The error occurs because the condition `if len(self.columns) > 0:` is directly trying to access the `len()` function on `None` type, leading to a `TypeError` when `self.columns` is `None`.

### Bug Cause:
The buggy function fails when the `columns` attribute is `None`, as it tries to check the length of `None` directly. This leads to a `TypeError` since `None` does not have a length.

### Fix Strategy:
To resolve this issue, we need to modify the condition to first check if `self.columns` is not `None` before trying to access its length. This will prevent the `TypeError` and allow the function to proceed with the correct logic.

### Corrected Function:
```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns is not None and len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

By adding the condition `if self.columns is not None` before checking its length, we ensure that the function does not throw a `TypeError` when `columns` is `None`. This correction allows the function to proceed correctly in cases where `columns` is not provided.
