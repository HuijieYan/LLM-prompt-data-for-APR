## Analysis
The error message indicates a `TypeError` where an object of type `NoneType` has no length. This error occurs in the `copy` function when trying to check the length of `self.columns`. The function expects `self.columns` to be a list of columns, but in the failing test case, it is set to `None`.

The GitHub issue provides a solution suggesting to change the line that checks the length of `self.columns` to also include a check for `self.columns` being not `None`.

## Bug Explanation
In the buggy function, the condition `if len(self.columns) > 0:` is directly trying to get the length of `self.columns` without checking if `self.columns` is `None`. When `self.columns` is `None`, it leads to the `TypeError` mentioned in the error message.

## Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to add an extra check to ensure that `self.columns` is not `None` before attempting to get its length.

## The Corrected Function
```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

By adding `if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:` we ensure that we only proceed with obtaining the length of `self.columns` if it is not `None`. This change should fix the bug and allow the function to execute correctly in cases where `self.columns` are `None`.
