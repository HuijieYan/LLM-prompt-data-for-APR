### Analysis:
The buggy function `copy` is failing due to the `TypeError: object of type 'NoneType' has no len()`. This error is occurring when trying to check the length of `self.columns` where `self.columns` is assigned as `None`.

The expected input values are a string `f`, an instance of `DummyS3CopyToTableKey` for `self`, a `MagicMock` object for `cursor.execute` and `cursor`, string values for `self.table` and `self.copy_options`, and `None` for `self.columns`.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is caused by the `if len(self.columns) > 0` line in the `copy` function where it is trying to check the length of `self.columns` directly without first checking if `self.columns` is not `None`. This leads to the mentioned `TypeError`.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to first check if `self.columns` is not `None` before attempting to get its length. This can be done by changing the conditional statement to `if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0`. This will ensure that the length is only checked if `self.columns` is not `None`.

### Corrected Version:

```python
import logging

logger = logging.getLogger('luigi-interface')

def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

By making this change, the corrected version of the function will avoid the `TypeError` by first verifying that `self.columns` is not `None` before checking its length. This change aligns with the suggested fix in the GitHub issue as well.
