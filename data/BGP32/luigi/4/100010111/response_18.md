## Analysis:
The error message indicates a `TypeError` caused by trying to get the length of a `NoneType` object. This occurs when the `self.columns` attribute is `None` and the code attempts to check its length.

## Bug:
The bug happens when `self.columns` is `None`, causing the code to fail when checking its length.

## Fix:
To fix this issue, we can modify the if condition to explicitly handle the case when `self.columns` is `None` before checking its length.

## Corrected Version:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

This corrected version includes a check for `self.columns` to ensure it is not `None` before attempting to get its length. This fix should resolve the `TypeError` caused by a `NoneType` object.
