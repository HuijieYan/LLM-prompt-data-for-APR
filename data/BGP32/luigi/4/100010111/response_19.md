### Analysis
The error message indicates a `TypeError` occurring due to the `len(self.columns)` operation when `self.columns` is `None`. The function is trying to retrieve the length of `self.columns` without handling the case where it might be `None`. 

### Bug Cause
The bug is caused because the function does not check if `self.columns` is `None` before trying to retrieve its length using `len()`. This issue was identified in the GitHub issue mentioned, indicating that when `columns` is provided as `None`, the code breaks.

### Fix Strategy
To fix this bug, we need to check if `self.columns` is not `None` before trying to access its length. This way, we ensure that we only call `len()` on a non-`None` object.

### Corrected Version

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns is not None and len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

In this corrected version, the code checks if `self.columns` is not `None` before attempting to get its length. This modification ensures that the code will not break when `columns` is provided as `None`.
