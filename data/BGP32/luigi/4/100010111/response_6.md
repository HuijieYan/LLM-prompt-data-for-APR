### Analysis:
- **Error Message**: The error message indicates a `TypeError` due to trying to get the length of a `NoneType` object.
- **Expected Input/Output**: The function is expected to correctly handle the case where `self.columns` is `None`, in which case it should not attempt to get the length of `None`.
- **GitHub Issue**: The issue points out that the error occurs when `columns = None`, and suggests a solution to check if `self.columns` is not None before getting its length.

### Identified Bug:
The bug occurs when `self.columns` is `None`, but the code does not handle this case and directly tries to get the length of `self.columns`.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we should check if `self.columns` is not `None` before trying to get its length.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

This corrected version includes the check `if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0` to ensure that `self.columns` is not `None` before attempting to get its length. This modification resolves the `TypeError` issue when `self.columns` is `None`.
