### Analysis
The error message indicates a `TypeError` due to trying to get the length of a `NoneType` object in the `copy` function. This occurs when the `self.columns` attribute is `None` which leads to an empty `colnames` variable. This issue matches a reported GitHub issue related to Redshift `COPY` jobs failing when columns are not provided.

### Bug Cause
The bug occurs because the code does not check if `self.columns` is `None` before trying to get its length. This causes the `TypeError` when attempting to check `len(self.columns)`.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix this bug, we need to check if `self.columns` is not `None` before attempting to get its length in order to prevent the `TypeError`.

### Corrected Function

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns is not None and len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

With this correction, the function will now correctly handle cases where `self.columns` is `None`. It checks if `self.columns` is not `None` before attempting to get its length, ensuring that the `TypeError` is avoided and the function behaves as expected.
