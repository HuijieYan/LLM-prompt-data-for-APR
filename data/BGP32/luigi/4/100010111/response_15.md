### Analysis
The error occurs due to checking the length of `self.columns` without verifying if it is not `None`. The `columns` parameter is expected to be a list of tuples, but when it is assigned as `None`, the buggy function fails to handle this case.

### Bug Explanation
The bug arises because the code directly checks the length of `self.columns` without validating if it is not `None`. This leads to a `TypeError: object of type 'NoneType' has no len()` when trying to check the length of a `NoneType` object.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix this bug, we need to ensure that before checking the length of `self.columns`, we first verify that `self.columns` is not `None`. This can be achieved by adding a simple conditional check before accessing the length.

### Corrected Code
```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.
    
    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:  # Added None check
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

By adding the `if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:` check, we ensure that the code only attempts to find the length of `self.columns` when it is not `None`. This modification resolves the issue by handling the scenario where `columns` is `None`.
