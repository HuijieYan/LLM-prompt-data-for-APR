### Analysis
1. The error message indicates a `TypeError` due to trying to get the length of a `NoneType` object.
2. The function `copy` is checking the length of `self.columns` without first verifying if it is not `None`.
3. The expected input values are a file path (`f`), a `DummyS3CopyToTableKey` object (`self`), and mock objects for `cursor` and `cursor.execute`.
4. The suggested fix is to check if `self.columns` is not `None` before checking its length.

### Correction

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns is not None and len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

With this correction, the function first checks if `self.columns` is not `None` before attempting to determine its length. This change prevents the `TypeError` encountered when `self.columns` is `None`.
