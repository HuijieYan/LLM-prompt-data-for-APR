## Analysis
The error message indicates a `TypeError` due to trying to get the length of a `NoneType` object. This occurs because the code doesn't handle cases where `self.columns` is `None`. The expected behavior is to check if `self.columns` is not `None` before proceeding with further operations.

## Bug in the Code
The bug in the code lies in the line `if len(self.columns) > 0:`. If `self.columns` is `None`, an error will occur when trying to get the length of `None`.

## Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to first check if `self.columns` is not `None` before attempting to get its length.

## Updated Corrected Function
```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns is not None and len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

By adding the check `if self.columns is not None and len(self.columns) > 0:`, we ensure that only when `self.columns` is not `None` do we proceed with getting its length and performing further operations. This fix addresses the issue of trying to get the length of a `NoneType` object.
