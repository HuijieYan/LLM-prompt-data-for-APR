### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `copy` is trying to check the length of `self.columns` without handling the case where `self.columns` might be `None`.
2. The error message indicates a `TypeError` caused by trying to get the length of a `NoneType` object.
3. The expected input for `columns` is `None`, and the function is expected to handle this case gracefully without causing a `TypeError`.
4. The suggested strategy is to modify the condition to check if `self.columns` is not `None` before attempting to get its length.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns is not None and len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

By making the modification to check if `self.columns` is not `None` before checking its length, the corrected version of the function will handle the case of `columns` being `None` without causing a `TypeError`. This fix should resolve the issue reported on GitHub as well.
