## Analysis
- The buggy function `copy` is trying to check the length of `self.columns` which is causing an error when `self.columns` is `None`.
- The error message points to a `TypeError: object of type 'NoneType' has no len()`.
- Based on the GitHub issue, the problem arises when `columns` is set to `None` to prevent table creation.
- The proposed solution in the GitHub issue suggests checking `if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0`.

## Bug Cause
- The bug is caused by directly checking the length of `self.columns` without considering the case when it is `None`.

## Strategy for Fixing the Bug
- Modify the conditional check to consider both the existence of `self.columns` and its length to avoid the error when `self.columns` is `None`.

## Corrected Version of the Function
```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:  # Check if self.columns is not None before checking its length
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

By making this change, the corrected function will not attempt to check the length of `self.columns` when it is `None`, thus resolving the `TypeError` that occurred.
