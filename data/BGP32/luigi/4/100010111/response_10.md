### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `copy` is failing due to a `TypeError` being raised when `self.columns` is `None` and the function is trying to check its length.
2. The function is attempting to construct a SQL query for copying data from S3 to Redshift, however, it is not handling the case when `self.columns` is `None`.
3. The cause of the bug is the function not checking if `self.columns` is `None` before trying to access its length. This causes a `TypeError` when `len(self.columns)` is called.
4. To fix the bug, we need to add a check to ensure that `self.columns` is not `None` before trying to access its length. This will prevent the `TypeError` from being raised.

### Bug Fix:
```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

By adding the `if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:` check, we ensure that `self.columns` is not `None` before trying to access its length. This prevents the `TypeError` from occurring and fixes the bug.
