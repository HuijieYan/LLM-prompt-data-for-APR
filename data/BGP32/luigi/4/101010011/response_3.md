### Analysis:
1. The buggy function is `copy` inside the `S3CopyToTable` class in the `luigi/contrib/redshift.py` file.
2. The error message indicates a `TypeError` due to trying to get the length of `self.columns` when it is `None`.
3. The cause of the bug is that when `columns=None` is passed to the `DummyS3CopyToTableKey` object, the condition `if len(self.columns) > 0:` fails because `self.columns` is `None`. This is related to the GitHub issue where it is mentioned that passing `columns=None` to prohibit table creation results in the error.
4. To fix the bug, we need to check if `self.columns` is not `None` before trying to get its length.
5. The correction involves ensuring that `self.columns` is not `None` before checking its length in the `copy` function.

### Corrected Version:
```python
class S3CopyToTable(rdbms.CopyToTable, _CredentialsMixin):
    def copy(self, cursor, f):
        """
        Defines copying from s3 into redshift.
    
        If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
        """
        logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
        colnames = ''
        if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:
            colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
            colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)
    
        cursor.execute("""
         COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
         CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
         {options}
         ;""".format(
            table=self.table,
            colnames=colnames,
            source=f,
            creds=self._credentials(),
            options=self.copy_options())
        )
```

By adding the condition `if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:` before trying to access the length of `self.columns`, we ensure that `self.columns` is not `None` before proceeding. This correction should resolve the `TypeError` issue mentioned in the failing test and the corresponding GitHub issue.
