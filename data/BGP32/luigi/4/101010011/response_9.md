### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `copy` in the `S3CopyToTable` class is trying to check the length of `self.columns`, but it's not handling the case where `self.columns` is `None`, which leads to a `TypeError`.
2. The related function `copy_options` doesn't directly impact the bug.
3. The error message indicates a `TypeError` caused by trying to get the length of a `NoneType` object.
4. To fix the bug, we need to handle the case where `self.columns` is `None` before checking its length.
5. The suggested fix is to add a condition to check if `self.columns` is not `None` before checking its length to avoid the `TypeError`.

### Bug Fix:
```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:  # Fix for handling NoneType
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options())
    )
```

By incorporating the suggested fix, the bug should be resolved, and the corrected function should now handle the case where `self.columns` is `None` without causing a `TypeError`.
