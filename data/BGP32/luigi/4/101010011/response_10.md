### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `copy` within the `S3CopyToTable` class is trying to check the length of `self.columns` without verifying if it exists. This leads to a `TypeError` when `self.columns` is `None`.
2. The error occurs because `self.columns` is not properly handled when it is `None` in line 338.
3. The corresponding GitHub issue (#2245) explains that explicitly checking if `self.columns` exists before checking its length would resolve the issue.

### Bug Cause:
The bug occurs because the code does not check if `self.columns` is `None` before trying to get its length. When `self.columns` is `None`, an attempt to get the length results in a `TypeError`.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to modify the code to first check if `self.columns` exists before proceeding to check its length. This will prevent the `TypeError` when `self.columns` is `None`.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.
    
    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:  # Check 'self.columns' exists and has elements
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)
    
    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

By adding the condition `if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:`, we ensure that the program only attempts to get the length of `self.columns` if it actually exists and is not `None`. This corrected version should resolve the bug and pass the failing test.
