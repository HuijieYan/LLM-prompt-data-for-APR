### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `copy` within the `S3CopyToTable` class in the file `luigi/contrib/redshift.py` is trying to check the length of `self.columns`. 
2. The error occurs when `self.columns` is `None`, leading to a `TypeError: object of type 'NoneType' has no len()`.
3. The GitHub issue specifies that the issue arises when trying to run Redshift COPY jobs with `columns = None` to prevent table creation, and provides a possible fix by modifying the conditional statement.
4. The bug can be resolved by checking if `self.columns` is not None before checking its length, as suggested in the GitHub issue.

### Solution:
To fix the bug, we need to update the conditional statement in the `copy` function to handle the case where `self.columns` is `None`.

### Corrected Version:
```python
# The corrected version of the buggy function
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:  # Check if self.columns is not None before checking its length
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options())
    )
```

By implementing this change in the `copy` function, the bug that causes a `TypeError` when `self.columns` is `None` will be fixed.
