### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `copy` in the `S3CopyToTable` class is attempting to check the length of `self.columns`, but when `columns` is passed as `None` it leads to a `TypeError`.
2. The error message indicates that the issue is with the line `if len(self.columns) > 0:` trying to operate on a `NoneType`.
3. The GitHub issue points out that the bug was introduced in version 2.7.1 of Luigi due to a specific change in the code. The suggestion in the GitHub issue is to modify the condition to `if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:` to avoid the `TypeError`.
4. To fix the bug, we should modify the condition check to handle the case where `self.columns` is `None`.
5. The corrected version of the function is provided below.

### Proposed Fix:
```python
# The corrected version of the buggy function
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:  # Check if self.columns is not None before checking its length
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options())
    )
```

By adding the check `if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:`, we ensure that the code does not try to operate on `NoneType`, avoiding the `TypeError` when `columns` is `None`.
