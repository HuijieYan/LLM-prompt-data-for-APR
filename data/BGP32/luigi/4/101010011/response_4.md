## Analysis:
1. The `copy` function in the `S3CopyToTable` class is trying to access the length of `self.columns`, which is causing a `TypeError` when `self.columns` is `None`.
2. The error message indicates that the `object of type 'NoneType' has no len()`, which means `self.columns` is None.
3. The GitHub issue confirms that this bug occurs when `columns = None` is passed to prohibit table creation, and the bug was introduced in luigi 2.7.1.
4. The suggestion from the GitHub issue is to modify the condition to `if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0` to handle the case where `self.columns` is None.

## Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Modify the condition to safely check if `self.columns` is not None before trying to access its length.

## Corrected Version:
```python
    def copy(self, cursor, f):
        """
        Defines copying from s3 into redshift.
    
        If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
        """
        logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
        colnames = ''
        if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:  # Check if self.columns is not None before trying to access its length
            colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
            colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

        cursor.execute("""
         COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
         CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
         {options}
         ;""".format(
            table=self.table,
            colnames=colnames,
            source=f,
            creds=self._credentials(),
            options=self.copy_options())
        )
``` 

In the corrected version, the condition for checking the length of `self.columns` involves checking if `self.columns` is not None first. This modification ensures that the function does not try to access the length of a NoneType object, addressing the TypeError.
