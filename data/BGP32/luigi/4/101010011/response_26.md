Based on the information provided, the bug occurs due to the comparison of `self.columns` against `None` in the buggy function `copy`. The error message indicates that the comparison `if len(self.columns) > 0:` is causing the `TypeError` because `self.columns` is `None`, resulting in `NoneType` having no length.

To fix the bug, we need to check if `self.columns` is not `None` before trying to access its length. Additionally, the suggested solution from the GitHub issue is to modify the comparison to `if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:` which ensures that the length is only checked when `self.columns` is not `None`.

Here is the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options())
    )
```

By making this change, the corrected version of the function should now properly handle cases where `self.columns` is `None`, avoiding the `TypeError` and resolving the issue reported in the GitHub.
