Based on the error message and the GitHub issue, the bug is caused because the `self.columns` attribute is None, and the buggy function is directly checking for its length without first verifying if it is not None.

To fix the bug, we need to check if `self.columns` is not None before checking its length. If it is None, we should handle it appropriately to avoid the TypeError.

Here is the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

In this corrected version, we check if `self.columns` is not None before attempting to get its length. This fix will prevent the TypeError when `self.columns` is None and will resolve the issue mentioned in the GitHub report.

By making this change, the corrected function should now pass the failing test and behave as expected when `self.columns` is None.
