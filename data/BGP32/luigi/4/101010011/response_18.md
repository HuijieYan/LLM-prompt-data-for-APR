### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `copy` within the `S3CopyToTable` class is attempting to check the length of `self.columns` which is causing a `TypeError` when `self.columns` is `None`.
2. The error message indicates that the problem is coming from line 338 of the `redshift.py` file where the length of `self.columns` is checked.
3. The root cause of the bug lies in the fact that when `self.columns` is `None`, the code is not handling this case properly. This issue was reported on GitHub and a suggested fix has been provided.
4. To fix the bug, we need to modify the check for the length of `self.columns` to also explicitly check if `self.columns` is not `None` before attempting to get its length.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
- Modify the line `if len(self.columns) > 0:` to `if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:` to ensure that the length is only checked if `self.columns` is not `None`.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options())
    )
```

By making this change, the corrected version of the function should now handle the case when `self.columns` is `None` without causing a `TypeError`. This fix aligns with the suggested solution provided in the GitHub issue.
