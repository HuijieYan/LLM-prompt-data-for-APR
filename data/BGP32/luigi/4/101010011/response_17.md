### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `copy` within the `S3CopyToTable` class in `luigi/contrib/redshift.py` is causing a `TypeError` when trying to get the length of `self.columns` when it is `None`.
2. The related function `copy_options` sets up some copy-related options but does not directly affect the error.
3. The error message indicates that an object of type `NoneType` has no length, which occurs due to trying to call `len` on `self.columns` when it is `None`. The GitHub issue highlights the specific problem related to `self.columns` being `None`.
4. To fix the bug, we need to check if `self.columns` is not `None` before trying to get its length.
5. The suggested fix is to change the condition from `if len(self.columns) > 0` to `if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0`.

### Correction:
```python
# The declaration of the class containing the corrected copy function
class S3CopyToTable(rdbms.CopyToTable, _CredentialsMixin):
    # This function from the same class is called by the corrected function
    def copy_options(self):
        # Please ignore the body of this function


    # The corrected copy function
    def copy(self, cursor, f):
        """
        Defines copying from s3 into redshift.
    
        If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
        """
        logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
        colnames = ''
        if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:  # Check if self.columns is not None
            colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
            colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

        cursor.execute("""
         COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
         CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
         {options}
         ;""".format(
            table=self.table,
            colnames=colnames,
            source=f,
            creds=self._credentials(),
            options=self.copy_options)
        )
```

By incorporating the suggested fix and ensuring that `self.columns` is checked for `None` before attempting to get its length, the corrected version of the function should address the `TypeError` issue highlighted in the test failure. This should resolve the problem reported in the GitHub issue as well.
