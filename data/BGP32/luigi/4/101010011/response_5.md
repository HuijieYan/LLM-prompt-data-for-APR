### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `copy` is trying to check the length of `self.columns`, but in the failing test case, `columns` is set to `None`, causing a `TypeError`.
2. The related function `copy_options` is called within the `copy` function but doesn't seem to be the cause of the bug.
3. The error message clearly indicates that the issue arises when trying to check the length of `self.columns`, which is `None`.
4. To fix the bug, we should modify the condition to check if `self.columns` is not `None` before checking its length.

### Bug Cause:
The buggy function is trying to check the length of `self.columns` without verifying if it is not `None`. This leads to a `TypeError` when `self.columns` is `None`.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
Modify the condition in the `copy` function to check if `self.columns` is not `None` before checking its length.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:  # Check if self.columns is not None before checking its length
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

By adding the condition `if self.columns` before checking the length, we ensure that only non-None values of `self.columns` are processed, thus fixing the bug identified in the failing test.
