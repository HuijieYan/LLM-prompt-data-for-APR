### Analysis:
1. **Buggy Function**: The `copy` function in the `S3CopyToTable` class is causing an error when `self.columns` is `None`.
   
2. **Related Function**: The `copy_options()` function is supposed to provide additional copy options but is not directly related to the bug.
   
3. **Error Message**: The error occurs when trying to check the length of `self.columns`, which is `NoneType`.
   
4. **GitHub Issue**: The GitHub issue suggests that the bug is related to trying to get the length of `self.columns` when it can be `None`. The suggestion is to modify the condition to check if `self.columns` exists before checking its length to fix the issue.
   
### Bug Cause:
The bug occurs because the `copy` function directly checks the length of `self.columns` without first checking if it is `None`, leading to a `TypeError` when `self.columns` is `None`.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to modify the condition where `len(self.columns) > 0` to take into account the possibility of `self.columns` being `None`. We will first check if `self.columns` exists (`is not None`) before further processing.

### Corrected Function:
```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns is not None and len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

By checking if `self.columns` is not `None` before attempting to get its length, we prevent the `TypeError` from occurring when `self.columns` is `None`. This change aligns with the suggestion from the GitHub issue to fix the bug.
