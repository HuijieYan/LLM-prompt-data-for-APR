## Analysis:
1. The buggy function `copy` is attempting to check the length of `self.columns` without verifying if it is `None`.
2. The error message indicates that it is trying to retrieve the length of a `NoneType` object.
3. The related GitHub issue suggests that the bug is due to the lack of a check for NoneType in the condition.
4. The suggested solution from the GitHub issue proposes to add a check for `self.columns` existence before checking its length.

## Bug Cause:
The bug is caused by directly checking the length of `self.columns` without verifying if it is `None`. When `self.columns` is `None`, the code tries to get the length of a `None` object, resulting in a TypeError.

## Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
1. Add a check to verify if `self.columns` exists before checking its length.
2. Update the condition to check if `self.columns` exist and have a length greater than 0.

## Corrected Version:
```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
        """
        Defines copying from s3 into redshift.
    
        If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
        """
        logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
        colnames = ''
        if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:  # Check if self.columns exist and have length
            colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
            colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)
    
        cursor.execute("""
         COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
         CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
         {options}
         ;""".format(
            table=self.table,
            colnames=colnames,
            source=f,
            creds=self._credentials(),
            options=self.copy_options())
        )
```

By adding the check `if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0`, we ensure that the code does not attempt to retrieve the length of a `NoneType` object. This correction should resolve the TypeError reported in the failing test and the related GitHub issue.
