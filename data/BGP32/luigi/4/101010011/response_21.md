### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `copy` in the `S3CopyToTable` class is causing an error due to the `columns` attribute being `None`.
2. The error occurs when trying to check the length of `self.columns`, which results in a `TypeError: object of type 'NoneType' has no len()`.
3. The issue is related to the fact that the code doesn't handle the scenario when `self.columns` is `None`, as mentioned in the GitHub issue.
4. To fix the bug, we need to update the condition `if len(self.columns) > 0:` to `if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:` to first check if `self.columns` is not `None` before attempting to find its length.

### Bug Fix:
```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:  # Fix applied here
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options())
    )
```

By making this change, we ensure that the code first checks if `self.columns` is not `None` before trying to access its length. This fix addresses the issue raised in the failing test and the corresponding GitHub issue.
