### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `copy` within the `S3CopyToTable` class is trying to access the length of `self.columns` without checking if it is `None` first, leading to a `TypeError` when `columns` is `None`.
2. The related `copy_options` function is not directly connected to this bug.
3. The error message indicates that the bug occurs when trying to check the length of `self.columns` which is `None`, causing the TypeError. The GitHub issue provides insights into the root cause and suggests a solution.
4. To fix the bug, we need to modify the conditional check for the length of `self.columns` to handle the case where it is `None`.
5. The suggested solution is to modify the check to `if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:` instead of just `if len(self.columns) > 0:`

### Fix:
```python
# The corrected version of the function
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:  # Check if self.columns is not None before accessing its length
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute(
        """
         COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
         CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
         {options}
         ;""".format(
            table=self.table,
            colnames=colnames,
            source=f,
            creds=self._credentials(),
            options=self.copy_options)()  # don't forget to call the function
    )
```

By adding the `if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:` check, we ensure that if `self.columns` is `None`, the program will not try to access its length, avoiding the `TypeError`.
