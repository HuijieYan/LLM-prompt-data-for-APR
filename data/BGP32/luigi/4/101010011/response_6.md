### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `copy` in the `S3CopyToTable` class is trying to check the length of `self.columns` without handling the scenario where `self.columns` could be `None`.
2. The error message clearly states that a `TypeError` is raised when trying to call `len()` on a `NoneType` object.
3. The GitHub issue mentioned indicates that this bug surfaced in version 2.7.1 of Luigi, and suggests a possible solution to handle the `None` case for `self.columns`.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is caused by trying to check the length of `self.columns` directly without verifying if it's not `None` first. This results in a `TypeError` when `self.columns` is `None`.

### Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we should first check if `self.columns` is not `None` before attempting to get its length to prevent the `TypeError`. We can follow the suggestion provided in the GitHub issue by changing the condition to `if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0`.

### Corrected Version:
```python
class S3CopyToTable(rdbms.CopyToTable, _CredentialsMixin):
    def copy_options(self):
        # Please ignore the body of this function

    def copy(self, cursor, f):
        """
        Defines copying from s3 into redshift.
    
        If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
        """
        logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
        colnames = ''
        if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:
            colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
            colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)
    
        cursor.execute("""
         COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
         CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
         {options}
         ;""".format(
            table=self.table,
            colnames=colnames,
            source=f,
            creds=self._credentials(),
            options=self.copy_options())
        )
```

By making this change, the corrected version of the function should now handle the case where `self.columns` is `None` and not raise a `TypeError`.
