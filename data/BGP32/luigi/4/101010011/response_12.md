### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `copy()` in the `S3CopyToTable` class within the `luigi/contrib/redshift.py` file is attempting to check the length of `self.columns` which can be `None`. This causes a `TypeError` when trying to execute `len()` on a `NoneType` object.
2. The error occurs due to the `self.columns` parameter being passed as `None` when no columns are specified, as mentioned in the GitHub issue.
3. The GitHub issue suggests that changing the condition to `if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:` could resolve the problem.
4. The bug can be fixed by ensuring that `self.columns` is checked for being `None` before attempting to calculate its length.
5. A corrected version of the function is provided below.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
- Modify the conditional statement to explicitly check if `self.columns` is not `None` before checking its length.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:  # Check if self.columns is not None before accessing its length
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```
