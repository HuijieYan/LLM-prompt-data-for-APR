### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `copy` in the `S3CopyToTable` class is attempting to check the length of `self.columns`, but it causes an error when `self.columns` is `None`.
2. The error message indicates a `TypeError` because it's not possible to get the length of a `NoneType` object.
3. The GitHub issue linked to this bug highlights that the problem arises when `columns = None`. The suggested fix in the GitHub issue is to modify the condition to `if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0`.
4. The strategy for fixing the bug is to enhance the condition to check if `self.columns` is not `None` before trying to get its length.

### Corrected Version:
```python
class S3CopyToTable(rdbms.CopyToTable, _CredentialsMixin):
    
    def copy_options(self):
        # Please ignore the body of this function
    
    def copy(self, cursor, f):
        """
        Defines copying from s3 into redshift.
    
        If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
        """
        logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
        colnames = ''
        if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:
            colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
            colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)
    
        cursor.execute("""
         COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
         CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
         {options}
         ;""".format(
            table=self.table,
            colnames=colnames,
            source=f,
            creds=self._credentials(),
            options=self.copy_options)
        )
```

By making this small change in the `copy` function to check if `self.columns` is not `None` before accessing its length, we can resolve the `TypeError` issue as reported in the failing test and GitHub issue.
