### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `copy` is trying to check the length of `self.columns`. If `self.columns` is `None`, it raises a `TypeError: object of type 'NoneType' has no len()`.
2. This bug is related to a GitHub issue where the `columns` parameter is set to `None` to prohibit table creation, but it causes an error in the `copy` function due to the incorrect check for the length of `self.columns`.
3. The error occurs when `self.columns` is `None`, but the function is checking its length directly without ensuring that it is not `None`. This leads to the `TypeError`.
4. A strategy to fix the bug is to check if `self.columns` is not `None` before getting its length. By adding an extra condition to handle the `None` case, the error can be avoided.

### Correction:
```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:  # Check if self.columns is not None before getting length
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

By adding the condition `if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:` before trying to get the length of `self.columns`, we ensure that the length is only checked when `self.columns` is not `None`. This correction will prevent the `TypeError` when `columns` is set to `None`.
