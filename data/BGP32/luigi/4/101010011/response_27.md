## Bug Analysis:
1. The `copy()` function is trying to check the length of `self.columns`, which can be `None`.
2. The error is occurring because the code does not handle the scenario where `self.columns` is `None`.
3. The issue on GitHub suggests modifying the condition to `if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:` to avoid the `TypeError`.
4. The current code is not handling the `None` value in `self.columns` properly, causing the test failure.

## Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Modify the condition to check if `self.columns` is not `None` before trying to get its length.
2. Update the condition as per the suggestion provided in the GitHub issue.
3. This will ensure that the code does not raise a `TypeError` when `self.columns` is `None`.

## Corrected Version:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

By incorporating the suggested modification from the GitHub issue, the corrected version of the `copy()` function should now handle the scenario where `self.columns` is `None` without causing a `TypeError`.
