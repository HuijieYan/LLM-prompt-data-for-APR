### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `copy` is trying to access the length of `self.columns` without checking if it is `None`.
2. The related function `copy_options` seems to be working correctly as it is not directly related to the error.
3. The error message indicates a `TypeError` due to trying to get the length of a `NoneType`.
4. The cause of the bug is that when `self.columns` is `None`, the program is trying to calculate the length of `None`, which is not valid.
5. To fix the bug, we need to check if `self.columns` is not `None` before trying to access its length.

### Correction:
```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.
    
    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:  # Check if self.columns is not None
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options())
    )
```

By making the adjustment in the `if` condition to check if `self.columns` is not `None`, we avoid the `TypeError` when trying to access the length of `None`. This corrected version should resolve the bug and pass the failing test.
