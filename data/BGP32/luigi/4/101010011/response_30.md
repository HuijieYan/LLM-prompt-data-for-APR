### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `copy` is attempting to check the length of `self.columns`, but it fails when `self.columns` is `None`.
2. The error message points out that `TypeError: object of type 'NoneType' has no len()`.
3. The GitHub issue mentions that the bug occurs when `columns = None` to prevent table creation, and suggests a solution to check if `self.columns` is not `None` before checking its length.
4. The bug occurs due to the buggy function not handling the scenario where `self.columns` is `None`.
5. To fix the bug, we need to add a condition to check if `self.columns` is not `None` before trying to access its length.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
- Check if `self.columns` is not `None` before checking its length to avoid the `TypeError`.
- Update the `if` condition to include a check for `self.columns` being not `None`.

### Corrected Version:
```python
# The corrected version of the buggy function
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:  # Check if self.columns is not None before accessing its length
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

By adding the `if self.columns` condition before checking the length, the bug is fixed, and the function should now handle the scenario where `columns = None` without causing a `TypeError`.
