### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `copy` is responsible for copying data from S3 to Redshift. The error message indicates that there is a TypeError due to trying to get the length of `self.columns` when it is None.
2. The cause of the bug is that the check for the length of `self.columns` is not handling the case where `self.columns` is None. This leads to a TypeError when trying to call len(None).
3. The related GitHub issue suggests that the bug might be due to changes in the code base that affected the handling of None values for `self.columns`.
4. To fix the bug, we should modify the condition to explicitly check if `self.columns` is not None before checking its length.
5. The corrected version of the `copy` function is provided below.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options())
    )
```

By modifying the condition to `if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0`, we ensure that the length of `self.columns` is only checked if `self.columns` is not None. This change should resolve the TypeError caused by trying to get the length of None.
