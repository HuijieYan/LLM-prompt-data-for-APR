**Analysis:**

1. The buggy function `copy` is attempting to obtain the length of `self.columns`, which could be `None` based on the failing test scenario.
2. The failing test is passing `columns=None` to the `DummyS3CopyToTableKey` object, which results in `self.columns` being `None`.
3. The error message indicates a `TypeError` due to the attempt to get the length of a `NoneType` object.
4. The `colnames` variable is meant to be derived from `self.columns`, and it should be empty if `self.columns` is `None`.
5. The issue originates from trying to get the length of `None`, resulting in the error.

**Strategy for fixing the bug:**

To address the bug, we need to check if `self.columns` is `None` before attempting to find its length. If it is `None`, the `colnames` variable should be assigned an empty string without any further processing.

**Corrected Version:**

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns is not None:  # Check if columns is not None
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

This corrected version explicitly checks if `self.columns` is not `None` before processing it to prevent the `TypeError` that was occurring.
