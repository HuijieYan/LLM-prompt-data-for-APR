### Analysis:
The buggy function `copy` in the class `S3CopyToTable` is failing because it is trying to access the `len()` of `self.columns`, which is None in this case. This leads to a `TypeError: object of type 'NoneType' has no len()` error.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Check if `self.columns` is None before trying to calculate its length.
2. If `self.columns` is None, handle it appropriately to avoid the `TypeError`.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.
    
    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

This corrected version checks if `self.columns` is not None before trying to calculate its length. This will prevent the `TypeError` from occurring when `self.columns` is None.

By making this change, the corrected version of the function should now pass the failing test.
