### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `copy` in the `S3CopyToTable` class is trying to access the `columns` attribute of the class instance `self`. In the failing test, the `columns` attribute is set to `None` which causes a `TypeError`. 
2. The error occurs in the line `if len(self.columns) > 0:` due to the comparison against `None`.
3. The bug is caused by assuming that `self.columns` will always be a list, leading to a `NoneType` object error. The failing test specifically sets the `columns` attribute to `None`, triggering the bug.
4. To fix the bug, we need to check if `self.columns` is not `None` before attempting to compute its length.

### Suggested Fix:
To fix the bug, we should add a check for `None` before trying to compute the length of `self.columns`. If `self.columns` is `None`, then `colnames` should remain an empty string.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns is not None:  # Check if self.columns is not None
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options())
    )
```

By adding the `if self.columns is not None:` check, we make sure that the code does not compute the length of `self.columns` when it is `None`, preventing the `TypeError`.
