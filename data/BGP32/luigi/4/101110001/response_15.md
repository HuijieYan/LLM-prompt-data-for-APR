### Analysis:
1. The buggy function is `copy` inside the `S3CopyToTable` class in `luigi/contrib/redshift.py`.
2. The error is occurring due to the `columns` variable being `None` instead of the expected list, which causes a `TypeError` when trying to calculate its length.
3. The failed test is `test_s3_copy_with_nonetype_columns` in `test/contrib/redshift_test.py`.
4. To fix the bug, we need to handle the case when `self.columns` is `None` before trying to calculate its length.

### Bug Cause:
The bug occurs because the buggy function `copy` tries to calculate the length of `self.columns`, assuming it's a list. When the `columns` parameter is `None`, it leads to a `TypeError` when trying to calculate the length of `None`.

### Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to handle the case when `self.columns` is `None` by checking its type before calculating its length.

### Corrected Buggy Function:
```python
    def copy(self, cursor, f):
        """
        Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

        If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
        """
        logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
        colnames = ''
        if self.columns is not None and len(self.columns) > 0:
            colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
            colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

        cursor.execute("""
         COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
         CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
         {options}
         ;""".format(
            table=self.table,
            colnames=colnames,
            source=f,
            creds=self._credentials(),
            options=self.copy_options())
        )
```

The corrected version includes a check for `self.columns` being `None` before attempting to calculate its length. This will prevent the `TypeError` when `columns` is `None` and allow the function to execute correctly.
