### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `copy` is trying to check the length of `self.columns`, but in the failing test, `task` is created with `columns=None`, leading to the `TypeError` because `NoneType` does not have a length.
2. The error occurs in the `if len(self.columns) > 0:` line in the `copy` function.
3. The cause of the bug is that when `columns=None` is passed to the `DummyS3CopyToTableKey` class, it sets `self.columns` to `None`, leading to the `TypeError` when trying to check its length.
4. The bug can be fixed by adding a conditional check for `None` before checking the length of `self.columns`.

### Bug Fix:
Here is the corrected version of the `copy` function:
```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns is not None and len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

By adding the `if self.columns is not None:` check, we prevent the `TypeError` from occurring when `columns` is `None`. Now, the corrected version of the function should pass the failing test.
