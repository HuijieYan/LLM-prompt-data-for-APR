### Analysis:
The buggy function `copy` is attempting to check the length of `self.columns`, but the `columns` attribute is initialized as `None` in the `DummyS3CopyToTableKey` instance. This causes a `TypeError` when trying to call `len()` on a `NoneType` object.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is caused due to the `columns` attribute being set to `None`. When the `copy` function attempts to check the length of `self.columns`, it encounters an error since `None` does not have a length.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we should ensure that the `columns` attribute is always initialized as a list to avoid issues when checking its length. This can be achieved by updating the `DummyS3CopyToTableKey` class initialization to set `columns=[]` instead of `columns=None`.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns is not None:  # Check if columns is not None before accessing its length
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

By making this change in the `copy` function, it will handle the case when `self.columns` is `None` by checking for its existence before trying to access its length, preventing the `TypeError` from occurring.
