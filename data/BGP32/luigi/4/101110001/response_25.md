### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `copy` in the `S3CopyToTable` class is attempting to check the length of the `self.columns` attribute which is causing an error when `self.columns` is `None`.
2. The error message indicates that a TypeError occurs when attempting to get the length of a `NoneType` object (`self.columns`).
3. The issue stems from the fact that the `self.columns` attribute is set to `None` in the `DummyS3CopyToTableKey` instance, causing the length check to fail.
4. To fix this bug, we need to account for the possibility of `self.columns` being `None` and handle it correctly in the `copy` function.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
- Check if `self.columns` is not `None` before attempting to get its length.
- If `self.columns` is `None`, set `colnames` to an empty string.
- Modify the `format` method in the `cursor.execute` call to handle the case where `colnames` could be empty.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns is not None:  # Check if columns is not None
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options())
    )
```

In the corrected version:
- We check if `self.columns` is not `None` before processing it to avoid the TypeError.
- The `colnames` variable is set to an empty string if `self.columns` is `None`.
- The `format` method in `cursor.execute` now correctly handles the case where `colnames` is empty.
