### Analysis:
1. The `copy` function in the `S3CopyToTable` class is attempting to check the length of the `columns` attribute of the task. The error message indicates that the `columns` attribute is of type `NoneType`, leading to a `TypeError` when trying to check its length.
2. The issue lies in the comparison `if len(self.columns) > 0`. When `self.columns` is `None`, the code should handle this case to prevent the error.
3. The failing test case provides a mock `RedshiftTarget` object, creates an instance of `DummyS3CopyToTableKey` with `columns=None`, and attempts to run the task. When `self.columns` is `None`, the `TypeError` occurs as expected.
4. To fix the bug, we need to handle the case where `self.columns` is `None` by performing a null check before checking the length.
5. Below is the corrected version of the `copy` function:

### Corrected Function:
```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns is not None and len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

By adding a null check `if self.columns is not None` before attempting to check the length, the bug should be resolved.
