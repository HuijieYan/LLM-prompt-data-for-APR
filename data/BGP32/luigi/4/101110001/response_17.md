### Analysis:
1. The function `copy` in the `S3CopyToTable` class is expected to copy data from S3 into Redshift. 
2. The failing test `test_s3_copy_with_nonetype_columns` creates an instance of `DummyS3CopyToTableKey` with `columns=None`, which should trigger the buggy function.
3. The error occurs when trying to get the length of `self.columns`, which is `None`, hence the `TypeError` as `NoneType` has no length.
4. The bug is in the condition `if len(self.columns) > 0`, assuming `self.columns` can be `None`.
5. To fix the bug, we need to handle the case where `self.columns` is `None` before checking its length.

### Proposed Fix:
Here's the corrected version of the `copy` function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

By adding the check `if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0`, we ensure that if `self.columns` is `None`, it won't throw a `TypeError`. This change will make the function handle the `None` case gracefully.
