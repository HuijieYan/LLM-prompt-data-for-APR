1. Analysis:
The buggy function `copy` in the `S3CopyToTable` class in the `luigi/contrib/redshift.py` file is failing because it is trying to get the length of `self.columns`, but `self.columns` is set to `None`. This results in a `TypeError`.

2. Potential error location:
The error occurs at the line:
```python
if len(self.columns) > 0:
```

3. Cause of the bug:
The bug is caused by the comparison `len(self.columns) > 0` where `self.columns` is `None`, leading to a `TypeError` since `NoneType` does not have a length.

4. Strategy for fixing the bug:
To fix the bug, we need to handle the case where `self.columns` is `None` before checking its length.

5. Corrected version of the function:
Here is the corrected version of the `copy` function:
```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

This modification ensures that the length of `self.columns` is only checked if `self.columns` is not `None`, avoiding the `TypeError` encountered in the failing test.
