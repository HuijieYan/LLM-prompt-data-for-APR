### Analysis:
1. The error message indicates a `TypeError` due to calling `len()` on `self.columns` when it is `None`.
2. The buggy function `copy` is trying to generate the `colnames` string for the SQL query based on the input columns. When `self.columns` is `None`, it causes the error.
3. The failing test is setting `columns` attribute to `None` in the `DummyS3CopyToTableKey` object which is causing the `TypeError` in the `copy` function of `S3CopyToTable` class.
4. To fix the bug, we need to handle the case where `self.columns` is `None` before trying to get its length.

### Suggestions for Fixing the Bug:
1. Check if `self.columns` is `None` before trying to get its length in the `copy` function.
2. If `self.columns` is `None`, handle it appropriately. For example, set `colnames` to an empty string.
3. Update the SQL query generation logic to consider the case where no columns are provided.
4. Make sure to update the test case to reflect the corrected behavior.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    
    if self.columns is not None:  # Check if columns are provided
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
``` 

By adding the `if self.columns is not None:` condition, we ensure that the `copy` function can handle the case where `columns` attribute is `None`. This should fix the `TypeError` issue reported in the failing test.
