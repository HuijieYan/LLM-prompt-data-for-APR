### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `copy` inside the `S3CopyToTable` class is attempting to check the length of `self.columns` without handling the case when `self.columns` is `None`, leading to a `TypeError` when trying to use `len()` on a `NoneType` object.
2. The failing test `test_s3_copy_with_nonetype_columns` creates an instance of `DummyS3CopyToTableKey` with `columns=None` and then calls the `run` method, which in turn calls the `copy` method with `cursor` and `path`.
3. The error message indicates a `TypeError` at line 338 in `luigi/contrib/redshift.py` where `len(self.columns)` is being used.
4. To fix the bug, we need to handle the case when `self.columns` is `None` before calling `len()` on it.
5. We should modify the code of the `copy` function to include an additional check to handle the `None` case for `self.columns`.

### Suggested Fix:
```python
    def copy(self, cursor, f):
        """
        Defines copying from s3 into redshift.
    
        If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
        """
        logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
        colnames = ''
        if self.columns is not None:  # Check if self.columns is not None
            if len(self.columns) > 0:
                colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
                colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)
    
        cursor.execute("""
         COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
         CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
         {options}
         ;""".format(
            table=self.table,
            colnames=colnames,
            source=f,
            creds=self._credentials(),
            options=self.copy_options())
        )
```

### Corrected Version:
The corrected version of the `copy` function has been modified to handle the case when `self.columns` is `None` by adding an extra check before using `len()` on `self.columns`.

After making this change, the `TypeError` should be resolved, and the function should now execute correctly without any errors.
