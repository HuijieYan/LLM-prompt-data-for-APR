### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `copy` in the `S3CopyToTable` class is failing due to the comparison `len(self.columns) > 0` where `self.columns` is set to `None` resulting in a `TypeError`.
2. The error message indicates that it's trying to get the length of a `NoneType` object which is not possible.
3. The buggy function is supposed to construct an SQL query string for the `COPY` command, but it fails when trying to determine the column names if `self.columns` is `None`.
4. To fix the bug, we need to handle the case where `self.columns` is `None` by checking if it is not `None` before trying to get its length.

### Solution:
```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:  # Fix: Check if self.columns is not None before getting length
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

By adding the check `if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0`, we ensure that the comparison is only done when `self.columns` is not `None`. This will prevent the `TypeError` that was occurring in the failing test case.
