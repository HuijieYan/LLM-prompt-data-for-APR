### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `copy` in the `S3CopyToTable` class is trying to access the `columns` attribute of the class instance (`self`) without checking if it is `None` or not. This causes a `TypeError` when trying to check the length of the `NoneType` object.
2. The failing test `test_s3_copy_with_nonetype_columns` creates an instance of the `DummyS3CopyToTableKey` class with `columns=None` and calls the `run` method which in turn calls the buggy `copy` method.
3. The error message indicates that the `TypeError` occurred in the `copy` method due to trying to check the length of a `NoneType` object.

### Bug Cause:
The bug occurs because the buggy function is trying to check the length of the `self.columns` attribute without first checking if it is `None` or not. Since `self.columns` is set to `None` in the failing test, it leads to a `TypeError` when trying to call `len` on a `NoneType` object.

### Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to add a check to handle the case where the `columns` attribute is `None`. If it is `None`, we should provide a default behavior or handle it appropriately to avoid the `TypeError`.

### Corrected Version:
```python
class S3CopyToTable(rdbms.CopyToTable, _CredentialsMixin):
    def copy_options(self):
        # Implementation here

    def copy(self, cursor, f):
        logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
        colnames = ''
        if self.columns is not None:  # Check if columns is not None before processing
            colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
            colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

        cursor.execute("""
         COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
         CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
         {options}
         ;""".format(
            table=self.table,
            colnames=colnames,
            source=f,
            creds=self._credentials(),
            options=self.copy_options())
        )
```

By checking if `self.columns` is not `None` before processing it in the `copy` method, we can avoid the `TypeError` caused by calling `len` on a `NoneType` object. This corrected version should pass the failing test by handling the `columns` attribute appropriately.
