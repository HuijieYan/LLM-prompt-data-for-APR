### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `copy` in the class `S3CopyToTable` is attempting to check the length of `self.columns`, which is set to `None` in the failing test. This results in a `TypeError` when trying to perform `len(None)`.
2. The error occurs in the context of attempting to determine the length of `self.columns`, where `columns` is set to `None` in the failing test.
3. The cause of the bug is that the buggy function is not handling the case where `self.columns` is set to `None`.
4. To fix the bug, we need to check whether `self.columns` is not `None` before attempting to get its length.
5. The corrected version of the function will include a condition to handle the case where `self.columns` is `None`.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns is not None:  # Check if self.columns is not None
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

By including the check `if self.columns is not None`, the corrected version of the `copy` function avoids the `TypeError` when `self.columns` is `None`. This correction will allow the function to work as expected and pass the failing test.
