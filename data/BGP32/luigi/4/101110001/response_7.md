### Analysis:
- The buggy function `copy` is attempting to check the length of `self.columns`, which is a list of columns to copy, but the buggy test is providing `None` as the value of `columns`.
- The `copy` function is assuming `self.columns` will always be a list and does not handle the case when it is `None`, leading to a `TypeError`.
- The error message clearly indicates that `object of type 'NoneType' has no len()`, meaning the code is trying to get the length of a `None`.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
- Check if `self.columns` is `None` before checking its length.
- Provide a default value or handle the `None` case appropriately to avoid the `TypeError`.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from S3 into Redshift.
    
    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)
    
    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options())
    )
```

### Summary of Changes:
- Added a check `if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0` to handle the case when `self.columns` is `None`.
- Corrected the call to `self.copy_options()` as a method call instead of a reference to the function itself.
