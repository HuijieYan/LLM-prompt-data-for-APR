The buggy function `copy` is failing due to the following reasons:
1. It is not handling the case where `self.columns` is `None` properly. When `self.columns` is `None`, it results in a `TypeError` when trying to get the length of `None`.
2. The `copy_options` function used as `self.copy_options` in the SQL query construction is not being called properly. It should be `self.copy_options()` to actually execute the function call.

To fix the bug:
1. Check if `self.columns` is `None` before trying to access its length. If it is `None`, handle this case appropriately.
2. Change `self.copy_options` to `self.copy_options()` to actually call the function and use its return value in the SQL query.

Here is the corrected version of the `copy` function:
```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns is not None:  # Check if self.columns is not None
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options())  # Call self.copy_options() to actually execute the function
    )
```

With this correction, the `copy` function will now handle the case where `self.columns` is `None` and call `self.copy_options()` properly, resolving the `TypeError` and passing the failing test.
