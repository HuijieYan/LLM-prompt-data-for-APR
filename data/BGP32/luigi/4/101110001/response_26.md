### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `copy` is attempting to check the length of `self.columns`, which is expected to be a list of columns. However, in the failing test, `columns` is assigned a value of `None`, leading to a `TypeError` when trying to check the length of a `NoneType` object.
2. The error message indicates the exact line where the error occurred in the `copy` function.
3. The failing test is aimed at testing the behavior when `columns` is `None`, which is not handled correctly in the `copy` function.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is caused by assuming that `self.columns` will always be a list to check its length. When `columns` is `None`, the buggy function raises a `TypeError` when trying to get the length of a `NoneType` object.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to handle the case when `columns` is `None` before attempting to check its length. This can be done by adding a condition to explicitly check if `columns` is not `None` before trying to get its length.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns is not None:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options())
    )
```

In the corrected version, we added a condition `if self.columns is not None:` to check if `columns` is `None` before attempting to get its length. This ensures that the buggy function can handle the case when `columns` is `None` without raising a `TypeError`.
