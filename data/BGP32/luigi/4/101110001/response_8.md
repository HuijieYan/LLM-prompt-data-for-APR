### Analysis:
The bug occurs in the `copy` method of the `S3CopyToTable` class. The `if len(self.columns) > 0:` statement is causing a `TypeError` because `self.columns` is `None` when `columns=None` is passed during initialization in the test. This results in the error `TypeError: object of type 'NoneType' has no len()`.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to handle the case where `self.columns` is `None` in the `copy` method. We can do this by checking if `self.columns` is not `None` before performing the `len(self.columns)` check.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    
    if self.columns is not None and len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)
    
    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

With this change, the `if` statement now first checks if `self.columns` is not `None` before calculating its length. This fix will prevent the `TypeError` when `columns=None` is passed during initialization.
