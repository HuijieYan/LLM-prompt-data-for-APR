The buggy function `copy` in the `S3CopyToTable` class is encountering an error due to trying to access the `len()` function on a variable `columns` that is set to `None`. This results in a `TypeError` since `NoneType` objects do not have the `len()` function.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the `copy` function to first check if the `columns` variable is not `None` before trying to use the `len()` function on it. If columns is `None`, we should handle it appropriately to avoid the `TypeError`.

Here is the corrected version of the `copy` function that addresses the bug:

```python
# The corrected version of the buggy function
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns is not None and len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

With this fix, the `copy` function first checks if `self.columns` is not `None` before trying to get the length of it. This prevents the `TypeError` encountered in the failing test. Now, the corrected version of the function should pass the failing test.
