### Analysis and Explanation:
The buggy function `copy` in the `luigi/contrib/redshift.py` file is failing to properly handle cases where the `columns` parameter is `None`. This results in an incorrect `colnames` variable being generated and used in the SQL query.

In the failing test `test_s3_copy_with_nonetype_columns` in `test/contrib/redshift_test.py`, the `DummyS3CopyToTableKey` task is created with `columns=None`, which triggers the bug in the `copy` function. The expected `colnames` value in this case is an empty string, but the buggy function does not handle this scenario correctly.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix this bug, the `copy` function needs to check if the `columns` attribute is `None` and handle it appropriately by setting `colnames` to an empty string in this case. This will ensure that the SQL query is generated correctly even when the columns are not specified.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns is not None:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

The corrected version of the `copy` function now properly handles the case where `columns` is `None` by setting `colnames` to an empty string in that scenario. This fix ensures that the SQL query is generated correctly and the function behaves as expected in all cases.
