### Bug Explanation
The bug in the `copy` function lies in the way the `colnames` variable is being constructed. Since the `columns` parameter can be `None`, the condition `if len(self.columns) > 0:` is incorrect. If `columns` is `None`, trying to access its length will result in an error.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to check if `self.columns` is not `None` before attempting to access its length. If it is `None`, we can directly assign an empty string to `colnames`.

### Corrected Version of the Function

```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: luigi/contrib/redshift.py

def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns is not None:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

With this correction, the `copy` function should now handle the case when `columns` is `None` properly.
