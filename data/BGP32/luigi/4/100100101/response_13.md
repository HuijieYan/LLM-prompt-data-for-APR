The bug in the `copy` function lies in the handling of `colnames` where it remains an empty string. This results in an extra comma in the `COPY` statement when `colnames` is empty.

To fix this issue, we can check if `colnames` is empty before adding it to the `COPY` statement.

Here is the corrected version of the `copy` function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

This fix checks if `self.columns` is not None before constructing `colnames`. This way, the extra comma will be eliminated when `colnames` is empty.

By applying this correction, the function should now pass the failing test case provided.
