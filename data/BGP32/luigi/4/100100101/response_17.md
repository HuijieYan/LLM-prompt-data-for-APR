The bug in this function lies in how the `colnames` variable is handled. The `colnames` variable is initialized as an empty string and then updated based on the columns provided. However, if `self.columns` is None (as in the failing test case), the `colnames` variable remains an empty string.

Since the expected behavior is to have an empty string instead of NULL when `self.columns` is None, we need to update the code to handle this case.

Here is the corrected version of the `copy` function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:  # Check if self.columns is not None
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

With this correction, the `colnames` variable will be an empty string when `self.columns` is None, as expected in the failing test scenario. This corrected version should now pass the failing test.
