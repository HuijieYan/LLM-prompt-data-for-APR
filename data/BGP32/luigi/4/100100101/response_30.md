### Bug in the original code:
The bug in the original code is that the `colnames` variable is being initialized as an empty string, but it is not being used in the `COPY` statement. This results in an extra comma in the SQL query, which causes the test to fail.

### Strategy for fixing the bug:
To fix the bug, we need to make sure that if `self.columns` is empty, the `colnames` variable should not be included in the `COPY` statement to avoid the extra comma.

### Corrected version of the function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

After applying this fix, the function should now handle cases where `self.columns` is empty and not include unnecessary commas in the `COPY` statement. This corrected version should pass the failing test provided.
