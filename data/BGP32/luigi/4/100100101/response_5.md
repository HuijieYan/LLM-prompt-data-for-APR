### Analysis
The buggy function has an issue where it tries to format the `colnames` variable within the SQL query, even when `self.columns` is `None` (null). This results in an empty `colnames` being passed to the `COPY` SQL statement, causing a mismatch in the expected SQL query in the test function.

### Bug Explanation
The bug occurs because the `colnames` variable is being set to an empty string when `self.columns` is `None`. This leads to an incorrect SQL query where the column names part is empty, causing the test to fail.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix this bug, we need to check if `self.columns` is `None` before constructing the `colnames` variable. If `self.columns` is not `None`, then we construct the comma-separated string of column names.

### Corrected Version
```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns is not None:  # Check if self.columns is not None
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

By adding the check `if self.columns is not None`, we ensure that the `colnames` variable will only be constructed if `self.columns` is not `None`, fixing the bug and allowing the function to generate the correct SQL query in the test.
