Potential error locations within the buggy function:
- The condition `if len(self.columns) > 0` is checking if `self.columns` is not empty, but it should be checking if `self.columns` is not None. This could lead to incorrect logic when determining the value for `colnames`.

The cause of the bug:
- The buggy function fails to handle the case when `self.columns` is None. This results in an empty `colnames`, even when columns are not explicitly provided.

Strategy for fixing the bug:
- Check if `self.columns` is None instead of checking its length, and handle the case appropriately to ensure correct behavior.

Corrected version of the function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns is not None:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
``` 

With this correction, the function will properly handle the case when `self.columns` is None and set `colnames` accordingly. This should allow the function to pass the failing test case provided.
