The bug in the provided function is that when the columns list is empty (`None`), the `colnames` variable is not properly handled, leading to an empty string being passed to the `COPY` SQL statement instead of skipping it altogether. This results in an incorrect SQL query being executed.

To fix this bug, we need to check if `self.columns` is `None` before constructing the `colnames` string. If it is `None`, we can skip adding the column names section to the `COPY` statement.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns is not None:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

With this correction, the `COPY` statement will correctly handle cases where the `columns` attribute is `None`, and the function should now pass the failing test case provided.
