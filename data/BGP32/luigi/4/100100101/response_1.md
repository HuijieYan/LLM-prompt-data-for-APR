### Bug Explanation
The bug in the `copy` function lies in the construction of the `colnames` variable. If `self.columns` is `None`, the code correctly sets `colnames` to an empty string. However, the `colnames` variable is still being included in the `COPY` SQL query even when it's empty, which leads to incorrect query syntax.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the `colnames` variable is only included in the `COPY` SQL query when it is not empty. We can achieve this by checking if `colnames` is empty before adding it to the query.

### Corrected Version of the `copy` Function
```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    query_template = "COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}' CREDENTIALS '{creds}' {options};"
    query = query_template.format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options
    )

    cursor.execute(query)
```

By making these changes, the corrected `copy` function will only include the `colnames` in the `COPY` SQL query if it is not empty, ensuring correct query syntax.
