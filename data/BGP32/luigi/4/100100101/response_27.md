The bug in the provided function is related to the generation of the `colnames` variable when `self.columns` is `None`. This leads to an extra comma in the `COPY` statement, which causes the failing test since the expected `colnames` value is an empty string.

To fix this bug, we need to check if `self.columns` is `None` before creating the `colnames` string. If `self.columns` is not `None`, then we proceed with joining the column names. Otherwise, we assign an empty string to `colnames`.

Here is the corrected version of the function:
```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns is not None:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

This corrected version of the function will handle the case when `self.columns` is `None` correctly, resulting in the expected behavior for the failing test.

Now, when the test case `test_s3_copy_with_nonetype_columns` is executed, the corrected function should pass and satisfy the expected input/output values.
