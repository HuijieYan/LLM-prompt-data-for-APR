The bug in the provided function is that the `COPY` SQL statement is not indented correctly in the `cursor.execute` call. This causes the `mock_cursor.execute` assertion in the test to fail because the expected and actual SQL strings do not match due to the extra spaces at the beginning of each line in the SQL string.

To fix this bug, we need to remove the extra spaces at the beginning of each line in the `cursor.execute` call.

Here is the corrected version of the function:
```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: luigi/contrib/redshift.py

def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
{options}
;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

With this correction, the `COPY` SQL statement will have the correct indentation and the test will pass as the expected and actual SQL strings will match.
