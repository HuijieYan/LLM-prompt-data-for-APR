### Analysis:
The buggy function `copy` in the `redshift.py` file is not handling the case where no columns are provided correctly. The `colnames` variable should be left empty when `self.columns` is `None`.

### Bug Explanation:
The bug occurs because the buggy function does not account for the scenario when `self.columns` is `None`. This leads to an incorrect `colnames` value being used in the `COPY` SQL query.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
Update the logic inside the `copy` function to handle the case when `self.columns` is `None`. When `self.columns` is `None`, set `colnames` to an empty string.

### Corrected Version:
```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: luigi/contrib/redshift.py

# Corrected version of the buggy function
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns is not None:  # Handle None columns case
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

By updating the logic to check for `self.columns` being `None`, the corrected function will now handle the case correctly and provide the expected behavior during the failing test execution.
