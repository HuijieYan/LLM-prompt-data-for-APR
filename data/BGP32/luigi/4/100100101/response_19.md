### Bug Explanation
The bug in the `copy` function lies in the way the `colnames` variable is being constructed. If `self.columns` is `None` (as in the failing test case), the `colnames` variable remains an empty string `''`. However, in the `execute` statement, the `colnames` are still being included in the query even if it is empty, which is causing the syntax error.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to conditionally include the `colnames` in the `COPY` query only if it is not an empty string. This way, the syntax of the `COPY` statement will be correct even if there are no column names to include.

### Corrected Version of the Function
```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    copy_query_template = """
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;"""
    
    copy_query = copy_query_template.format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options
    )
    
    cursor.execute(copy_query)
```

By checking if `self.columns` is not empty, we conditionally construct the `colnames` and only include it in the `COPY` query if there are actual column names to include. This correction should fix the bug and make the function work as expected in the failing test case.
