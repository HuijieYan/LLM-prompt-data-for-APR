The bug in the provided function is that when `self.columns` is `None`, the `colnames` variable is not handled properly causing an extra comma in the `COPY` statement.

### Cause of the bug:
- When `self.columns` is `None`, the `colnames` variable is initialized as an empty string.
- However, the logic for handling `colnames` is incorrect when it is an empty string.
- This leads to an extra comma at the beginning of the `colnames` variable in the `COPY` statement.

### Strategy for fixing the bug:
- Modify the logic of handling `colnames` when it is an empty string to avoid an extra comma in the `COPY` statement.
- Check if `self.columns` is not `None` before manipulating `colnames`.

### Corrected version of the function:
```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

By implementing this corrected version of the function, it should now handle the case when `self.columns` is `None` correctly, avoiding the extra comma in the `COPY` statement. This corrected version should satisfy the expected input/output values and pass the failing test.
