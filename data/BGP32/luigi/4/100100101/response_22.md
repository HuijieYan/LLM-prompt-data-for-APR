The bug in the provided `copy` function lies in the condition where it checks if there are columns specified (`len(self.columns) > 0`). If `self.columns` is `None`, the condition `len(self.columns) > 0` would evaluate to False, leading to an empty `colnames` variable being used in the `COPY` query.

To fix this bug, we need to handle the case where `self.columns` is `None` separately and set `colnames` to an empty string in that case.

Here is the corrected version of the `copy` function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns is not None:  # Check if columns are specified
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

By adding the check `if self.columns is not None:` before processing the columns, we ensure that the code handles the case where `self.columns` is `None` correctly.

With this correction, the `copy` function should now correctly handle the scenario where `self.columns` is `None`, as expected.

This corrected version of the `copy` function should pass the failing test provided.
