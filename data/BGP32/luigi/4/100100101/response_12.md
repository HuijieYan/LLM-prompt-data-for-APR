The bug in the `copy` function lies in the way the `colnames` variable is constructed and used in the SQL query. When `self.columns` is None, the `colnames` variable is set to an empty string, but it should not be included in the `COPY` statement if no columns are provided.

To fix this issue, we can modify the `copy` function to only include the `colnames` in the query if there are columns specified. Here is the corrected version of the `copy` function:

```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: luigi/contrib/redshift.py

# The corrected version of the buggy function
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    
    if self.columns:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)
    else:
        colnames = ''

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

With this correction, the `colnames` variable will only be included in the `COPY` statement if there are columns specified, satisfying the expected behavior in the failing test case.
