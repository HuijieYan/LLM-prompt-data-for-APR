The bug in the provided function `copy` is that it does not handle the case where the `columns` attribute is `None`. This leads to an issue when trying to format the `colnames` variable for the `COPY` statement.

To fix this bug, we need to check if `self.columns` is not `None` before trying to create the column names string. If `self.columns` is `None`, then `colnames` should remain an empty string.

Here is the corrected version of the `copy` function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns is not None:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

With this correction, the function will now handle the case where `self.columns` is `None` and set `colnames` to an empty string accordingly. This will prevent the formatting issue in the `COPY` statement when running the failing test.

The corrected function should now pass the failing test provided.
