The bug in the provided `copy` function lies in the way the `colnames` variable is being handled. When the columns are set to `None`, the code is not accounting for this scenario, leading to an empty `colnames` variable being added to the SQL query.

The corrected version of the function should check if `self.columns` is `None` and handle the `colnames` variable accordingly.

Here is the corrected version of the `copy` function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    if self.columns is not None:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)
    else:
        colnames = ''

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

This corrected version introduces a check for `self.columns` being `None` and sets `colnames` accordingly. This change ensures that the SQL query is formatted correctly even when no columns are specified.
