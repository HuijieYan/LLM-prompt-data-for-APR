The bug in the provided `copy` function lies in the generation of the `colnames` variable. When the `columns` attribute of the `self` object is `None`, the `colnames` variable remains as an empty string. However, in the `COPY` statement, if `colnames` is empty, the function should omit the column names part in the query.

To fix this bug, we need to adjust the logic related to the `colnames` variable in the `copy` function to properly handle the case when `self.columns` is `None`.

Here is the corrected version of the `copy` function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns is not None and len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

With this correction, the function will now properly handle the case where the `columns` attribute is `None`.

This corrected version should pass the failing test provided.
