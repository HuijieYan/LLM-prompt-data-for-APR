### Issue:
The bug in the `copy` function arises from the way the `colnames` variable is handled. When the `columns` attribute is `None`, the `colnames` variable is initialized as an empty string, but it is not properly handled in the `COPY` SQL statement, leading to incorrect formatting.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that when the `columns` attribute is `None`, the `colnames` variable is skipped in the `COPY` SQL statement, preventing any syntax errors.

### Corrected Version of the `copy` function:
```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns is not None:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

By checking if `self.columns` is not `None` before constructing the `colnames` variable, we ensure that the `COPY` SQL statement is properly formatted even when there are no columns specified. This correction should pass the failing test case `test_s3_copy_with_nonetype_columns`.
