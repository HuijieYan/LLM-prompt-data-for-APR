The bug in the `copy` function stems from the if condition checking the length of `self.columns` to determine if `colnames` should be constructed. The bug occurs when `self.columns` is `None`, as the length of `None` is not greater than 0. This results in `colnames` not being created and the `COPY` statement being malformed.

To fix this bug, we should explicitly check if `self.columns` is not `None` before constructing `colnames`.

Here is the corrected version of the `copy` function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns is not None:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

With this correction, the `colnames` variable will be formed correctly regardless of whether `self.columns` is `None` or not. This will fix the bug and ensure that the `COPY` statement is properly formatted.
