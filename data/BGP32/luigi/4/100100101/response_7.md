The buggy function has an issue with how it handles the columns parameter when it is None. The buggy function tries to construct the colnames variable by joining the column names, but does not consider the case when columns is None, leading to an empty string not being handled correctly.

The bug causes the colnames variable to remain as an empty string, which results in an incorrect SQL statement being generated with an extra comma for the column names.

To fix the bug, we need to check if self.columns is not None before constructing the colnames variable to avoid the extra comma in the SQL statement.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames) if colnames else ''

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

This corrected version includes a check for self.columns to handle the case when it is None. If self.columns is not None, it constructs the colnames variable with the column names joined by commas, otherwise, it sets colnames to an empty string. This ensures that the generated SQL statement does not include an extra comma when the column names are empty.
