### Bug Explanation
The bug in the `copy` function is that the `colnames` variable is calculated correctly as an empty string when the `columns` attribute of the `DummyS3CopyToTableKey` instance is `None`. However, when constructing the SQL query, the `colnames` variable is still being used even if it's an empty string, resulting in an extra comma in the `COPY` statement, which causes the test to fail.

### Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to adjust the construction of the `COPY` statement in the `cursor.execute` call to not include the `colnames` section if it's an empty string.

### Corrected Version of the Function
```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames if colnames else '',
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

With this correction, we now check if `colnames` is empty before including it in the `COPY` statement. This ensures that no extra commas are added when the `columns` attribute is `None`, and the test should pass successfully.
