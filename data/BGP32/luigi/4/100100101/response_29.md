### Bug Explanation
The bug in the `copy` function lies in the construction of the `colnames` variable before executing the `COPY` statement. When the `columns` attribute of the `self` object is `None`, the `colnames` variable is set to an empty string, but it is not handled correctly in the `COPY` statement construction. The function should not include the empty `colnames` in the `COPY` statement when it's empty.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to modify the construction of the `COPY` statement to handle the case when the `colnames` variable is empty properly. We can use conditional logic to include `colnames` only when it is not empty.

### Corrected Version of the Function
```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    copy_statement = """
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames if colnames else '',
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options
    )

    cursor.execute(copy_statement)
``` 

By incorporating the conditional logic to include `colnames` only when it is not empty, the corrected function will now handle the case when `self.columns` is `None` and construct the `COPY` statement properly for the test scenario provided.
