### Analysis:
The buggy function `copy` is failing to properly handle the case when `self.columns` is `None`, which results in an empty `colnames` variable being used in the `COPY` SQL statement. This causes issues with the formatting of the SQL query.

### Bug:
The bug in the function arises from the logic to construct the `colnames` variable for the SQL statement. When `self.columns` is `None`, the `colnames` variable is set to an empty string, resulting in incorrect SQL formatting.

### Fix:
To fix the bug, we need to handle the case when `self.columns` is `None` and adjust the logic for constructing the `colnames` variable accordingly.

### Corrected version of the function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns is not None:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

By checking if `self.columns` is not `None` before constructing the `colnames` variable, the corrected function will handle the case of `self.columns` being `None` appropriately. This change ensures that the `colnames` variable will be correctly formatted in the SQL query, fixing the bug.
