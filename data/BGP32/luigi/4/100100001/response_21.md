The bug in the `copy` function arises from the way the SQL query is formatted. The issue lies in improper string formatting with multiline SQL queries. When using multiline SQL queries with `cursor.execute`, any leading whitespace or tabs need to match across all lines to maintain proper indentation.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure consistent whitespace in the multiline SQL query. One way to achieve this is by stripping the leading whitespace from the SQL query string before passing it to `cursor.execute`.

Here is the corrected version of the `copy` function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    sql_query = """
    COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
    CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
    {options}
    ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options
    )

    cursor.execute(sql_query.strip())
```

This corrected version ensures that the SQL query is formatted correctly with consistent whitespace indentation. Now, the `copy` function should work properly and pass the failing test.
