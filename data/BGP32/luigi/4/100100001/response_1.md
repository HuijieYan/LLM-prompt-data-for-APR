## Analysis:
The buggy function `copy` in the `luigi/contrib/redshift.py` file is not correctly formatting the `COPY` statement for Redshift. The issue arises from the way the `colnames` (column names) variable is being handled when there are no columns specified.

## Bug:
When `self.columns` is None or an empty list, the `colnames` variable is left empty. However, the buggy function still adds an empty `colnames` to the `COPY` statement, causing a syntax error.

## Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to check if `self.columns` is None or empty before adding `colnames` to the `COPY` statement. If `self.columns` is empty or None, we should skip adding the column names section to the query.

## Corrected Version:
```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
    COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
    CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
    {options}
    ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

With this corrected version, the `COPY` statement formation in the `copy` function should now handle the case when `self.columns` is None or empty correctly, avoiding the syntax error.
