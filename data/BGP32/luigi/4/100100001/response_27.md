The bug in the provided function `copy` lies in the formatting of the SQL query in the `cursor.execute` function call. The string interpolation is not handling the multi-line format correctly, resulting in incorrect indentation and mismatched placeholders.

To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the multi-line SQL query is formatted correctly to maintain the intended structure. One way to do this is by using triple quotes for the multi-line string literal and proper indentation to align placeholders.

Here is the corrected version of the `copy` function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute(f"""
     COPY {self.table} {colnames} from '{f}'
     CREDENTIALS '{self._credentials()}'
     {self.copy_options}
     ;
     """)
```

With this corrected version, the multi-line SQL query within `cursor.execute` is properly formatted using triple quotes, maintaining the intended structure.

This corrected version should now pass the failing test provided.
