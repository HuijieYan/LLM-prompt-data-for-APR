The bug in the `copy` function lies in the way the `colnames` variable is handled. When `self.columns` is `None` (as in the failing test case `test_s3_copy_with_nonetype_columns`), an empty `colnames` string should be used. However, the current implementation does not account for this case, leading to an error when trying to format the SQL query.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the logic for constructing the `colnames` string to handle the case when `self.columns` is `None`. We can also clean up the code for better readability.

Here is the corrected version of the `copy` function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    
    if self.columns:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)
    else:
        colnames = ''

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

With this corrected version, the `copy` function should now handle the case when `self.columns` is `None` and pass the failing test case `test_s3_copy_with_nonetype_columns`.
