The bug in the provided code is that the `colnames` variable is being set to an empty string in the `copy` function, even when columns are provided. This results in the `colnames` not being correctly generated for the `COPY` SQL statement, causing a mismatch between the expected and actual SQL in the test function.

To fix this issue, we should only construct the `colnames` string if there are columns provided. We can do this by checking if `self.columns` is not `None` before generating the `colnames` variable.

Here is the corrected version of the `copy` function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns is not None and len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

By making this change, the `colnames` variable will only be constructed if there are columns provided, which should fix the bug and make the function work correctly with the test function provided.
