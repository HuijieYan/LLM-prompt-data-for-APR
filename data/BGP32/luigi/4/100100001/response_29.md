The bug in the provided function `copy` is that it assumes the `colnames` are always provided, resulting in incorrect SQL generation when `columns` is `None`.

1. Potential error locations:
- The bug is likely caused by the assumption that `cols` will always be provided, leading to incorrect SQL syntax generation.

3. The bug is causing the failing test `test_s3_copy_with_nonetype_columns` to fail because when `columns` is `None`, the `colnames` variable remains an empty string in the `cursor.execute` call, causing the SQL statement to be invalid.

4. Strategy for fixing the bug:
- Check if `self.columns` is not `None` before generating the `colnames` string.
- Modify the SQL generation logic to handle the case when `self.columns` is `None`.

5. Corrected version of the `copy` function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns is not None and len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

With this corrected version, the `colnames` will only be generated if `self.columns` is not `None`, preventing the bug that caused the failing test.
