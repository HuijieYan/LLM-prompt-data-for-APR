### Analysis:
The buggy function `copy` in the `redshift.py` file is responsible for copying data from S3 into Redshift. The bug seems to be related to the formatting of the SQL string passed to `cursor.execute()`. The issue might be due to incorrect indentation or formatting of the SQL query.

### Bug:
The bug in the `copy` function is likely due to the incorrect formatting of the SQL query string when calling `cursor.execute()`. The multiline SQL query might not have the proper indentation, leading to syntax errors when executing the query.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug:
1. Ensure that the multiline SQL query string is properly formatted with correct indentation.
2. Check for any missing or extra whitespaces that might be causing syntax errors.
3. Use string formatting methods to construct the query string with placeholders for variables.

### Corrected Version of the `copy` Function:
```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from S3 into Redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    query = """
    COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
    CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
    {options}
    ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options
    )

    cursor.execute(query)
```

By correcting the formatting of the multiline SQL query and using proper string formatting, the bug in the `copy` function should be resolved. This corrected version should pass the failing test.
