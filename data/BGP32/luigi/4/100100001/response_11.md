The bug in the provided `copy` function is due to the `colnames` variable being initialized as an empty string at the beginning of the function and then conditionally modified. In the failing test, the `colnames` parameter is expected to be an empty string if the `columns` parameter is `None`, but since the buggy function always includes parentheses even when `columns` is `None`, it causes the test to fail.

To fix this bug, we need to update the logic around constructing the `colnames` string to correctly handle the case when `columns` is `None`.

Here is the corrected version of the `copy` function:

```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: luigi/contrib/redshift.py

def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns is not None and len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

With this correction, the `colnames` parameter will only include parentheses when `self.columns` is not `None` and not empty. This will ensure that the function behaves correctly according to the expectation in the failing test.
