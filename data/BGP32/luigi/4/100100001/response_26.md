## Analysis:
1. The `copy` function in the `RedshiftTarget` class defined in `luigi/contrib/redshift.py` is aimed at inserting a file into Redshift.
2. The test function in `test/contrib/redshift_test.py` is testing the behavior of the `copy` function with `None` columns.
3. The `colnames` variable is constructed based on the `columns` attribute of the `RedshiftTarget` class, which is passed as `None` in the test. If `columns` is `None`, an empty string is expected for `colnames`.
4. The string formatting in the `cursor.execute` call might lead to issues if any value is `None` or not properly formatted.

## Bug Cause:
- The `colnames` variable is generated using the `columns` attribute, but if `columns` is `None`, the join operation would cause an error due to attempting to iterate over `None`.

## Bug Fix:
- To fix the bug, we need to handle the case when `self.columns` is `None` and assign an empty string to `colnames` in that scenario.

## Corrected Function:
```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

By making this change, the `colnames` variable will be empty when `self.columns` is `None`, preventing the join operation from causing any errors. This correction should allow the `copy` function to handle `None` columns as expected.
