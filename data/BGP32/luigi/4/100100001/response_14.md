### Analysis:
The buggy function `copy` in `luigi/contrib/redshift.py` is supposed to define the process of copying data from S3 into Redshift. The function constructs a SQL `COPY` command based on the provided parameters and executes it using the cursor.

### Bug Identification:
The bug in the `copy` function seems to be related to the construction of the `colnames` variable. If the `columns` attribute is None (as in the failing test case), the function fails to handle this scenario correctly, resulting in an incorrect SQL statement.

### Bug Explanation:
In the failing test `test_s3_copy_with_nonetype_columns`, the `columns` attribute is set to None for the `DummyS3CopyToTableKey` task. This causes the `colnames` variable in the `copy` function to remain an empty string. However, the buggy function does not handle this case properly when constructing the SQL `COPY` command, leading to a non-matching expected SQL statement.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to introduce a conditional check to handle the case when `self.columns` is None. If `self.columns` is None, we should skip constructing the column names part in the SQL `COPY` command.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames) if colnames else ''

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

### Summary:
The corrected version of the `copy` function now properly handles the case where `self.columns` is None. By checking if `self.columns` is not None before constructing the `colnames` part of the SQL `COPY` command, we ensure that the function behaves correctly in scenarios where column names are not provided. This fix should make the function compatible with the failing test case.
