The bug in the provided `copy` function is related to the incorrect handling of column names when they are not provided (i.e., when `self.columns` is None or an empty list). The buggy function tries to construct the `colnames` variable by joining the column names, but it does not account for the case when there are no columns to join. This leads to a syntax error in the generated SQL `COPY` statement.

To fix the bug, we need to check if `self.columns` is not None and has elements before constructing the `colnames` string. If `self.columns` is None or empty, we should set `colnames` to an empty string, without attempting to join any column names.

Here is the corrected version of the `copy` function:

```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: luigi/contrib/redshift.py

def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    if not colnames:  # handle case when no columns are provided
        colnames = ''

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

With this correction, the `colnames` variable will be set to an empty string when there are no columns provided, preventing the syntax error in the SQL statement. This corrected version should now pass the failing test described in the question.
