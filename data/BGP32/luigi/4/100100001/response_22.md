The bug in the `copy` function lies in the construction of the `colnames` variable. When `self.columns` is empty (None) or has a length of 0, the `colnames` variable should remain an empty string. However, in the buggy code, the `colnames` variable is constructed with parentheses even when there are no columns.

To fix this bug, we need to adjust how `colnames` is constructed based on whether `self.columns` is empty or not. We can check if `self.columns` is empty and only construct `colnames` with parentheses if there are columns present.

Here is the corrected version of the `copy` function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

This corrected version will handle the case where `self.columns` is empty gracefully by not unnecessarily adding parentheses to `colnames`. This should resolve the bug and make the function work correctly with the provided test case.
