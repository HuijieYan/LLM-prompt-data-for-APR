The bug in the copy function lies in the way the colnames variable is being handled. If the columns list is empty or None, the colnames variable is not being set properly, leading to incorrect formatting in the SQL query.

To fix this bug, we need to ensure that colnames is correctly handled even when the columns list is empty or None.

Here is the corrected version of the copy function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns:  # check if columns is not None and not empty
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

This corrected version ensures that colnames is set correctly even if the columns list is empty or None. This should fix the bug and make the function work as expected when running the failing test.
