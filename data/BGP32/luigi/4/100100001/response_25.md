The bug in the provided code seems to be related to the `colnames` variable being set incorrectly when `self.columns` is `None` or empty. This leads to a misplaced comma in the `COPY` statement, causing the test to fail.

To fix this bug, we need to handle the case when `self.columns` is `None` or empty by skipping the creation of the `colnames` string.

Here is the corrected version of the `copy` function:

```python
# The relative path of the fixed file: luigi/contrib/redshift.py

def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )

```

With this correction, the `colnames` variable will only be set if `self.columns` is not `None` and has a length greater than 0. This will ensure that the `colnames` string is formatted correctly in the `COPY` statement.

Running the failing test should now pass with this corrected version of the `copy` function.
