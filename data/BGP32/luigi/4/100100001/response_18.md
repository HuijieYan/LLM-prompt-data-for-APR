## Analysis:
1. The buggy function `copy` in `luigi/contrib/redshift.py` is responsible for defining the copying process from S3 into Redshift.
2. The function constructs a SQL COPY statement using the provided table, column names, source, credentials, and copy options.
3. The potential error in the function could be related to the construction of the `colnames` variable when `self.columns` is None. This might cause issues when formatting the COPY statement.
4. The failing test `test_s3_copy_with_nonetype_columns` creates a DummyS3CopyToTableKey task with `columns=None` and expects the `COPY` statement with no column names to be executed.
5. To fix the bug, we need to handle the case when `self.columns` is None to construct the `colnames` variable properly and ensure that the `COPY` statement is generated correctly.

## Bug Cause:
The bug occurs because the function does not handle the case when `self.columns` is None. This leads to an empty `colnames` string being added to the `COPY` statement, which results in incorrect formatting.

## Fix:
To fix the bug, we should check if `self.columns` is None and set `colnames` accordingly to avoid empty string concatenation.

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from S3 into Redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

By adding the check `if self.columns:` before constructing `colnames`, we ensure that the `colnames` variable is set correctly even when `self.columns` is None.

This fix will address the bug and allow the corrected version of the `copy` function to pass the failing test `test_s3_copy_with_nonetype_columns`.
