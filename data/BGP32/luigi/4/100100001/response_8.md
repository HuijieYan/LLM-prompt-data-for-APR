The bug in the `copy` function is caused by the way the `colnames` variable is handled when there are no columns provided. In the current implementation, if `self.columns` is empty, the `colnames` variable remains an empty string, resulting in incorrect formatting of the `COPY` statement.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the way `colnames` is handled when there are no columns. Instead of skipping the column names when there are no columns provided, we should include an empty string for `colnames` in the `COPY` statement.

Here is the corrected version of the `copy` function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ""
    if self.columns:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

This corrected version handles the case when there are no columns provided by including an empty string for `colnames` in the `COPY` statement. This change ensures that the `COPY` statement is correctly formatted even when there are no columns.
