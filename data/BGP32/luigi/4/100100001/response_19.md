The bug in the provided `copy` function is caused by the `colnames` variable being initialized as an empty string `''` and not having a space before it when concatenated in the SQL query. This leads to incorrect formatting in the `COPY` statement and causes the failing test to fail.

To fix this bug, the `colnames` variable should be checked if it is empty before adding it to the SQL query, and if it is not empty, a comma should be added after it to maintain the correct syntax in the SQL query.

Here is the corrected version of the `copy` function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    if colnames:
        colnames = ' ' + colnames   # Adding a space before colnames if it is not empty

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table}{colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

With this correction, the `colnames` variable will be formatted correctly in the SQL query, passing the failing test.
