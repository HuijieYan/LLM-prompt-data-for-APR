The bug in the `copy` function is caused by the incorrect formatting of the SQL query string in the `cursor.execute` method. The `colnames` variable is not being properly handled when it is empty.

To fix this bug, you need to ensure that the `colnames` variable is properly formatted and handled even when it is empty.

Here is the corrected version of the `copy` function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

With this correction, the `colnames` variable will be properly handled regardless of whether it is empty or not. This corrected version of the function should pass the failing test.
