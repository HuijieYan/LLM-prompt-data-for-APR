The bug in the provided `copy` function is related to the formatting of the `COPY` SQL statement. The function constructs a multi-line SQL statement to copy data from S3 into Redshift, but due to the incorrect indentation level, the `COPY` statement does not align properly with the rest of the code.

To fix this bug, we need to ensure the proper indentation for the multi-line SQL statement within the `execute` call. By adjusting the indentation of the `COPY` statement, we can resolve this issue.

Here is the corrected version of the `copy` function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

After applying this correction, the `COPY` statement will align correctly and should now pass the failing test provided.
