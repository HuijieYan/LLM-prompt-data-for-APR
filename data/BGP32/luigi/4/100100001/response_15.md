The bug in the `copy` function arises from the fact that the formatting of the SQL query in the `cursor.execute` call is not handling the case where `colnames` is empty correctly. When `colnames` is empty, there should be no comma after the `COPY` statement in the SQL query.

To fix this bug, we can check if `colnames` is empty and only include it in the `COPY` statement if it is not empty.

Here is the corrected version of the `copy` function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    
    if len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    copy_query = """
    COPY {table}{colnames} from '{source}'
    CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
    {options}
    ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=' ' + colnames if colnames else '',
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options
    )

    cursor.execute(copy_query)
```

With this correction, the SQL query will be formed correctly even when `colnames` is empty, and the test provided should pass without any issues.
