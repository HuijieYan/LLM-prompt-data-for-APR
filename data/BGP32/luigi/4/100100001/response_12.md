## Analysis:
- The `copy` function in the `luigi.contrib.redshift.py` file is responsible for defining the copying operation from an S3 source into a Redshift table.
- The function constructs and executes a SQL `COPY` command to load data.
- The `test_s3_copy_with_nonetype_columns` test function in the `redshift_test.py` file is mocking the `RedshiftTarget` and `cursor`, and then checking if the expected `COPY` command is executed.
- The bug seems to be related to handling the case where `self.columns` is `None`.
- In the buggy function, if `self.columns` is empty (i.e., `None`), the `colnames` variable is not correctly handled in the SQL statement, potentially causing SQL syntax errors.

## Bug Cause:
- The bug occurs due to the handling of `None` in the `self.columns` list.
- When `self.columns` is `None`, the code does not check for this case and directly tries to construct `colnames` from it.
- This results in an empty `colnames` variable in the SQL statement, which can lead to incorrect formatting and syntax errors in the `COPY` command.

## Bug Fix:
To fix the bug, we need to handle the case where `self.columns` is `None` appropriately and ensure that the `colnames` variable is generated correctly in the `COPY` statement.

## Corrected Version:
```python
    def copy(self, cursor, f):
        """
        Defines copying from S3 into Redshift.
    
        If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
        """
        logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
        colnames = ''
        if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:
            colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
            colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)
    
        cursor.execute("""
         COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
         CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
         {options}
         ;""".format(
            table=self.table,
            colnames=colnames,
            source=f,
            creds=self._credentials(),
            options=self.copy_options)
        )
```

In the corrected version, we check if `self.columns` is not `None` before trying to construct `colnames`. This ensures that if `self.columns` is `None`, the SQL statement is formatted correctly without causing syntax errors. The corrected version should now pass the failing test.
