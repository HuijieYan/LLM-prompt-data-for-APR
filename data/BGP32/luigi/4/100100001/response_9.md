### Analysis:
The `copy` function in `luigi/contrib/redshift.py` is responsible for executing a `COPY` command to load data from S3 into Redshift. The buggy function is not correctly handling cases where no columns are provided (`columns=None`), resulting in incorrect SQL generation.

### Bug Location:
The bug occurs in the code segment where `colnames` is generated based on the provided columns. When `self.columns` is empty (meaning no columns are provided), `colnames` should be empty as well. However, the current implementation retains a comma at the beginning when `self.columns` is empty.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is caused by the incorrect handling of the `colnames` variable when no columns are provided. The function does not properly check for this edge case, resulting in invalid SQL syntax when constructing the `COPY` command.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, it is necessary to ensure that when no columns are provided, `colnames` remains empty. This can be achieved by adjusting the generation of the `colnames` string based on the presence of columns. Additionally, the SQL query formatting should be reviewed to ensure correctness.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from S3 into Redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

By making this adjustment in the `copy` function, the SQL generation logic correctly handles the case where no columns are provided, ensuring the proper execution of the `COPY` command.
