## Explanation:
The bug in the `copy` function is due to the incorrect handling of the `colnames` variable. When `self.columns` is `None` or empty, the `colnames` variable should be an empty string. However, the current implementation assigns this conditional value only if `len(self.columns) > 0`, causing `colnames` to be uninitialized when `self.columns` is `None`.

## Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix this bug, we need to set `colnames` to an empty string when `self.columns` is `None` or empty.

## Corrected Version of the Function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

After applying the correction presented above, the function should handle the `colnames` variable correctly and pass the failing test.
