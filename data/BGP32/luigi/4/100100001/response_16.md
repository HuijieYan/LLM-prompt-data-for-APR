## Explanation:
The issue in the buggy function lies in the way the `colnames` variable is constructed. In the `copy` function, if there are no columns provided (when `self.columns` is an empty list), the `colnames` variable remains an empty string. However, in the `cursor.execute` statement, the parentheses for the column names are added unconditionally, leading to a syntax error in the SQL query.

## Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the parentheses for the column names are only added when there are columns present. This can be achieved by checking the length of `self.columns` before constructing the `colnames` variable with the parentheses.

## Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

After applying this correction, the `colnames` variable will now be constructed with parentheses only if there are columns present, resolving the syntax error in the SQL query and allowing the function to execute successfully for the provided test case.
