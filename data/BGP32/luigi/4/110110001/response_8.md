### Analysis:
- The buggy function is `copy()` within the `S3CopyToTable` class.
- The failing test case is `test_s3_copy_with_nonetype_columns` in the `RedshiftTest` class.
- The error message indicates a `TypeError` due to trying to call `len()` on a `NoneType` object.
- The cause of the bug is that the `columns` attribute is expected to be a list, but it is set to `None`, causing the `TypeError`.
- The strategy for fixing the bug is to handle the case when `self.columns` is `None` to prevent calling `len()` on it.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

By adding a check for `self.columns` before trying to access its length, we ensure that the code does not break when `columns` is `None`. This correction will prevent the `TypeError` and allow the function to execute correctly even when `columns` is not provided.
