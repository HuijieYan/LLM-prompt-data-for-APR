### Analysis:
1. The `copy` function within the `S3CopyToTable` class is trying to access the `self.columns` attribute, which is expected to be a list based on the class docs. However, in the failing test, the `columns` attribute is set to `None`. This results in a `TypeError` when trying to check the length of `self.columns` within the `copy` function.
2. The code should handle the case when `self.columns` is `None` to prevent this error.
3. The failing test is trying to run the `task.run()` method, which calls the `copy` function with `columns=None`. The failing test provides the expected `COPY` query as a multiline string with colnames set to an empty string.
4. A strategy for fixing the bug would be to explicitly handle the case when `self.columns` is `None` within the `copy` function, so that the `len()` function is not called on a `NoneType` object.
5. The corrected version of the code should include a condition to check if `self.columns` is `None` in order to avoid the `TypeError`.

### Bug Fix:
```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns is not None: # Check if self.columns is not None
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

By adding the condition `if self.columns is not None:` before processing `self.columns`, we ensure that the `len()` function is not called on a `NoneType` object, resolving the `TypeError` in this case. This corrected version of the function should now handle the scenario where `self.columns` is `None` without causing any errors.
