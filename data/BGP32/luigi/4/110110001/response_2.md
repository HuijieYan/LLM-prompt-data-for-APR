### Analysis:
1. The error occurs at `if len(self.columns) > 0:` line within the `copy` function of the `S3CopyToTable` class.
2. The error is a `TypeError` because the `self.columns` attribute is `None`, and we cannot use the `len()` function on a `None` object.
3. The failing test `test_s3_copy_with_nonetype_columns` creates an instance of `DummyS3CopyToTableKey` with the `columns` attribute set to `None`, which leads to the `TypeError` when the `copy` function is called.
4. To fix the bug, we should check if `self.columns` is not `None` before trying to get its length. This can be done using `if self.columns is not None:` before checking its length.
5. A corrected version of the `copy` function is provided below.

### Corrected Version:
```python
    def copy(self, cursor, f):
        """
        Defines copying from s3 into redshift.
    
        If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
        """
        logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
        colnames = ''
        
        if self.columns is not None and len(self.columns) > 0:
            colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
            colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)
    
        cursor.execute("""
         COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
         CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
         {options}
         ;""".format(
            table=self.table,
            colnames=colnames,
            source=f,
            creds=self._credentials(),
            options=self.copy_options)
        )
``` 

By adding the `if self.columns is not None and` condition before checking the length of `self.columns`, we ensure that the code does not throw a `TypeError` when `self.columns` is `None`.
