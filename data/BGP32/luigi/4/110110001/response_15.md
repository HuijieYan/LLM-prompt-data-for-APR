### Analysis:
1. **Buggy Function**: The `copy` function within the `S3CopyToTable` class in the `luigi/contrib/redshift.py` file is causing the error.
   
2. **Error Location**: The error is occurring at the line where the length of `self.columns` is being checked.
   
3. **Cause of Bug**: The error occurs because the `columns` attribute is set to `None` when creating the `DummyS3CopyToTableKey` object. It then tries to check the length of `None`, which results in a `TypeError`.
   
4. **Fix Strategy**: To fix this bug, we need to include a check for `None` before checking the length of `self.columns`.

### Correction:
```python
    def copy(self, cursor, f):
        """
        Defines copying from s3 into redshift.
    
        If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
        """
        logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
        colnames = ''
        if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:
            colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
            colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)
    
        cursor.execute("""
         COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
         CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
         {options}
         ;""".format(
            table=self.table,
            colnames=colnames,
            source=f,
            creds=self._credentials(),
            options=self.copy_options)
        )
```

By adding the condition `if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:` before checking the length of `self.columns`, we ensure that the code does not try to process `None` values, preventing the `TypeError` from occurring.
