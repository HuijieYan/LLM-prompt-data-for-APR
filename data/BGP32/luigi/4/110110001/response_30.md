### Analysis:
1. The `copy` method in the `S3CopyToTable` class is expecting `self.columns` to be a list, but in the failing test `columns` is being passed as `None`.
2. The bug is caused by trying to check the length of `None` in the `copy` method, leading to a `TypeError`.
3. The error message indicates that `len(self.columns)` is causing the `TypeError` because `self.columns` is of type `None`.
4. To fix this bug, we need to check if `self.columns` is `None` before trying to compute its length and handle the case of `columns` being `None`.
5. If `columns` is `None`, we should skip generating the column names while constructing the query.

### Solution:
Below is the corrected version of the `copy` method:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns is not None:  # Added check for None
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} FROM '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

With this change, the code will first check if `self.columns` is `None` before trying to compute its length, avoiding the `TypeError` that was occurring.
