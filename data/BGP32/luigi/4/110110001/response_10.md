### Analysis:
- The `copy` function in the `S3CopyToTable` class does not handle the case where `self.columns` could be `None`.
- Due to the check `if len(self.columns) > 0:`, if `self.columns` is `None`, it raises a `TypeError` due to trying to get the length of `None`.
- The failing test is attempting to run the task `DummyS3CopyToTableKey` with `columns=None`, triggering the error within the `copy` function due to the `if len(self.columns) > 0:` condition.

### Bug Cause:
- The bug is caused by the assumption that `self.columns` will always be a non-empty list, leading to a `TypeError` when `columns=None` in the failing test.

### Fix Strategy:
- To fix this bug, we need to modify the `copy` function to handle the case where `self.columns` is `None`, possibly by checking if it is `None` first before attempting to get its length.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.
    
    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

After applying the corrected version of the `copy` function as shown above, it will handle the case where `self.columns` is `None`, preventing the `TypeError`. The corrected version should now pass the failing test without any issues.
