### Bug Analysis:
- The buggy function `copy` in the `S3CopyToTable` class is attempting to check the length of the `self.columns` attribute, but it fails when `self.columns` is `None`.
- The failing test `test_s3_copy_with_nonetype_columns` tries to create an instance of `DummyS3CopyToTableKey` with `columns` set to `None`, which triggers the bug in the `copy` function.
- The error message specifically points out that a `TypeError` occurs due to trying to get the length of a `NoneType` object.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
- To fix the bug, we need to handle the case when `self.columns` is `None` before trying to access its length.
- One way to resolve this issue is to check if `self.columns` is not `None` before proceeding with the code that depends on its length.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    
    if self.columns is not None:  # Added check to handle NoneType
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
    COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
    CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
    {options}
    ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

### After applying this fix, the corrected version of the `copy` function will handle the case when `self.columns` is `None` and prevent the `TypeError` that was occurring. The corrected version will pass the failing test successfully.
