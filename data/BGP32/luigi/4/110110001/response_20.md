## Analysis:
1. The buggy function `copy` in the `S3CopyToTable` class is expecting `self.columns` to be a list, but in the failing test, the `columns` attribute is set to `None`, causing a `TypeError`.
2. The error occurs when trying to determine the length of `self.columns`, which is `None` in the failing test.
3. The root cause of the bug is that the `copy` function assumes `self.columns` will always be a list, but it is not handling the case where `self.columns` is `None`.
4. To fix the bug, we need to add a check to see if `self.columns` is `None` and handle it appropriately by setting `colnames` accordingly.

## Bug Fix:
```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns is not None:  # Check if self.columns is not None
        if len(self.columns) > 0:
            colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
            colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

By adding a check to see if `self.columns` is not `None`, we prevent the `TypeError` that was occurring when trying to get the length of `None`. This fixed version of the function will pass the failing test.
