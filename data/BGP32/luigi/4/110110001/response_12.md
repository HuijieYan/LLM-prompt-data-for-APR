### Analysis:
1. Buggy Function: The `copy` function inside the `S3CopyToTable` class from the `luigi/contrib/redshift.py` file is buggy.
2. Error Location: The error occurs in the `copy` function when trying to check the length of the `columns` attribute which is `None`.
3. Cause of the Bug:
   - The `columns` attribute is being checked for its length, but when it is `None`, it raises a `TypeError` as `NoneType` has no length.
   - The failing test `test_s3_copy_with_nonetype_columns` is mocking the scenario where `columns` is `None` but the buggy function does not handle this case.
4. Bug Fix Strategy:
   - We need to handle the case where `columns` is `None` in the `copy` function to avoid the `TypeError`.
   - We will modify the `copy` function to handle the scenario where `columns` is `None`, ensuring that the logic works correctly in that case.
  
### Corrected Version:
```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns is not None and len(self.columns) > 0:  # Check for None before getting length
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

After fixing the buggy function as shown above, it should be able to handle the scenario where `columns` is `None`, and the corrected version will pass the failing test.
