### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `copy` inside the `S3CopyToTable` class expects `self.columns` to be a list, and it tries to get the length of the list to determine if any columns are provided.
2. The failing test (`test_s3_copy_with_nonetype_columns`) creates an instance of `DummyS3CopyToTableKey` with `columns=None`, which causes a `TypeError` when the buggy function is executed due to trying to get the length of a `NoneType` object.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is caused by the assumption in the `copy` function that `self.columns` will always be a list. When `columns=None` is passed to the task, it results in `self.columns` being assigned as `None`, leading to a `TypeError` when trying to get its length (`len(self.columns)`).

### Bug Fix:
To fix the bug, we need to check if `self.columns` is `None` before trying to get its length. If it is `None`, we can set `colnames` to an empty string directly.

### Corrected Function:
```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns is not None:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

By adding the `if self.columns is not None` check before trying to operate on `self.columns`, we ensure that the corrected function can handle `None` values for `self.columns` and avoid the `TypeError`.
