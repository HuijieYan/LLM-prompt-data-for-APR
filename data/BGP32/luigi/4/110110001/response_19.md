### Bug Analysis:
The buggy function `copy` within the `S3CopyToTable` class is trying to check the length of `self.columns`, which is expected to be a list of columns. However, in the failing test `test_s3_copy_with_nonetype_columns`, the `columns` attribute is set to `None`, leading to a `TypeError` when trying to check the length of `None`.

### Bug Location:
The bug is located in the `copy` function when checking the length of `self.columns`.

### Cause of the Bug:
The `columns` attribute should be a list of columns. When it is set to `None` in the test, it leads to an error because `None` does not have a length.

### Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we can check if `self.columns` is not `None` before trying to access its length.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns is not None and len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

After applying this correction, the `copy` function will first check if `self.columns` is not `None` before proceeding to check its length, thus preventing the `TypeError` encountered in the failing test case.
