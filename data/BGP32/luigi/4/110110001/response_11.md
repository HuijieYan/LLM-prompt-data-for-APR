### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `copy` in the `S3CopyToTable` class is trying to check the length of `self.columns`, which is expected to be a list. However, in the failing test, the `columns` attribute is set to `None`, causing a `TypeError` when trying to check the length of `None`.
2. The error message clearly states that `object of type 'NoneType' has no len()`, indicating that the `self.columns` attribute is `None`.
### Bug Cause:
The bug is caused by the `columns` attribute being set to `None` in the failing test, which leads to a `TypeError` when trying to get the length of `None`.
### Bug Fix:
To fix this bug, we can add a null check before trying to get the length of `self.columns` in the `copy` function. This will prevent the `TypeError` when `self.columns` is `None`.
### Corrected Version:
```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
    COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
    CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
    {options}
    ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
``` 

By adding a null check `if self.columns` before checking the length, we ensure that the code won't try to get the length of `None`, fixing the bug.
