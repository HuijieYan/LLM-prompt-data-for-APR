### Analysis:
1. The buggy function is the `copy` method inside the `S3CopyToTable` class in the `luigi/contrib/redshift.py` file.
2. The failing test `test_s3_copy_with_nonetype_columns` is trying to test the behavior of the task when `columns` attribute is set to `None`.
3. The error message indicates a `TypeError` caused by trying to get the `len()` of a `None` type object.
4. The bug is happening because the code is trying to check the length of `self.columns` without handling the case when `self.columns` is `None`. The expectation is that the function should handle the case when `columns` is `None`.
5. The bug can be fixed by modifying the if condition to specifically check if `self.columns` is not `None` before trying to get its length.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
Modify the condition from `if len(self.columns) > 0:` to `if self.columns is not None and len(self.columns) > 0:` to handle the case when `columns` is `None`.

### Corrected Version of the `copy` function:
```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
        """
        Defines copying from s3 into redshift.
    
        If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
        """
        logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
        colnames = ''
        if self.columns is not None and len(self.columns) > 0:
            colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
            colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)
    
        cursor.execute("""
         COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
         CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
         {options}
         ;""".format(
            table=self.table,
            colnames=colnames,
            source=f,
            creds=self._credentials(),
            options=self.copy_options)
        )
```

By making this change, the corrected version of the `copy` function will be able to handle the case when `columns` is `None` and pass the failing test successfully.
