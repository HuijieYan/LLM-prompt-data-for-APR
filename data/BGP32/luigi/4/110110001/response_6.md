### Potential Error Locations:
1. The `if len(self.columns) > 0:` statement in the `copy` function could raise an error when `self.columns` is `None`.
   
### Cause of the Bug:
The failing test `test_s3_copy_with_nonetype_columns` creates an instance of `DummyS3CopyToTableKey` with `columns=None`. The `copy` function in the `S3CopyToTable` class tries to check the length of `self.columns` without handling the case where `self.columns` is `None`. This leads to a `TypeError` when trying to call `len()` on a `NoneType`.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we can add a check to ensure that `self.columns` is not `None` before trying to access its length. This will prevent the `TypeError` from occurring.

### Corrected Version of the `copy` Function:
```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

By adding the `if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:` check, we ensure that the length of `self.columns` is only accessed when `self.columns` is not `None`. This modification will prevent the `TypeError` encountered in the failing test.
