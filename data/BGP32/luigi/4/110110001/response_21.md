### Bug Analysis:
1. The function `copy` in the `S3CopyToTable` class is throwing a `TypeError` when `self.columns` is `None`.
2. The error occurs because the code does not check if `self.columns` is `None` before trying to get its length.
3. The failing test is trying to run a task (`DummyS3CopyToTableKey`) with `columns=None`, causing the error in the `copy` function.
4. The fix involves adding a check to see if `self.columns` is `None` before trying to get its length.

### Bug Fix:
```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    
    if self.columns is None:
        colnames = ''
    else:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

By adding the conditional check to see if `self.columns` is `None`, the function will handle the case properly and not try to get the length of a `NoneType` object. This fix should resolve the `TypeError` encountered in the `copy` function.
