### Analysis:
- The function `copy` in the `S3CopyToTable` class is expecting the `self.columns` attribute to be a list, but the test case is passing `None` as the value for `columns`.
- This causes an error when calling `len(self.columns)` which leads to `TypeError: object of type 'NoneType' has no len()`.

### Strategy for fixing the bug:
- Update the `copy` function to handle the case when `self.columns` is `None`.
- Check if `self.columns` is `None` before trying to iterate over it.

### Corrected version of the function:
```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

This corrected version checks if `self.columns` is not `None` before proceeding to check its length. This change should fix the bug and allow the function to run successfully with `None` assigned to `columns`.
