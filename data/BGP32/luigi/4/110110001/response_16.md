### Analysis:
1. The buggy function is `copy` within the `S3CopyToTable` class in the `luigi/contrib/redshift.py` file. 
2. The test function that fails due to this buggy function is `test_s3_copy_with_nonetype_columns` in the `test/contrib/redshift_test.py` file.
3. The error message indicates a `TypeError` due to trying to get the length of a `NoneType` object within the `copy` function when checking the length of `self.columns`.
4. The cause of the bug is that the `copy` function is assuming that `self.columns` is always a list but it can be `None` as well. This assumption leads to an error when trying to check the length of `None`.
5. To fix the bug, we need to add a check to handle the case when `self.columns` is `None` before trying to get the length.

### Fix:
```python
    def copy(self, cursor, f):
        """
        Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

        If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
        """
        logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
        colnames = ''   
        if self.columns:  # Check if self.columns is not None
            colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns]) 
            colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

        cursor.execute("""
         COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
         CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
         {options}
         ;""".format(
            table=self.table,
            colnames=colnames,
            source=f,
            creds=self._credentials(),
            options=self.copy_options)
        )
```

By adding the check `if self.columns:` before accessing the length of `self.columns`, we can avoid the `TypeError` when `self.columns` is `None`. This fix ensures that the `copy` function behaves correctly even when `self.columns` is not provided.
