### Analysis:
1. The buggy function is part of the class `S3CopyToTable` which inherits from two parent classes: `rdbms.CopyToTable` and `_CredentialsMixin`.
2. The failing test `test_s3_copy_with_nonetype_columns` is trying to test the behavior of the `copy` method when `self.columns` is `None`.
3. The error occurs when trying to check the length of `self.columns` which is `None`, resulting in a `TypeError`.
4. To fix the bug, we need to handle the case when `self.columns` is `None` before checking its length.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
We should add a condition to check if `self.columns` is `None` and handle this case appropriately to avoid the `TypeError`.

### Corrected Version of the `copy` method:
```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    if self.columns:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)
    else:
        colnames = ''
    
    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

By adding the check `if self.columns:` before operating on `self.columns`, we ensure that the code does not try to get the length of a `None` type object. This should fix the bug and make the test pass.
