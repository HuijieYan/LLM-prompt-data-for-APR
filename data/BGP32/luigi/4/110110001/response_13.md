### Analysis:
- The `S3CopyToTable` class has a `copy` function that is responsible for copying data from S3 into Redshift.
- The failing test `test_s3_copy_with_nonetype_columns` checks if the `copy` function is correctly handling the case where the `columns` attribute is `None`.
- The error message indicates a `TypeError` caused by trying to get the length of `None`.

### Error Location:
- The cause of the error is when attempting to check the length of `self.columns` when `self.columns` is `None`.
- The `columns` attribute is not being handled properly in the `copy` function.

### Bug Cause:
- The bug is caused by not accounting for the scenario where `self.columns` is `None`.
- This results in a `TypeError` when the code tries to call `len` on `None`.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
- Before attempting to get the length of `self.columns`, we need to check if `self.columns` is `None`.
- If `self.columns` is `None`, we will not try to process it further to avoid the `TypeError`.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    
    colnames = ''
    
    if self.columns is not None and len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

By adding an additional check to ensure that `self.columns` is not `None` before trying to get its length, we can avoid the `TypeError` and fix the bug in the `copy` function.
