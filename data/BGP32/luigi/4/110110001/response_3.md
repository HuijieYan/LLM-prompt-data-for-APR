### Analysis:
1. **Buggy Function**: The `copy` function within the `S3CopyToTable` class is supposed to define the copying process from S3 into Redshift. However, it contains a bug where the code is checking the length of `self.columns` without properly handling the case where `self.columns` is `None`.
   
2. **Test**: The failing test is testing the case where `columns` is `None`, which triggers the bug in the `copy` function.

3. **Error**: The error message states that a `TypeError` occurred because an object of type `NoneType` has no length. This occurs when trying to check the length of `self.columns` when it is `None`.

### Bug Cause:
- The `copy` function fails when `self.columns` is `None`. The code tries to check the length of `self.columns` without accounting for the case where it might be `None`.
- The failing test explicitly sets `columns` of the `DummyS3CopyToTableKey` task to `None`, triggering the bug in the `copy` function.

### Fix Strategy:
- To fix the bug, we need to handle the case where `self.columns` is `None` before trying to access its length. This can be done by checking if `self.columns` is `None` before attempting to process it.
- We should modify the `copy` function to handle the scenario where `self.columns` is `None` gracefully.

### Corrected Code:
```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    
    if self.columns is not None and len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

By adding a check to ensure `self.columns` is not `None` before accessing its length, we prevent the `TypeError` from occurring. This corrected version of the `copy` function will pass the failing test scenario where `columns` is `None`.
