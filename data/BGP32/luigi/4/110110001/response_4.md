### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `copy(self, cursor, f)` is part of the `S3CopyToTable` class in the `luigi/contrib/redshift.py` file.
2. The failing test `test_s3_copy_with_nonetype_columns` from `test/contrib/redshift_test.py` is checking the behavior of the `copy()` function when `self.columns` is set to `None`.
3. The error message indicates a `TypeError` that occurs when trying to use `len()` function on a `NoneType` object (`self.columns`).
4. The bug is caused by assuming that `self.columns` will always be a list and attempting to compute the length of it without checking for `None` values.
5. To fix the bug, we need to check if `self.columns` is not `None` before performing any operations on it.

### Correction:
```python
class S3CopyToTable(rdbms.CopyToTable, _CredentialsMixin):
    def copy(self, cursor, f):
        logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
        colnames = ''
        if self.columns is not None and len(self.columns) > 0:
            colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
            colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

        cursor.execute("""
         COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
         CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
         {options}
         ;""".format(
            table=self.table,
            colnames=colnames,
            source=f,
            creds=self._credentials(),
            options=self.copy_options)
        )
```

By adding a condition to check if `self.columns` is not `None` before trying to compute its length, we ensure that the operation is only performed on valid data and prevent the `TypeError` from occurring. This corrected version should pass the failing test.
