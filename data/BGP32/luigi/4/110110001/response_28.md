### Analysis:
- The buggy function `copy` in the `S3CopyToTable` class is attempting to check the length of the `columns` attribute, which is causing a `TypeError` when `columns` is `None`.
- This error is likely happening because the `columns` attribute is expected to be a list, but it is not handled properly when it is `None`.
- The failing test is trying to test the scenario where `columns` is `None` and expects the `copy` method to execute without errors.

### Strategy for fixing the bug:
- Update the `copy` method in the `S3CopyToTable` class to handle the case when `columns` is `None`.
- Modify the code to check whether `columns` is `None` before trying to get its length.
- If `columns` is `None`, handle it appropriately to avoid the `TypeError`.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns is not None and len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

By making this change, the `copy` method will handle the case when `columns` is `None` and avoid the `TypeError`. The corrected version should pass the failing test.
