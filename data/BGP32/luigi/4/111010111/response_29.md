### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `copy()` is part of the `S3CopyToTable` class in the `luigi.contrib.redshift.py` file.
2. The error occurs when trying to check the length of `self.columns`, which is `None`, causing a `TypeError`.
3. The expected behavior is to check if `self.columns` is not `None` before trying to get its length.
4. To fix the bug, we need to modify the line where the length of `self.columns` is checked to avoid the `TypeError`.

### Bug:
The bug occurs in the `copy()` function when the length of `self.columns` is being checked without validating if `self.columns` is `None` or has a valid value.

### Fix:
We need to modify the conditional check for `self.columns` to ensure it's not `None` before getting its length.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options())
    )
```

By adding the `self.columns and` check in the `if` condition, we ensure that the length of `self.columns` is only checked when it's not `None`, avoiding the `TypeError` that was occurring.
