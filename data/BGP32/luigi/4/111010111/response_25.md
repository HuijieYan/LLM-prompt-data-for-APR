## Analysis
1. The buggy function `copy` in the `S3CopyToTable` class is throwing a `TypeError: object of type 'NoneType' has no len()` error.
   
2. The cause of the bug is that the code attempts to check the length of `self.columns` without validating if `self.columns` is not None, which results in the error when `self.columns` is None.

3. The `copy` function is trying to construct a SQL query using `self.columns` to get column names. But if `self.columns` is None, it should not attempt to construct the column names.

4. To fix this bug, we need to add a check to ensure that `self.columns` is not None before trying to access its length. If `self.columns` is not None, then we proceed to construct the column names for the SQL query.

5. Below is the corrected version of the `copy` function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns is not None and len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options())
    )
```

By adding the check `if self.columns is not None` before checking the length, we prevent the `TypeError` from occurring when `self.columns` is None. This fix ensures that the function handles the case where `self.columns` is None appropriately.
