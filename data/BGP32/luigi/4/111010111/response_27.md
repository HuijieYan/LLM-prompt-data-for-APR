## Analysis
1. The buggy function `copy` in the `S3CopyToTable` class is trying to check the length of `self.columns` which is causing an error when `self.columns` is `None`.
2. The error message indicates a `TypeError: object of type 'NoneType' has no len()`.
3. The expected behavior is to handle the case where `self.columns` is `None` and not throw an error.
4. A suggested strategy for fixing the bug is to check if `self.columns` is not None before attempting to get its length.

## Correction
Here is the corrected version of the `copy` function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

This correction adds an additional check `if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:` to ensure that `self.columns` is not `None` before trying to get its length. This change will prevent the `TypeError` when `self.columns` is `None`.
