### Analysis

1. The buggy function is `copy` within the `S3CopyToTable` class in the `luigi.contrib.redshift` module.
2. The error occurs at line 338 where the length of `self.columns` is checked. The error seems to be due to `self.columns` being `None`.
3. The error is triggered because when `self.columns` is `None`, trying to check its length using `len()` results in a `TypeError`.
4. To fix the bug, we can modify the condition to first check if `self.columns` is not `None` before checking its length.
5. Below is the corrected version of the function.

### Corrected Version

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:  # Check if self.columns is not None before checking its length
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options())
    )
```

By making the modification to first check if `self.columns` is not `None`, the `TypeError` should be resolved, and the function should work correctly, passing the failing test case.
