## Analysis
1. The buggy function `copy` is part of the `S3CopyToTable` class within the `luigi/contrib/redshift.py` file. The function is responsible for copying data from S3 into Redshift.
2. The error occurs when the function tries to check the length of `self.columns`, which is `None` during the failing test.
3. The bug is caused by the fact that the function does not handle the case where `self.columns` is `None`, leading to a `TypeError` when trying to get its length.
4. To fix the bug, we need to check if `self.columns` is not `None` before getting its length. We should update the condition to `if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0` to handle the `None` case.
5. The corrected version of the function should perform this additional check.

## Corrected Version
```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:  # Check if self.columns is not None before getting its length
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} FROM '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

By updating the condition to check for `self.columns` being not `None`, we ensure that the code won't raise a `TypeError` when trying to get the length of `self.columns`. This correction resolves the issue reported on GitHub and ensures the function handles the case where `self.columns` is `None`.
