## Bug Fix Strategy
The bug occurs due to an error in checking the length of `self.columns` when it is `None`. To fix this bug, we need to update the condition to first check if `self.columns` is not `None` before attempting to get its length.

## The corrected version of the buggy function

```python
    # this is the corrected version of the buggy function
    def copy(self, cursor, f):
        """
        Defines copying from s3 into redshift.
    
        If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
        """
        logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
        colnames = ''
        if self.columns is not None and len(self.columns) > 0:  # Check if self.columns is not None
            colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
            colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)
    
        cursor.execute("""
         COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
         CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
         {options}
         ;""".format(
            table=self.table,
            colnames=colnames,
            source=f,
            creds=self._credentials(),
            options=self.copy_options)  # Ensure to call the copy_options function to get options
        )
```

By updating the conditional check in the `copy` function to ensure that `self.columns` is not `None` before calculating its length, we avoid the `TypeError` that was occurring when trying to get the length of `NoneType`. This correction aligns with the suggested solution in the GitHub issue and should resolve the bug effectively.
