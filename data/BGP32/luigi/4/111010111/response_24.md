## Bug Analysis:
1. The buggy function `copy` in the `S3CopyToTable` class is trying to check the length of `self.columns`, which is causing the `TypeError: object of type 'NoneType' has no len()` error. This error occurs when `self.columns` is `None`.
2. The error message indicates that the issue is at line 338, where the length of `self.columns` is being checked.
3. The expected input parameters are `cursor`, `f`, and `self`. The `columns` attribute of `self` is `None`, which leads to the error when trying to calculate its length. The expected behavior is for the function to handle `columns` being `None`.
4. To fix this bug, we need to ensure that even if `self.columns` is `None`, the function does not attempt to get its length.

## Fixing the Bug:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options())
    )
```

In the corrected version, we added a check `if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:` to ensure that if `self.columns` is `None`, the length is not checked. This change will prevent the `TypeError` when `self.columns` is `None`.
