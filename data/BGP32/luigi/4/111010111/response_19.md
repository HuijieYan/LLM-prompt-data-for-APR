## Analysis
The buggy function `copy` in the `S3CopyToTable` class is throwing a `TypeError: object of type 'NoneType' has no len()` when the `self.columns` attribute is `None`. The issue arises from the attempt to check the length of `self.columns` directly without checking if it is `None` first.

## Bug Cause
The root cause of the bug is that the buggy code does not handle the case where `self.columns` is `None`. It directly tries to get the length of `self.columns` without verifying its existence or value, leading to a `TypeError`. The `self.columns` attribute can be `None` according to the usage mentioned in the class documentation.

## Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to first check if `self.columns` is not `None` before trying to access its length. If it is `None`, we can set `colnames` to an empty string directly. This will prevent the `TypeError` when `self.columns` is `None`.

## Corrected Function
```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options())
    )
```

In the corrected version, we added `if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:` to first check if `self.columns` is not `None` before trying to access its length. This change ensures that `colnames` is correctly set based on whether `self.columns` has elements or not. Additionally, we corrected the call to `self.copy_options` by adding parentheses to call the method correctly.

This corrected version should resolve the `TypeError` issue when `self.columns` is `None`.
