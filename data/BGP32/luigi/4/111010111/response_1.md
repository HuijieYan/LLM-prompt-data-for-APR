### Analysis:
1. The `copy` function within the `S3CopyToTable` class is failing due to a `TypeError: object of type 'NoneType' has no len()` error when `self.columns` is `None`.
2. The buggy function is trying to build the `colnames` string by joining the columns provided. Since `self.columns` is `None`, trying to get the length of it causes the error.
3. The issue is related to the GitHub issue mentioned, where providing `None` for columns to prohibit table creation causes the error. The suggested solution is to check if `self.columns` is truthy before proceeding with getting its length.
4. The strategy to fix the bug is to modify the conditional check for `self.columns` to ensure it is not `None` before trying to get its length.
   
### Correction:
```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
        """
        Defines copying from s3 into redshift.
    
        If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
        """
        logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
        colnames = ''
        if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:
            colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
            colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)
    
        cursor.execute("""
         COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
         CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
         {options}
         ;""".format(
            table=self.table,
            colnames=colnames,
            source=f,
            creds=self._credentials(),
            options=self.copy_options())
        )
```

By adding the condition `if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:` before building the `colnames` string, we ensure that `self.columns` is not `None` before proceeding, resolving the `TypeError` issue.
