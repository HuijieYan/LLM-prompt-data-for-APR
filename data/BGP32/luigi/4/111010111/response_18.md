## Analysis
The buggy function `copy` is trying to construct a query to copy data from S3 into Redshift. The issue arises when checking the length of `self.columns`, which is `None` in the failing test case. This results in a `TypeError` because `NoneType` does not have a `len()` method.

The underlying cause of the bug is that the function does not handle the case where `self.columns` is `None` before attempting to get its length.

## Solution
To fix the bug, we need to check if `self.columns` is not `None` before trying to get its length. If `self.columns` is not `None`, then we proceed to construct the column names. If it is `None`, we can initialize `colnames` as an empty string.

## Corrected Version

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    
    if self.columns is not None:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options())
    )
```

In the corrected version, we first check if `self.columns` is not `None` before proceeding to construct the column names. This change ensures that the function does not throw a `TypeError` when `self.columns` is `None`. The corrected function should now handle the case where `self.columns` is `None` appropriately.
