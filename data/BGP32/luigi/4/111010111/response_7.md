### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `copy` is part of the `S3CopyToTable` class in the `luigi/contrib/redshift.py` file.
2. The error occurs when trying to check the length of `self.columns`, which is set to `None`, leading to a `TypeError`.
3. The bug is caused by trying to get the length of `self.columns` without checking if it's `None` or not.
4. To fix the bug, we need to modify the condition checking the length of `self.columns` to avoid the `TypeError`.
5. The suggested fix is to change the condition to `if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:`.

### Bug Fix:
```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:  # Fix the condition to check if self.columns is not None
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

By making this change, the function will check if `self.columns` is not `None` before trying to get its length, avoiding the `TypeError`.
