### Analysis:
1. **Buggy Function Relationship:**
   - The buggy function `copy` is part of the `S3CopyToTable` class.
   - The class inherits from `rdbms.CopyToTable` and `_CredentialsMixin`.
   - The `copy` function uses `self.columns` to determine the length, which causes the bug.

2. **Error Locations:**
   - The error occurs at the line `if len(self.columns) > 0:` due to `self.columns` being `None`.
   - This leads to a `TypeError` when trying to get the length of a `NoneType` object.

3. **Cause of the Bug:**
   - **Bug Cause:** The bug arises from attempting to check the length of `self.columns` without handling the case where `self.columns` is `None`.
   - **Input Values:** During the failing test, `self.columns` is `None`.
   - **Expected Output:** The code should correctly handle the case of `self.columns` being `None`.
   - **GitHub Issue:** The issue describes the failure when `columns = None` and suggests checking `if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0`.

4. **Strategy for Fixing the Bug:**
   - The bug can be fixed by checking if `self.columns` is not `None` before attempting to get its length.
   - By modifying the condition to `if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:`, the bug should be resolved.

5. **Corrected Version:**
```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options())
    )
```
In the corrected version, the code now checks if `self.columns` is not `None` before proceeding to get its length to avoid the `TypeError` issue.
