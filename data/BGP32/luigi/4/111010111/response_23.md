## Analysis
1. The buggy function is `copy` within the `S3CopyToTable` class in `luigi/contrib/redshift.py`. The function is responsible for copying data from an S3 source to a Redshift table.
   
2. The error occurs due to dealing with `self.columns`, which is `None` in the failing test case.

3. The bug is caused by the if condition `if len(self.columns) > 0:` where `self.columns` is `None` in the failing test case. This causes a `TypeError` when trying to get the length of a `NoneType` object. The expected input values are `f` set to `'s3://bucket/key'`, `self.columns` set to `None`, and other relevant variables have specific values as well. The issue on GitHub describes this bug where passing `None` for `columns` leads to a failure.

4. To fix the bug, we need to check if `self.columns` is not `None` before trying to get its length. This prevents the `TypeError` from occurring.

5. Below is the corrected version of the `copy` function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

By adding the check `if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:` we ensure that the code executes only if `self.columns` is not `None`, thus preventing the `TypeError`.
