## Analysis
1. The buggy function `copy` in the `S3CopyToTable` class is failing due to `TypeError: object of type 'NoneType' has no len()` when trying to check the length of `self.columns`.
2. The `copy` function is attempting to construct a query to copy data from S3 to Redshift, but it fails to handle the case where `self.columns` is `None`.
3. The expected behavior is to allow `self.columns` to be `None` and handle it gracefully in the query construction.
4. The fix involves explicitly checking if `self.columns` is not `None` before checking its length to avoid the TypeError.

## Updated Code
```python
class S3CopyToTable(rdbms.CopyToTable, _CredentialsMixin):

    def copy_options(self):
        # Please ignore the body of this function

    def copy(self, cursor, f):
        """
        Defines copying from s3 into redshift.
    
        If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
        """
        logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
        colnames = ''
        
        if self.columns is not None and len(self.columns) > 0:
            colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
            colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

        cursor.execute("""
         COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
         CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
         {options}
         ;""".format(
            table=self.table,
            colnames=colnames,
            source=f,
            creds=self._credentials(),
            options=self.copy_options)
        )
```

By adding the check `if self.columns is not None` before checking its length, we ensure that the code handles the case where `self.columns` is `None` and avoids the `TypeError`.
