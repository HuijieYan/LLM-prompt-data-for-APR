### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `copy` in the `S3CopyToTable` class is attempting to check the length of `self.columns`, which is assumed to be a list, but since it is set to `None`, it results in a `TypeError`.
2. The error message indicates that the type `NoneType` has no length, causing the exception.
3. The expected behavior is to handle the case when `self.columns` is set to `None` without causing an error.
4. To fix the bug, we need to check if `self.columns` is not `None` before trying to access its length.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Check if `self.columns` is not `None` before checking its length.
2. If `self.columns` is `None`, handle it appropriately (by setting `colnames = ''` in this case).

### Corrected Version:
```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns is not None and len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

By adding the condition `if self.columns is not None and len(self.columns) > 0`, we ensure that accessing the length of `self.columns` is safe even when it's `None`. This modification should fix the bug and prevent the `TypeError` from occurring.
