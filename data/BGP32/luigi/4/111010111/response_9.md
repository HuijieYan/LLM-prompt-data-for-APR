## Identified issues:
1. The buggy function `copy` is trying to check the length of `self.columns` without checking if `self.columns` is not `None`, leading to a `TypeError` when `self.columns` is `None`.
2. The string formatting in the `cursor.execute` statement is using `self.copy_options` incorrectly.

## Bug cause:
The bug is caused by not checking if `self.columns` is not `None` before trying to get its length. When `self.columns` is `None`, the bug triggers a `TypeError`. Additionally, the incorrect usage of `self.copy_options` in the `cursor.execute` statement further compounds the issue.

## Suggested strategy to fix the bug:
To fix the bug, we need to:
1. Check if `self.columns` is not `None` before checking its length to prevent the `TypeError`.
2. Correctly call the `self.copy_options()` method to get the return value and include it in the `cursor.execute` statement.

## Corrected version of the function:
```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:  # Check if self.columns is not None
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options())
    )
```

In the corrected version, we first check if `self.columns` is not `None` before checking its length. We also correctly call `self.copy_options()` to get the return value and include it in the `cursor.execute` statement. This correction should resolve the `TypeError` caused by trying to get the length of a `NoneType` object and address the bug reported in the GitHub issue.
