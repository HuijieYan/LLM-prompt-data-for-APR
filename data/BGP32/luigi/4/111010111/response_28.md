## Analysis
1. The buggy function `copy` is part of the `S3CopyToTable` class in `luigi/contrib/redshift.py`.
2. The error occurs when trying to get the length of `self.columns`, which is set to `None` in the failing test case.
3. The error message indicates a `TypeError: object of type 'NoneType' has no len()`, which aligns with the fact that `self.columns` is `None`.
4. The error is due to the assumption that `self.columns` will always have a value, causing the function to fail when it is `None`.
5. The suggested strategy is to check if `self.columns` is not `None` before trying to get its length.

## Corrected Version
```python
class S3CopyToTable(rdbms.CopyToTable, _CredentialsMixin):
    """
    Template task for inserting a data set into Redshift from s3.
    
    Usage:
    
    * Subclass and override the required attributes:
    
      * `host`,
      * `database`,
      * `user`,
      * `password`,
      * `table`,
      * `columns`,
      * `s3_load_path`.
    
    * You can also override the attributes provided by the
      CredentialsMixin if they are not supplied by your
      configuration or environment variables.
    """

    def copy_options(self):
        # Please ignore the body of this function

    def copy(self, cursor, f):
        """
        Defines copying from s3 into redshift.
    
        If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
        """
        logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
        colnames = ''
        if self.columns is not None and len(self.columns) > 0:
            colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
            colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)
    
        cursor.execute("""
         COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
         CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
         {options}
         ;""".format(
            table=self.table,
            colnames=colnames,
            source=f,
            creds=self._credentials(),
            options=self.copy_options())
        )
```

By adding a check for `self.columns is not None` before trying to get its length, we prevent the `TypeError` that was occurring when `self.columns` was `None`. This corrected version should now pass the failing test case and handle the case where `columns` are not provided.
