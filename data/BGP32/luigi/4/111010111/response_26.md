## Analysis
1. The buggy function `copy` in the `S3CopyToTable` class is failing due to a `TypeError: object of type 'NoneType' has no len()`. The error occurs in the line `if len(self.columns) > 0` where `self.columns` is `None`.
2. The expected behavior is to handle the case when `self.columns` is `None` without causing a `TypeError`.
3. The related function `copy_options` seems irrelevant to the bug, and the error message clearly indicates that `self.columns` is `None`.
4. To fix the bug, we can modify the conditional check to `if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0` to handle the case when `self.columns` is `None`.
5. The corrected version of the function is provided below.

## Corrected Version
```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

By adding the check `if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0`, we ensure that the code does not attempt to calculate the length of `None`, avoiding the `TypeError`. This correction aligns with the suggested solution in the related GitHub issue.
