## Bug Analysis

### Buggy Function
The buggy function `copy` in the `S3CopyToTable` class in `luigi/contrib/redshift.py` is designed to copy data from an S3 source into a Redshift table. The issue arises when the `columns` attribute is set to `None`, causing a TypeError due to trying to retrieve the length of a `NoneType` object.

### Error Location
The error is occurring in the following line:
```python
if len(self.columns) > 0:
```

### Cause of the Bug
The bug is caused by assuming that `self.columns` will always be a list when attempting to get its length. When `columns` attribute is set to `None`, the comparison `len(self.columns) > 0` raises a TypeError since `NoneType` does not have a length.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug
To fix the bug, we need to include a check to ensure that `self.columns` is not `None` before attempting to get its length. By adding a condition `if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:`, we can avoid the TypeError when `columns` is set to `None`.

### Corrected Version of the Function

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

By adding the condition `if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:`, we ensure that the code only attempts to process the columns if `self.columns` is not `None`. This change should resolve the TypeError issue when `columns` is set to `None`.
