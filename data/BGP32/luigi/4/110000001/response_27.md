There are a few potential error locations within the `copy` function:

1. `logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)`: The `logger` object is used here without any prior definition or import statement. This could result in a `NameError`.

2. `colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)`: This line may raise an error if `colnames` is not defined before the if statement checking the length of `self.columns`.

3. `creds=self._credentials()`: The `_credentials` method is not defined within the `S3CopyToTable` class. This could result in a `NameError`.

To fix the buggy function, we can follow these steps:
1. Import the logger object if necessary.
2. Define `colnames` before the if statement to prevent any potential errors.
3. Define the `_credentials` method within the class or call it from a superclass if it is inherited.

Here is the corrected version of the `copy` function:

```python
# Import the necessary logger
import logging

# The declaration of the class containing the buggy function
class S3CopyToTable(rdbms.CopyToTable, _CredentialsMixin):
    """
    Template task for inserting a data set into Redshift from s3.
    
    Usage:
    
    * Subclass and override the required attributes:
    
      * `host`,
      * `database`,
      * `user`,
      * `password`,
      * `table`,
      * `columns`,
      * `s3_load_path`.
    
    * You can also override the attributes provided by the
      CredentialsMixin if they are not supplied by your
      configuration or environment variables.
    """

    # Corrected copy function
    def copy(self, cursor, f):
        """
        Defines copying from s3 into redshift.
    
        If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
        """
        logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)
        logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
        
        # Define colnames before the if statement
        colnames = ''
        if len(self.columns) > 0:
            colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
            colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)
    
        cursor.execute("""
         COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
         CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
         {options}
         ;""".format(
            table=self.table,
            colnames=colnames,
            source=f,
            creds=self._credentials(),
            options=self.copy_options)
        )
``` 

By following these steps and making the necessary corrections, the `copy` function should now work as intended without raising any errors.
