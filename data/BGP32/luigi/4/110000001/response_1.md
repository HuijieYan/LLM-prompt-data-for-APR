1. The buggy function `copy` within the `S3CopyToTable` class in the `luigi/contrib/redshift.py` file is responsible for copying data from S3 into Redshift. The function is supposed to execute a `COPY` command using the provided attributes. The potential error locations could be in the formatting of the SQL query or in the calling of `_credentials()` method.

2. The potential error locations are:
   - Formatting of the SQL query may lead to syntax errors.
   - The `_credentials()` method may not return the correct credentials.

3. The bug is caused by the improper formatting of the SQL query in the `cursor.execute` call. There might be issues with how the `COPY` command is being built with the provided attributes. Additionally, if the `_credentials()` method does not return the correct credentials, the `COPY` command will fail.

4. To fix the bug, we should ensure that the SQL query is properly formatted with the correct values for `{table}`, `{colnames}`, `{source}`, and `{creds}`. Additionally, make sure that the `_credentials()` method returns the expected credentials required for Redshift authentication.

5. Corrected version of the `copy` function:
```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
    COPY {} {}
    FROM '{}'
    CREDENTIALS '{}'
    {}
    ;""".format(
        self.table,
        colnames,
        f,
        self._credentials(),
        self.copy_options)
    )
```

In the corrected version, the SQL query string is formatted correctly with the placeholders replaced by the actual attribute values. The `if self.columns:` condition is used to check if columns are present before constructing `colnames`. Additionally, make sure `_credentials()` method returns the correct credentials needed for Redshift authentication.
