1. The buggy function `copy` within the `S3CopyToTable` class in the `luigi/contrib/redshift.py` file is responsible for copying data from S3 into Redshift. The function constructs and executes a SQL `COPY` command using attributes like `table`, `columns`, `copy_options`, and credentials obtained from the `_credentials` method.

2. The potential error location in the buggy function could be the construction of the SQL query string and the handling of placeholders like `{table}`, `{colnames}`, `{source}`, `{creds}`, and `{options}`.

3. The bug seems to stem from the use of placeholders without explicitly formatting them with the provided values. This can lead to SQL syntax errors and incorrect execution of the `COPY` command.

4. To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the placeholders in the SQL query string are correctly replaced with the actual values before executing the command. This can be done using string formatting methods like the `.format()` method in Python.

5. Here is the corrected version of the `copy` function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )

```

In this corrected version, we have properly formatted the SQL query string using the `.format()` method to replace the placeholders with their respective attribute values before executing the `COPY` command. This should resolve the bug and ensure the SQL query is correctly constructed and executed.
