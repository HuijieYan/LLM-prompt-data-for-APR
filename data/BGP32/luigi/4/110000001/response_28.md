Potential error locations within the buggy function:
1. The usage of logger without importing it and initializing it.
2. No error handling for the cursor.execute() method.
3. Incorrect usage of colnames variable.
4. Undefined attribute self.copy_options.

Explanation of the bug:
The bug in the provided function is that it uses the logger.info() method without importing and initializing the logger module. This will result in a NameError when trying to log information about inserting a file. Additionally, there is a potential issue with error handling as there is no try-except block around the cursor.execute() method. 

There is also an issue with how the colnames variable is being used. It is assumed to contain column names for the COPY command, but it may be incorrectly formatted. Lastly, the function references self.copy_options attribute, but it is not defined in the provided code snippet.

Strategy for fixing the bug:
1. Import and initialize the logger module.
2. Add error handling for the cursor.execute() method.
3. Format the colnames variable correctly to ensure the proper format for column names.
4. Define the self.copy_options attribute or handle its absence in a safe manner.

Corrected version of the function:
```python
import logging

class S3CopyToTable(rdbms.CopyToTable, _CredentialsMixin):
    """
    Template task for inserting a data set into Redshift from s3.

      * `columns`,
