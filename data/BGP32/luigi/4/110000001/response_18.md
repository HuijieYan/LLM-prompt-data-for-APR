### Analysis:
1. The `copy` function is part of the `S3CopyToTable` class in the `luigi.contrib.redshift.py` file.
2. The function is responsible for performing the copy operation from S3 into Redshift.
3. The bug seems to be related to the query formation within the `cursor.execute` method.
4. The bug might be caused by missing or incorrect placeholders in the query string that is passed to `cursor.execute`.

### Bug Explanation:
The bug in the `copy` function is related to the formation of the SQL query string passed to `cursor.execute`. The placeholders for `table`, `colnames`, `source`, `creds`, and `options` are not properly defined in the query string, leading to a syntax error or unexpected behavior.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the placeholders in the SQL query string are correctly defined and formatted. This includes replacing placeholders like `{table}`, `{colnames}`, `{source}`, `{creds}`, and `{options}` with the corresponding values from the class attributes.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)
    
    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
``` 

In the corrected version, we have ensured that the placeholders `{table}`, `{colnames}`, `{source}`, `{creds}`, and `{options}` are properly formatted and populated with the corresponding values from the class attributes before executing the SQL query.
