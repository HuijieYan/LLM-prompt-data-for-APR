The potential error in the buggy function `copy` lies in the formatting of the SQL query string. The `colnames` variable is being assigned as a string with column names separated by commas, but it is not being appropriately handled within the query string. Also, the `{options}` placeholder is being used without defining the `self.copy_options` attribute.

To fix the bug:
1. Update the `colnames` variable assignment to format it properly within the query string.
2. Define the `self.copy_options` attribute if it is necessary for the query.

Here is the corrected version of the `copy` function:

```python
    def copy(self, cursor, f):
        """
        Defines copying from s3 into redshift.
    
        If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
        """
        logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
        colnames = ''
        if self.columns:
            colnames = "(" + ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns]) + ")"
    
        cursor.execute("""
         COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
         CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
         {options}
         ;""".format(
            table=self.table,
            colnames=colnames,
            source=f,
            creds=self._credentials(),
            options=self.copy_options if hasattr(self, 'copy_options') else '')
        )
```

In this corrected version:
- The `colnames` variable is formatted with proper parentheses for the column names.
- The `self.copy_options` attribute is only included in the query if it is defined.
