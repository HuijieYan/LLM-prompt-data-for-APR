The bug in the provided function `copy` is related to the way the credentials are being inserted into the query. The function is trying to format the credentials directly into the query string, which can lead to syntax errors or security vulnerabilities.

To fix this bug, you should use parameterized queries instead of directly formatting the query string with credentials. This will ensure that the credentials are properly sanitized and prevent SQL injection attacks.

Here is a corrected version of the `copy` function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    query = """
    COPY {table} {colnames} from %s
    CREDENTIALS %s
    {options}
    ;""".format(table=self.table, colnames=colnames, options=self.copy_options)

    cursor.execute(query, (f, self._credentials()))
```

In this corrected version, we are using parameterized queries with placeholders `%s` for the `source` and `creds` values. When executing the query using `cursor.execute`, we pass these values as a tuple `(f, self._credentials())`. This approach ensures that the credentials are properly escaped and prevents any SQL injection vulnerabilities.

By making this change, the bug related to the direct formatting of credentials in the query string is fixed, and the function should work correctly without potential security risks.
