The potential error in the buggy function `copy()` lies in the formatting of the SQL query string within the `cursor.execute()` method. The placeholders `{table}`, `{colnames}`, `{source}`, `{creds}`, and `{options}` are used to insert values into the query, but the `colnames` variable may be empty if `self.columns` is empty. This could cause issues with the SQL syntax if an empty string is inserted for the column names in the query.

To fix this bug, we can check if `colnames` is empty before including it in the query string. If it's empty, we can omit it from the query. Here is the corrected version of the `copy()` function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    query = """
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)

    if not colnames:
        query = query.replace('{colnames} ', '')

    cursor.execute(query)
```

In this corrected version, we check if `colnames` is empty and remove it from the query string if it is. This ensures that the SQL query is constructed correctly even when there are no columns to include in the `COPY` statement.
