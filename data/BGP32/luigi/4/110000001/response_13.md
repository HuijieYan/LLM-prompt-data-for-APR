### Analysis:
The buggy function `copy` within the class `S3CopyToTable` is responsible for copying data from S3 into Redshift. The bug seems to be related to the formatting of the SQL query used to execute the `COPY` command. The bug might be due to the mismatch in the formatting of the `COPY` command query strings or incorrect concatenation of variables.

### Bug Identification:
The potential error locations within the buggy function are:
1. Formatting of the `COPY` command query strings.
2. Incorrect concatenation of variables like `source`, `creds`, etc.
3. Missing logger import statement.

### Cause of the Bug:
The bug most likely occurs due to the incorrect formatting and concatenation of variables in the `cursor.execute()` statement. This can lead to an error in the SQL query execution when trying to copy data from S3 to Redshift.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the SQL query passed to `cursor.execute()` is properly formatted with correct variable substitutions. Additionally, make sure to import the `logger` module if it is used for logging purposes.

### Corrected Version:
```python
import logging

# The relative path of the buggy file: luigi/contrib/redshift.py

# The declaration of the class containing the buggy function
class S3CopyToTable(rdbms.CopyToTable, _CredentialsMixin):
    """
    Template task for inserting a data set into Redshift from s3.
    
    Usage:
    
    * Subclass and override the required attributes:
    
      * `host`,
      * `database`,
      * `user`,
      * `password`,
      * `table`,
      * `columns`,
      * `s3_load_path`.
    
    * You can also override the attributes provided by the
      CredentialsMixin if they are not supplied by your
      configuration or environment variables.
    """

    def copy(self, cursor, f):
        """
        Defines copying from s3 into redshift.
    
        If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
        """
        logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)
        logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
        colnames = ''
        if len(self.columns) > 0:
            colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
            colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)
    
        cursor.execute("""
         COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
         CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
         {options}
         ;""".format(
            table=self.table,
            colnames=colnames,
            source=f,
            creds=self._credentials(),
            options=self.copy_options)
        )
```

In this corrected version, we have included the `logger` import statement to handle logging messages. We have also ensured proper formatting and concatenation of variables within the `cursor.execute()` SQL query string.
