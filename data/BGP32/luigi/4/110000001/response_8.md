Potential errors in the buggy function:
1. It is missing imports for modules like `logger`.
2. It uses `logger.info()` without defining `logger`.
3. The `_credentials()` method is called without being defined in the `S3CopyToTable` class.

Cause of the bug:
The bug in the function is due to missing imports and undefined methods, causing the function to not work as intended.

Strategy for fixing the bug:
1. Import the required modules.
2. Define the missing methods to ensure the function has all necessary components.

Corrected version of the function:

```python
import logging

# The declaration of the class containing the buggy function
class S3CopyToTable(rdbms.CopyToTable, _CredentialsMixin):
    """
    Template task for inserting a data set into Redshift from s3.
    
    Usage:
    
    * Subclass and override the required attributes:
    
      * `host`,
      * `database`,
      * `user`,
      * `password`,
      * `table`,
      * `columns`,
      * `s3_load_path`.
    
    * You can also override the attributes provided by the
      CredentialsMixin if they are not supplied by your
      configuration or environment variables.
    """

    def copy(self, cursor, f):
        """
        Defines copying from s3 into redshift.
    
        If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
        """
        logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)
        logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)

        if len(self.columns) > 0:
            colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
            colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)
    
        cursor.execute("""
