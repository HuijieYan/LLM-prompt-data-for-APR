### Analysis:
The buggy function `copy` in the `S3CopyToTable` class is responsible for copying data from S3 to Redshift. The function seems to have an issue with constructing the SQL query string for the `cursor.execute` method.

### Error Locations:
1. The string formatting in the cursor.execute method may have issues.
2. Improper handling of the `copy_options` attribute.

### Cause of the Bug:
The buggy function `copy` fails to properly construct the SQL query string for the `cursor.execute` method. It may have errors in the string formatting or could be missing some parameters. This results in a syntax error when trying to execute the SQL query.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to carefully construct the SQL query string for the `cursor.execute` method. Ensure that the formatting is correct and all required parameters are properly included. Additionally, address any issues related to the `copy_options` attribute.

### Corrected Version:
Here is the corrected version of the `copy` function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options if hasattr(self, 'copy_options') else '')
    )
```

In this corrected version, we have fixed the string formatting in the `cursor.execute` method and properly handled the `copy_options` attribute to avoid any syntax errors. This should resolve the bug in the `copy` function.
