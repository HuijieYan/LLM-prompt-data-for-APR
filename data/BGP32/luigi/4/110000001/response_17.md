The bug in the provided function `copy` lies in the way the `colnames` variable is generated. The code has a logical error where `colnames` is being constructed with column names but not considering the format of the column names in the query.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the `colnames` variable is correctly formatted with column names enclosed within parentheses when the list of columns is not empty.

Here is the corrected version of the function `copy`:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

In this corrected version, we ensure that the `colnames` variable is correctly constructed with column names enclosed within parentheses when the list of columns is not empty. This should address the bug and ensure that the function operates as intended.
