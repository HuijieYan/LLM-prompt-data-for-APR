The bug in the provided function `copy` is a missing import statement for the logger object and an undefined `options` attribute. 

Here are the steps to fix the bug:

1. Add the import statement for the logger object at the beginning of the file:
```python
import logging
logger = logging.getLogger('luigi-interface')
```

2. Define the `copy_options` attribute in the class `S3CopyToTable`:
```python
copy_options = "" # Add this line above the copy method
```

3. Modify the copy method to include these changes:
```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

By making these changes, the function will be able to successfully log the file being inserted and execute the copy command with the specified options.
