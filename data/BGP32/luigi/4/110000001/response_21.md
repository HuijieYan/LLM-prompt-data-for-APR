The potential error in the buggy function is with the formatting of the SQL query string in the `cursor.execute` method. The placeholders like `{table}`, `{colnames}`, `{source}`, `{creds}`, and `{options}` should be properly replaced with their corresponding values before executing the query.

One strategy to fix this bug is to ensure that the placeholders in the SQL query string are properly formatted with the correct values using the `.format()` method. Also, considering any potential issues with the values being inserted into the query, such as SQL injection vulnerabilities or incorrect data types, should be addressed.

Here is the corrected version of the `copy` function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} FROM '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

In this corrected version, the placeholders in the query string have been properly formatted and replaced with their corresponding values. Additionally, the `if len(self.columns) > 0` condition has been simplified to `if self.columns` for readability.
