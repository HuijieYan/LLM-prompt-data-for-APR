## Analysis:
1. The buggy function `copy` is responsible for copying data from s3 into Redshift.
2. The potential error location is in the `cursor.execute` statement where the `colnames` variable is being formatted into the SQL query.
3. The bug is likely caused by the way `colnames` is being used in the formatted SQL query. If `self.columns` is not provided or is empty, `colnames` will be an empty string and the syntax of the SQL query may be incorrect.
4. To fix the bug, we need to handle the case where `self.columns` is empty or not provided, and ensure that the SQL query syntax is correct in all cases.

## Bug Fix:
```python
# The corrected version of the buggy function
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)
    
    if colnames:
        colnames = ' ' + colnames  # Add a space before colnames if it is not empty
    
    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table}{colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

In the corrected version, we added an additional check for `colnames` being empty before including it in the SQL query. This ensures that the query syntax is correct even when `self.columns` is empty.
