The buggy function `copy` in the `S3CopyToTable` class of the `luigi/contrib/redshift.py` file has a bug where the `logger` object is used without being imported or defined in the class. This will result in an error when trying to execute `logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)`.

To fix this bug:
1. Add the `logger` object import at the top of the file:

```python
import logging
logger = logging.getLogger('luigi-interface')
```

2. Ensure that the bug is fixed by adding the missing `logger` import and that any other dependencies required by the function are included in the class.

Here is the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
import logging

class S3CopyToTable(rdbms.CopyToTable, _CredentialsMixin):
    """
    Template task for inserting a data set into Redshift from s3.
    
    Usage:
    
    * Subclass and override the required attributes:
    
      * `host`,
      * `database`,
      * `user`,
      * `password`,
      * `table`,
      * `columns`,
      * `s3_load_path`.
    
    * You can also override the attributes provided by the
      CredentialsMixin if they are not supplied by your
      configuration or environment variables.
    """
    
    def copy(self, cursor, f):
        """
        Defines copying from s3 into redshift.
    
        If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
        """
        logger = logging.getLogger('luigi-interface')
        logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
        colnames = ''
        if len(self.columns) > 0:
            colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
            colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)
    
        cursor.execute("""
         COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
         CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
         {options}
         ;""".format(
            table=self.table,
            colnames=colnames,
            source=f,
            creds=self._credentials(),
            options=self.copy_options)
        )
```
