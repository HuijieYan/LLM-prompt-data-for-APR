The bug in the `copy` function lies in the way the `COPY` command is executed. The issue is that the `creds` placeholder in the `COPY` command is not using the correct format to specify credentials for Redshift. 

To fix the bug, we need to update the `copy` function to properly format the `CREDENTIALS` parameter in the `COPY` command.

Here is the corrected version of the `copy` function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     IAM_ROLE '{iam_role}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        iam_role=self.iam_role,
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

In this corrected version, we replaced the `CREDENTIALS` placeholder with `IAM_ROLE` and added a corresponding placeholder `{iam_role}` in the `format` method. This change ensures that the correct credentials are used for the `COPY` command when copying data from S3 into Redshift.
