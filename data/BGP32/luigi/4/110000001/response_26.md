The bug in the provided `copy` function is the way the `cursor.execute` method is being called. The f-string is passing the query in a multi-line format with no regard for any newlines or indentation. This can cause issues with executing the query properly.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the way the query is constructed and passed to the `cursor.execute` method. We can concatenate the query string in a single line format before passing it to the `execute` method.

Here is the corrected version of the `copy` function:

```python
# this is the corrected copy function
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    query = """
        COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
        CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
        {options}
        ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options
    )

    cursor.execute(query)
```

By concatenating the query string in a single line format and then passing it to the `cursor.execute` method, we ensure that there are no issues with newlines or indentation affecting the execution of the query.
