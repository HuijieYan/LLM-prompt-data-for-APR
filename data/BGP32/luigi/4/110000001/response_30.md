The bug in the `copy` function of the `S3CopyToTable` class lies in the way the SQL query is constructed. Specifically, the source path (`source=f`) is inserted directly into the query string without proper formatting. This can lead to SQL injection vulnerabilities and errors if the source path contains special characters.

To fix the bug, we should use parameterized queries to safely insert variables into the SQL query. This helps prevent SQL injection attacks and ensures the query is executed correctly.

Here is the corrected version of the `copy` function with parameterized queries:

```python
    def copy(self, cursor, f):
        """
        Defines copying from s3 into redshift.
    
        If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
        """
        logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
        colnames = ''
        if len(self.columns) > 0:
            colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
            colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)
    
        cursor.execute("""
         COPY {table} {colnames} from %s
         CREDENTIALS %s
         %s
         ; """.format(
            table=self.table,
            colnames=colnames
        ), (f, self._credentials(), self.copy_options))
```

In the corrected version, the source path `f` and the credentials are passed as parameters to the `cursor.execute()` method, ensuring they are safely inserted into the SQL query. This prevents any potential SQL injection vulnerabilities or errors.
