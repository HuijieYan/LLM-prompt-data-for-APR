The buggy function 'copy' in the S3CopyToTable class is failing because it is not properly handling the case when the 'columns' attribute is None. This causes an issue when constructing the 'colnames' string, resulting in an empty string instead of skipping the colnames section entirely.

To fix the bug, we need to check if 'self.columns' is not None before constructing the 'colnames' string. If 'self.columns' is None, we should skip the colnames section in the COPY command.

Here is the corrected version of the 'copy' function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns is not None and len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

By adding a check for 'self.columns is not None' before constructing 'colnames', the function will now handle the case when 'columns' are None and construct the COPY command correctly. This corrected version should pass the failing test provided.
