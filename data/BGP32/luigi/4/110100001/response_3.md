The bug in the `copy` function is caused by the `colnames` variable being set to an empty string when the `columns` attribute is `None`. This results in an empty string being passed to the `COPY` statement rather than skipping the column names section. To fix this bug, we need to check if `self.columns` is `None` before constructing the `colnames` variable.

Here is the corrected version of the `copy` function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns is not None and len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

By adding the check `if self.columns is not None and len(self.columns) > 0`, we ensure that the `colnames` variable is only constructed if `self.columns` is not `None` and contains elements. This change will fix the bug in the `copy` function and allow it to correctly handle cases where the `columns` attribute is `None`.

The corrected version of the `copy` function should now pass the failing test provided.
