### Analysis:
- The buggy function is `copy` within the `S3CopyToTable` class from `luigi/contrib/redshift.py`.
- The `copy` function is responsible for copying data from S3 into Redshift using the provided credentials and options.
- The potential error location is the construction of the `colnames` variable and its usage in the `cursor.execute` statement.
- The failing test `test_s3_copy_with_nonetype_columns` is checking if the `copy` function correctly constructs and executes the `COPY` statement with empty `colnames`.

### Bug Cause:
- The bug in the `copy` function arises from the incorrect handling of empty `columns`.
- When `self.columns` is `None` or empty, the code attempts to construct `colnames` by joining the columns, resulting in an empty string.
- However, in the `cursor.execute` statement, the `colnames` should be left empty when there are no columns provided, instead of being an empty string.
- This discrepancy causes the test to fail as it expects an empty `colnames` when `columns=None`.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
- Check if `self.columns` is `None` or empty, and handle this case separately to assign an empty value to `colnames`.
- Update the `cursor.execute` statement to correctly handle the case where no column names are provided.
- This fix will align the behavior of the `copy` function with the expectations of the failing test.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from S3 into Redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames if colnames else '',
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

### Explanation of Correction:
- In the corrected version, the `if self.columns:` condition is used to check if columns are provided.
- If `columns` has values, `colnames` is constructed as before. If `columns` is `None` or empty, `colnames` is set to an empty string directly in the `cursor.execute` statement.
- This modification ensures that the `colnames` correctly reflects the absence of columns when needed, fixing the bug identified in the original code.
