The bug in the `copy` function of the `S3CopyToTable` class is related to the formatting of the `COPY` SQL statement. The issue arises because when `self.columns` is `None`, the `colnames` variable is set to an empty string, but the `COPY` statement includes the column names even when they are not provided.

To fix this bug, we can modify the `copy` function to only include the column names in the `COPY` statement if `self.columns` is not `None`. If `self.columns` is `None`, we should skip adding the column names to the statement.

Here is the corrected version of the `copy` function:

```python
# The corrected version of the buggy function
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

By checking if `self.columns` is not `None` before including the column names in the `COPY` statement, we ensure that the statement is correctly formatted based on the presence of column names.

This corrected version should now pass the failing test provided.
