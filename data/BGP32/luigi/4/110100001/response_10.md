### Analysis:
The buggy function `copy` in the `S3CopyToTable` class is failing because it is not correctly formatting the `colnames` variable when generating the SQL query string for the `COPY` operation. In the test function `test_s3_copy_with_nonetype_columns`, the `columns` attribute has been set to `None`, which leads to an empty `colnames` string in the SQL query. However, the buggy function does not handle this case properly, resulting in missing parentheses in the generated query.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is caused by the buggy `copy` function not handling the case where the `columns` attribute can be `None`. When `columns` is `None`, the function does not set the `colnames` string to an empty string with parentheses, leading to incorrect SQL formatting.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to check if the `columns` attribute is `None` and handle that case by setting `colnames` to an empty string with parentheses when needed. This can be achieved by adding a condition to check for `None` and properly formatting the `colnames` variable in the SQL query string.

### Corrected Version:
Here is the corrected version of the `copy` function in the `S3CopyToTable` class:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns is not None and len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)
    else:
        colnames = '()'

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

By including the 'if' condition to check for `None` in `self.columns`, we ensure that the `colnames` variable is correctly handled in the SQL query string generation, even if `columns` is `None`. This will address the bug and allow the corrected version to pass the failing test.
