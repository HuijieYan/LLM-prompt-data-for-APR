The bug in the provided function `copy` is related to the formatting of the SQL query string. The issue lies with the incorrect indentation causing the `cursor.execute` call to fail as it expects a valid SQL query string.

To fix this bug, we need to adjust the indentation of the SQL query string within the `cursor.execute` call in the `copy` function.

Here is the corrected version of the `copy` function:

```python
# The corrected version of the buggy function
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options
     )
    )

```

By correcting the indentation of the `cursor.execute` call, the SQL query string will now be properly formatted and can be executed successfully.

This corrected version should now pass the failing test that checks the proper execution of the `COPY` statement.
