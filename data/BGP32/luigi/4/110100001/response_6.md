## Analysis:
1. The `copy` function in the `S3CopyToTable` class is responsible for executing a `COPY` command to load data from S3 into Redshift.
2. The bug is related to how the `colnames` variable is being handled. If the `columns` attribute is `None`, the `colnames` should be an empty string. The bug occurs when trying to join the columns with a comma when `self.columns` is `None`, causing a `TypeError`.
3. The failing test `test_s3_copy_with_nonetype_columns` is mocking the call to the `copy` function with `columns=None`. Since the `columns` attribute is `None`, it should result in an empty `colnames` value.
4. To fix the bug, we need to ensure that if `self.columns` is `None`, `colnames` is set to an empty string before using it in the `COPY` SQL query.
5. Here's the corrected version of the `copy` function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.
    
    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)
    
    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

By checking if `self.columns` is not `None` before attempting to join its values, we prevent the `TypeError` that occurred when `self.columns` is `None`. This correction ensures that the `colnames` variable is correctly handled in the `COPY` SQL query.
