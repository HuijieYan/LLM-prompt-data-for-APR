The bug in the provided code lies in the `colnames` variable assignment within the `copy` method of the `S3CopyToTable` class. The bug is causing the `colnames` not to be included in the `COPY` statement when it should be. This leads to a mismatch in the expected SQL query in the test case `test_s3_copy_with_nonetype_columns`.

To fix this bug, we need to check if the `self.columns` attribute is not `None` before constructing the `colnames` string. If `self.columns` is not `None`, then construct the `colnames` string, else keep it empty.

Here is the corrected version of the `copy` method:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.
    
    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns is not None and len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)
    
    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

This corrected version checks if `self.columns` is not `None` before constructing the `colnames` string. If `self.columns` is not `None`, it constructs the `colnames` string with the column names; otherwise, it keeps it empty. This way, the corrected version ensures that the `colnames` are correctly included in the `COPY` statement when needed.
