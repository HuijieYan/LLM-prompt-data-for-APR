The bug in the `copy` function of the `S3CopyToTable` class is due to the way it handles the case when `self.columns` is `None`. In the provided buggy code, if `self.columns` is `None`, the function tries to access `len(None)`, which causes a `TypeError` as you cannot find the length of `None`.

To fix this bug, we need to add a check for `None` before attempting to access the length of `self.columns`. If `self.columns` is not `None`, then we proceed with processing the columns, otherwise, we handle the case where no column information is provided.

Here is the corrected version of the `copy` function:

```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: luigi/contrib/redshift.py

# The corrected version of the copy function
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

With this correction, the `copy` function will now properly handle the case when `self.columns` is `None` without causing a `TypeError`. It will create an empty `colnames` string when no columns are provided.

Now, when running the failing test for the `S3CopyToTable` class, it should pass without any issues related to the handling of `None` columns.
