### Analysis
The `copy` function within the `S3CopyToTable` class is responsible for copying data from S3 to Redshift, but it seems to have a couple of potential issues:
1. The `colnames` variable is constructed by joining the column names in the task's `columns` attribute. If `columns` is `None`, this could cause an issue when formatting the SQL statement.
2. The format string used for the SQL `COPY` command may not handle cases where certain values (like `colnames`) are empty.


### Bug Explanation
The bug arises from the fact that the `colnames` variable is not properly handled when the `columns` attribute of the task is None. This causes issues when constructing the SQL `COPY` command since an empty string is not being handled correctly in the format string.


### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to check if the `columns` attribute is None and handle it properly both when constructing the `colnames` string and when formatting the SQL `COPY` command. We should ensure that if `columns` is None, the `colnames` part of the SQL command is omitted.


### Corrected Version
After considering the analysis and bug fix strategy, here is the corrected version of the `copy` function within the `S3CopyToTable` class:

```python
    def copy(self, cursor, f):
        """
        Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

        If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
        """
        logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
        colnames = ''
        
        # Check if columns is not None before constructing colnames
        if self.columns:
            colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
            colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)
    
        cursor.execute("""
         COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
         CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
         {options}
         ;""".format(
            table=self.table,
            colnames=colnames,
            source=f,
            creds=self._credentials(),
            options=self.copy_options)
        )
```

By checking if `self.columns` is not None before constructing `colnames`, we ensure that the SQL `COPY` command is formatted correctly even when `columns` is None. This fix should address the issue and make the `copy` function more robust.
