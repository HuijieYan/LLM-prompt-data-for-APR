The bug in the `copy` function of the `S3CopyToTable` class is that it does not handle the case when `self.columns` is `None`. This results in an error when trying to iterate over `self.columns` to extract the column names for the `COPY` statement.

To fix this bug, we can add a check to see if `self.columns` is `None` before trying to extract the column names.

Here is the corrected version of the `copy` function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns is not None and len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

With this change, the `copy` function will now handle the case when `self.columns` is `None` and set `colnames` to an empty string in that scenario. This will prevent any errors related to trying to access attributes of `None`.
