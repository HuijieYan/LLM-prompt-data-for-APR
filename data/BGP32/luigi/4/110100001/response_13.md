The bug in the `copy` function is related to how the `colnames` variable is handled. If `self.columns` is empty (or `None`), the `colnames` variable should be an empty string `''`, but in the current implementation, it is not handled correctly.

The code snippet `if len(self.columns) > 0:` checks if `self.columns` has elements. However, when `self.columns` is `None`, this check will throw an error. To fix this bug, we need to check if `self.columns` is not `None` before trying to access its length.

Here's the corrected version:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

This corrected version ensures that `colnames` is assigned an empty string `''` when `self.columns` is `None`, fixing the bug identified in the `copy` function.
