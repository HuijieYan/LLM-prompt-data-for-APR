The bug in the `copy` function of the `S3CopyToTable` class in `redshift.py` is due to the incorrect handling of the `colnames` variable when it is empty. The function is trying to format the SQL query with the column names, even when there are none provided.

To fix this bug, we need to adjust the logic to only include the `colnames` in the form of `({colnames})` if there are columns present. Otherwise, it should be an empty string.

Here is the corrected version of the `copy` function:

```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: luigi/contrib/redshift.py

# The declaration of the class containing the buggy function
class S3CopyToTable(rdbms.CopyToTable, _CredentialsMixin):
    """
    Template task for inserting a data set into Redshift from s3.
    
    Usage:
    
    * Subclass and override the required attributes:
    
      * `host`,
      * `database`,
      * `user`,
      * `password`,
      * `table`,
      * `columns`,
      * `s3_load_path`.
    
    * You can also override the attributes provided by the
      CredentialsMixin if they are not supplied by your
      configuration or environment variables.
    """




    # this is the corrected function
    def copy(self, cursor, f):
        """
        Defines copying from s3 into redshift.
    
        If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
        """
        logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
        colnames = ''
        if self.columns:
            colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
            colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)
    
        cursor.execute("""
         COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
         CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
         {options}
         ;""".format(
            table=self.table,
            colnames=colnames,
            source=f,
            creds=self._credentials(),
            options=self.copy_options)
        )
```

By checking if `self.columns` is not empty before constructing the `colnames`, we ensure that the `colnames` variable is correctly formatted based on the presence of columns. This correction should resolve the bug in the `copy` function.
