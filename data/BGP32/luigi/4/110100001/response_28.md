The bug in the provided function `copy(self, cursor, f)` is related to the `colnames` variable. If `self.columns` is `None`, the code will throw an exception since it tries to access the `len` attribute of `None`.

To fix this, we need to add a check for `None` before trying to create the `colnames` string. If `self.columns` is not `None`, then we can proceed to build the `colnames` string.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into Redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

This corrected version of the function includes a check for `self.columns` before accessing its length. This ensures that the `colnames` variable is only created when `self.columns` is not `None`.

By making this change, the function should now work correctly and pass the failing test provided.
