The bug in the `copy` function of the `S3CopyToTable` class is the way it handles the `colnames` variable. When the `columns` attribute is `None` or empty, the `colnames` variable is set to an empty string and then inserted into the `COPY` statement without checking for its length. This results in an incorrect SQL query being executed.

To fix this bug, we need to check if the `columns` attribute is not `None` or empty before constructing the `colnames` string. If it is `None` or empty, we should exclude the column names from the `COPY` statement.

Here is the corrected version of the `copy` function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

This version of the `copy` function ensures that the `colnames` are only included in the `COPY` statement if the `columns` attribute is not `None` or empty. This will prevent the SQL query from failing when `columns` are not provided.

Once you replace the buggy function with this corrected version, the failing test `test_s3_copy_with_nonetype_columns` should pass without any issues.
