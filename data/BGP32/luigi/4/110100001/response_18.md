The cause of the bug in the `copy` function is related to the condition checking the length of `self.columns`. If `self.columns` is `None` or an empty list, the condition `if len(self.columns) > 0` will fail since it expects `self.columns` to be a list. This leads to the `colnames` variable not being correctly set to an empty string when `self.columns` is `None`.

To fix this bug, we can modify the condition to explicitly check if `self.columns` is not `None` before trying to access its length.

Here is the corrected version of the `copy` function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns is not None:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

With this correction, the `copy` function should work correctly and pass the failing test.
