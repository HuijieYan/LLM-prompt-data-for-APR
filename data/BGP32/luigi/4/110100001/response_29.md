## Analysis:
1. The `copy` function within the `S3CopyToTable` class is responsible for executing a `COPY` command in Redshift from an S3 source.
2. The bug appears to be related to the `colnames` variable not being properly handled when the `columns` attribute is `None`.
3. The failing test `test_s3_copy_with_nonetype_columns` is mocking a scenario where the `columns` attribute is `None`, thus exposing the bug in the `copy` function.
4. To fix the bug, we need to handle the case where `self.columns` is `None` and set `colnames` appropriately to avoid errors.

## Fix:
```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    
    if self.columns is None:
        colnames = ''
    else:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

By checking if `self.columns` is `None` and setting `colnames` accordingly, we can fix the bug in the `copy` function. This updated version should pass the failing test `test_s3_copy_with_nonetype_columns`.
