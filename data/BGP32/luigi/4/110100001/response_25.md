### Analysis:
1. The `copy` function in the `S3CopyToTable` class is responsible for executing a `COPY` command to load data from S3 into Redshift.
2. The buggy function seems to be missing the handling of the `options` attribute, which is required for the `COPY` command to work correctly.
3. The failing test `test_s3_copy_with_nonetype_columns` is checking if the `COPY` command is executed with proper formatting and parameters. It expects the `options` to be included in the `COPY` command.
4. To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the `options` attribute is correctly included in the `COPY` command in the `copy` function.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Update the `copy` function in the `S3CopyToTable` class to include the `options` attribute in the `COPY` command template.
2. Ensure that the `options` attribute is properly handled and formatted when constructing the `COPY` command.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options if self.copy_options else '')
    )
```

I have added `self.copy_options if self.copy_options else ''` to include the `options` attribute in the `COPY` command template based on whether `copy_options` is provided in the class instance. This modification should address the bug and ensure that the `options` are correctly included in the `COPY` command.
