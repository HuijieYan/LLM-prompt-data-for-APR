The issue with the buggy function `copy` in the `S3CopyToTable` class appears to be related to the way the `colnames` variable is constructed and used in the SQL query passed to the `cursor.execute` method.

The buggy function is assuming that if `self.columns` is `None`, then `colnames` will be an empty string `''`. However, since `self.columns` is not `None`, but an empty list `[]`, the logic to construct `colnames` needs to be adjusted.

To fix the bug, you can modify the logic in the `copy` function to handle the case when `self.columns` is an empty list correctly. Here is the corrected version of the `copy` function:

```python
    def copy(self, cursor, f):
        """
        Defines copying from s3 into redshift.
    
        If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
        """
        logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
        colnames = ''
        if self.columns:
            colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
            colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)
    
        cursor.execute("""
         COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
         CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
         {options}
         ;""".format(
            table=self.table,
            colnames=colnames,
            source=f,
            creds=self._credentials(),
            options=self.copy_options)
        )
```

This corrected version of the `copy` function should now properly handle the case when `self.columns` is an empty list, ensuring that the SQL query is constructed correctly based on the presence of column names.

By making this adjustment, the provided failing test `test_s3_copy_with_nonetype_columns` should now pass without any issues.
