The bug in the `copy` function is caused by the `colnames` variable being an empty string when no columns are defined. This results in the `colnames` part of the `COPY` statement being generated incorrectly.

To fix the bug, we need to check if any columns are defined before building the `colnames` variable. If no columns are defined, we should not include the `colnames` part in the `COPY` statement.

Here is the corrected version of the `copy` function:

```python
    def copy(self, cursor, f):
        """
        Defines copying from s3 into redshift.
    
        If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
        """
        logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
        colnames = ''
        if self.columns:
            colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
            colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)
    
        copy_query = """
         COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
         CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
         {options}
         ;""".format(
            table=self.table,
            colnames=colnames,
            source=f,
            creds=self._credentials(),
            options=self.copy_options
        )
        
        cursor.execute(copy_query)
```

This corrected version of the function checks if columns are defined before including them in the `COPY` statement.

With this fix, the `test_s3_copy_with_nonetype_columns` test should pass successfully.
