The bug in the `copy` function lies in the way it handles `colnames`. The function constructs the `colnames` string by joining the column names with commas, but it fails to account for the case when `self.columns` is `None`, which leads to an empty string being assigned to `colnames`.

To fix this bug, we need to add a check to handle the case when `self.columns` is `None`. We can modify the function to check if `self.columns` is `None` before constructing the `colnames` string. If `self.columns` is not `None`, then we proceed with constructing the string as before.

Here is the corrected version of the `copy` function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns is not None:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

With this modification, the `copy` function will check if `self.columns` is `None` before constructing the `colnames` string, avoiding the bug that caused the failing test.
