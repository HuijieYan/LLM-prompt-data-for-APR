### Analysis:
The buggy function `copy` within the `S3CopyToTable` class is failing to properly handle the case when `columns` attribute is `None`. This results in an empty `colnames` being passed to the `COPY` command, causing the indentation of the SQL query to be incorrect.

### Identifying Potential Error:
1. The `if len(self.columns) > 0` condition is problematic if `columns` is `None`.
2. The `colnames` variable is not properly handled if `columns` is `None`.

### Explanation of the Bug:
The bug occurs because the condition `if len(self.columns) > 0` assumes that `self.columns` is always a list, but when it is `None`, it fails. This leads to an empty `colnames` variable and incorrect formatting of the `COPY` query.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
1. Check if `self.columns` is not `None` before processing its length.
2. Handle the case when `columns` is `None` separately to avoid the issue.
3. Update the `COPY` query construction logic to handle the `colnames` properly.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns is not None:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

Now, the corrected version of the `copy` function should properly handle the case when `columns` is `None`, ensuring the correct formatting of the `COPY` query. This corrected version should pass the failing test provided.
