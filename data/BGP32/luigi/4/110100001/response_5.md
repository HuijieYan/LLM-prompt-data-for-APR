The bug in the `copy` function is caused by the way the `colnames` are handled when there are no columns specified. The `colnames` variable is being set to an empty string, but when formatting the SQL query, the `colnames` are enclosed in parentheses which should not happen when there are no columns.

To fix the bug, we need to check if there are columns specified before building the `colnames` string and if there are no columns, we should not include the parentheses in the final query.

Here is the corrected version of the `copy` function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    
    if self.columns:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)
    
    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

This correction ensures that the `(col1,col2,col3)` format is only used when there are columns specified, and it will not include the parentheses when there are no columns specified.
