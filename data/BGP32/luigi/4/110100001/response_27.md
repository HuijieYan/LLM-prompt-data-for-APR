The bug in the `copy` function is related to handling of the `colnames` variable. In the current implementation, if the `columns` attribute is set as `None`, the `colnames` variable is an empty string, resulting in an extra comma in the SQL query.

To fix this bug, we need to check if the `columns` attribute is `None` before constructing the `colnames` variable. If `columns` is not `None`, then we construct the comma-separated column names.

Here is the corrected version of the `copy` function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns is not None:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

With this correction, the `colnames` variable will only contain column names if the `columns` attribute is not `None`, which will remove the extra comma from the SQL query.
