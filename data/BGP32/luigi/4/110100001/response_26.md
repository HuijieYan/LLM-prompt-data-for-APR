The bug in the `copy` function of the `S3CopyToTable` class is due to the incorrect handling of the `colnames` variable. When `self.columns` is `None` or empty, the `colnames` variable should remain an empty string. However, the current code does not handle this case properly, which results in a `None` value assigned to `colnames`.

To fix this bug, you can update the code to check if `self.columns` is not `None` before constructing the `colnames` variable. If `self.columns` is not `None`, then construct the comma-separated column names as before. Otherwise, let `colnames` remain an empty string.

Here is the corrected version of the `copy` function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

After updating the `copy` function with the corrected logic for handling `colnames`, it should pass the failing test `test_s3_copy_with_nonetype_columns`.
