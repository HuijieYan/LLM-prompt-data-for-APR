The bug in the `copy` function within the `S3CopyToTable` class is the way it handles `colnames` when the `columns` attribute is set to `None`. When `columns` is `None`, the code should not attempt to build the `colnames` string.

To fix this bug, we need to update the `copy` function to properly handle the case when `self.columns` is `None` by checking for its existence before trying to generate the `colnames` string.

Here is the corrected version of the `copy` function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns is not None and len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

With this correction, the `colnames` string will only be generated if `self.columns` is not `None`, ensuring that the `copy` function works correctly even when `columns` is not provided.

This corrected version of the `copy` function should now pass the failing test `test_s3_copy_with_nonetype_columns`.
