The bug in the `copy` function is related to the `colnames` variable. In the code, `colnames` is being set to an empty string (`''`) at the beginning, and then it is being updated based on the columns provided in `self.columns`. However, in the test case `test_s3_copy_with_nonetype_columns`, the `columns` attribute is set to `None`.

Since `self.columns` is `None`, the length check `len(self.columns) > 0` will raise an exception when trying to access the length of `None`.

To fix the issue, we can add a condition to check if `self.columns` is not `None` before trying to access the length and build the `colnames` string.

Here's the corrected version of the `copy` function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

With this correction, the function will handle the case where `self.columns` is `None` and avoid the exception when trying to access its length.
