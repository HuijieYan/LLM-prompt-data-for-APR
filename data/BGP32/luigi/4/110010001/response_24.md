### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `copy` in the `S3CopyToTable` class is supposed to copy data from an S3 source into a Redshift table.
2. The error message states `TypeError: object of type 'NoneType' has no len()`, indicating that the `self.columns` attribute is `None`.
3. The cause of the bug is that the `copy` function is not handling the case where `self.columns` is `None`, which results in trying to get the length of a `NoneType` object.
4. To fix the bug, we need to check if `self.columns` is `None` and handle it appropriately.
5. We will modify the `copy` function to check if `self.columns` is not `None` before proceeding to get the column names.

### Corrected Version:
```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: luigi/contrib/redshift.py

class S3CopyToTable(rdbms.CopyToTable, _CredentialsMixin):

    def copy(self, cursor, f):
        """
        Defines copying from s3 into redshift.
    
        If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
        """
        logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
        colnames = ''
        if self.columns is not None:
            colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
            colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)
    
        cursor.execute("""
         COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
         CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
         {options}
         ;""".format(
            table=self.table,
            colnames=colnames,
            source=f,
            creds=self._credentials(),
            options=self.copy_options)
        )
``` 

By incorporating the `if self.columns is not None:` check before accessing the `self.columns`, we ensure that the code will not throw a `TypeError` when `self.columns` is `None`. This fix handles the scenario where `self.columns` is `None` gracefully.
