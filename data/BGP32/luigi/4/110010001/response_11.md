### Analysis:
The error occurs in the `copy` function of the `S3CopyToTable` class in `luigi/contrib/redshift.py` file. The error message indicates a `TypeError` where an object of type `NoneType` (specifically `self.columns`) is being used in a comparison operation (`if len(self.columns) > 0`).

### Potential Error Location:
The potential error location is within the `if len(self.columns) > 0:` check in the `copy` function.

### Cause of the Bug:
The bug is caused by passing `None` as the value for the `columns` attribute in the `DummyS3CopyToTableKey` instance. When `columns` is `None`, trying to execute `len(self.columns)` on a `NoneType` results in the `TypeError`.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
It's necessary to check if `self.columns` is not `None` before proceeding with the `len` function call.

### Corrected Version:
Here is the corrected version of the `copy` function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

By adding the `if self.columns` check before the `len(self.columns)` condition, we ensure that the operation is only performed if `self.columns` is not `None`. This modification avoids the `TypeError` raised when `self.columns` is `None`.
