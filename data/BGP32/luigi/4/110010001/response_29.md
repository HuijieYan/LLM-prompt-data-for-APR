### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `copy` in the `S3CopyToTable` class within the `luigi/contrib/redshift.py` file is causing a `TypeError` when trying to get the length of `self.columns`, which is `None`.
2. The error message indicates that the `TypeError` occurs in the line `if len(self.columns) > 0:` due to trying to get the length of a `NoneType` object.
3. The bug occurs because the `columns` attribute is being set to `None`, and the code does not handle this scenario gracefully.
4. To fix this bug, we need to check if `self.columns` is not `None` before trying to get its length.
5. We need to add a condition to check if `self.columns` is not `None` before accessing its length in the `copy` function.

### Bug Fix:
```python
    def copy(self, cursor, f):
        """
        Defines copying from s3 into redshift.
    
        If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
        """
        logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
        colnames = ''
        if self.columns is not None and len(self.columns) > 0:  # Check if self.columns is not None
            colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
            colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)
    
        cursor.execute("""
         COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
         CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
         {options}
         ;""".format(
            table=self.table,
            colnames=colnames,
            source=f,
            creds=self._credentials(),
            options=self.copy_options)
        )
```

By adding the `if self.columns is not None and len(self.columns) > 0:` check before accessing the length of `self.columns`, we ensure that the code does not throw a `TypeError` when `self.columns` is `None`. This fix will address the issue reported in the failing test.
