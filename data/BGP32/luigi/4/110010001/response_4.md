### Analysis:
1. The `copy` function within the `S3CopyToTable` class is checking the length of `self.columns`.
2. The error message indicates that an object of type `NoneType` does not have a len() attribute, causing a `TypeError`.
3. The issue arises when `self.columns` is `None`, and the code attempts to call `len()` on it.
   
### Bug Cause:
The bug is caused by not handling the case where `self.columns` is `None`, leading to a `TypeError` when attempting to check its length.

### Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, add a check for `None` before getting the length of `self.columns`. If `self.columns` is `None`, set `colnames` as an empty string.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns is not None:  # Check if columns are not None
        if len(self.columns) > 0:
            colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
            colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

By adding the check `if self.columns is not None`, the code ensures that it only tries to get the length of `self.columns` if it is not `None`, preventing the `TypeError` that was occurring previously.
