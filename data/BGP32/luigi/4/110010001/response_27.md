### Analysis:
1. The provided buggy function `copy` is within the `S3CopyToTable` class in the `luigi.contrib.redshift.py` file.
2. The error message indicates that a `TypeError` is being raised when trying to get the length of `self.columns`, which is a `NoneType` object.
3. The cause of the bug is that the `columns` attribute is `None` when it should be a list of columns to be copied. This results in a `NoneType` object having no length.
4. To fix the bug, we need to check if `self.columns` is `None` before trying to get its length. If it is `None`, we can handle it appropriately.
5. The corrected version of the function will include a check for `None` before attempting to get the length of `self.columns`.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns is not None:  # Check if self.columns is not None
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
``` 

By adding the `if self.columns is not None:` check, we ensure that the code will handle the case where `self.columns` is `None` and prevent the `TypeError` from occurring.
