1. The buggy function `copy` is part of the `S3CopyToTable` class in the `luigi/contrib/redshift.py` file. This class is used for inserting a data set into Redshift from S3.

2. The potential error location within the `copy` function is the line where it checks the length of `self.columns`, which is causing an error due to `self.columns` being `None`.

3. The error occurs because the `copy` function tries to access the length of `self.columns` without checking if `self.columns` is `None`. This results in a `TypeError` since `NoneType` does not have a length. The failing test tries to execute the `copy` function with `columns=None`, triggering the error.

4. To fix this bug, we need to add a null check for `self.columns` before trying to access its length. If `self.columns` is `None`, we can handle it appropriately (e.g., setting `colnames` to an empty string).

5. Below is the corrected version of the `copy` function:

```python
    def copy(self, cursor, f):
        """
        Defines copying from S3 into Redshift.

        If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
        """
        logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
        colnames = ''
        
        if self.columns is not None and len(self.columns) > 0:
            colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
            colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)
            
        cursor.execute("""
         COPY {table} {colnames} FROM '{source}'
         CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
         {options}
         ;""".format(
            table=self.table,
            colnames=colnames,
            source=f,
            creds=self._credentials(),
            options=self.copy_options)
        )
```

In the corrected version, we added a null check for `self.columns` before checking its length. This prevents the `TypeError` when `self.columns` is `None`. Now, if `self.columns` is `None`, `colnames` will be an empty string.
