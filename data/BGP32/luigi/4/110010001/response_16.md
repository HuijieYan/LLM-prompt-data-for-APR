### Analysis
The error occurs in the `copy` function of the `S3CopyToTable` class. The error message indicates a `TypeError` caused by trying to get the length of `None` type object in the `if len(self.columns) > 0:` line. This is because `self.columns` is passed as `None`, which doesn't have a length.

### Bug in the Code
The bug in the code is that the `columns` attribute is being passed as `None`, and the code does not handle this case gracefully.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug
We need to check if the `columns` attribute is `None` before trying to access its length. If `columns` is `None`, we should handle that case appropriately to prevent the `TypeError`.

### Corrected Version of the Code
```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:  # Check if columns is not None before accessing length
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )

```

By adding `if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:`, we ensure that the code only tries to access the length of `columns` if it is not `None`. This will prevent the `TypeError` when `columns` is `None`.
