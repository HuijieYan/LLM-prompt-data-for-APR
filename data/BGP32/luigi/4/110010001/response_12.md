### Analysis:
The buggy function `copy` within the `S3CopyToTable` class in the `luigi.contrib.redshift` module is attempting to check the length of the `self.columns` attribute, but it encounters a `TypeError` due to `self.columns` being `None` when it tries to access its length using `len()`.

### Error:
The error occurs when trying to get the length of `self.columns` which is `None`, resulting in a `TypeError`.

### Bug Location:
The bug is located in the line:
```python
if len(self.columns) > 0:
```

### Cause of the Bug:
The error occurs because `self.columns` is `None`, and it's not handled properly before checking its length.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix this bug, we can check if `self.columns` is `None` before trying to access its length. If `self.columns` is `None`, we can set `colnames` to an empty string directly. This way, we avoid the `TypeError` when trying to get the length of `None`.

### Updated/Copied Version:
```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    
    if self.columns is not None:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

By checking if `self.columns` is `None` before attempting to access its length, we prevent the `TypeError` from occurring in the corrected version of the `copy` function.
