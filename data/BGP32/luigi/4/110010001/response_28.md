### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `copy` in the `S3CopyToTable` class is trying to access the `columns` attribute of the class instance `self` without checking if it's `None` or not. This leads to a `TypeError` when trying to call `len(None)` in the line `if len(self.columns) > 0:`.
2. The error message indicates that the `columns` attribute is of type `NoneType`, causing the mentioned `TypeError`.
3. The cause of the bug is accessing the `columns` attribute without checking if it's `None` or not, which leads to the `TypeError` when trying to get its length.
4. To fix the bug, we need to add a check to handle the case when `columns` is `None` before trying to access its length using `len()`.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
1. Before attempting to access the length of `self.columns`, we should first check if `self.columns` is not `None`.
2. If `self.columns` is `None`, handle this condition appropriately to avoid the `TypeError`.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:  # Check if self.columns is not None before accessing its length
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

With this correction, the function will first check if `self.columns` is not `None` before trying to access its length. This will prevent the `TypeError` when `columns` is `None`.
