### Analysis:
1. The error occurs during the comparison of the length of `self.columns` which is `None`.
2. The error message indicates that `TypeError` is raised because a `NoneType` object has no `len()` method.
3. The buggy function `copy()` tries to retrieve the length of `self.columns` without checking if it is not `None`.
4. To fix this bug, we need to ensure that `self.columns` is not `None` before trying to access its length.

### Strategy for Bug Fix:
1. Check if `self.columns` is not `None` before using it in the length comparison.
2. If `self.columns` is `None`, handle this case appropriately to avoid the `TypeError`.

### Corrected Version:
```python
# The corrected version of the function
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    
    if self.columns is not None and len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

By adding the conditional `if self.columns is not None and len(self.columns) > 0:` before accessing the length of `self.columns`, we ensure that the code does not raise a `TypeError` when `self.columns` is `None`. This change ensures that the function will handle `self.columns` gracefully even if it is not provided.
