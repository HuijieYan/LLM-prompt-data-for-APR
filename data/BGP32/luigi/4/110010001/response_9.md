1. The `copy` function within the `S3CopyToTable` class is attempting to access the `columns` attribute without checking if it is `None` or has a valid value. This causes the code to break when trying to get the length of the `None` type object.

2. The potential error location is at the line: `if len(self.columns) > 0:`

3. The cause of the bug is that the `columns` attribute is not being properly checked for `None` values before trying to access its length. In this case, the `columns` attribute is set to `None` in the failing test, hence when it tries to check the length, it results in a `TypeError`.

4. To fix the bug, we need to add a check to ensure that `self.columns` is not `None` before attempting to access its length.

5. Here is the corrected version of the `copy` function:
```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    
    if self.columns is not None and len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options
    ))
```

By adding the `if self.columns is not None and len(self.columns) > 0:` check, we ensure that we only try to access the length of `self.columns` if it is not `None`. This modification prevents the `TypeError` from occurring and resolves the bug.
