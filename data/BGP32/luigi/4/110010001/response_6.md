### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `copy` in the `S3CopyToTable` class is trying to determine the length of the `columns` attribute. 
2. In the failing test, the `columns` attribute is set to `None`, causing a `TypeError` when trying to use `len(self.columns)`.
3. The error message indicates that it is trying to get the length of a `NoneType` object, which is causing the `TypeError`.
4. To fix the bug, we need to check if `self.columns` is `None` before trying to get its length, and handle this case appropriately.

### Bug Fix:
Here is the corrected version of the `copy` function in the `S3CopyToTable` class:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns is not None and len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

Now, in the corrected version, we are first checking if `self.columns` is not `None` before attempting to get its length. This change ensures that the code won't throw a `TypeError` when `self.columns` is `None`. The function can now handle this case gracefully without causing an error.
