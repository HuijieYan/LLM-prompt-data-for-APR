### Analysis:
The error message indicates a `TypeError: object of type 'NoneType' has no len()`. This error occurs when trying to access the length of a `NoneType` object, which is not allowed in Python.

Looking at the `copy` function in the `S3CopyToTable` class, the buggy part is when it checks the length of `self.columns`. If `self.columns` is `None`, it raises this error because `None` does not have a length.

### Bug:
The bug is in the line `if len(self.columns) > 0:` where it doesn't handle the case where `self.columns` is `None`. 

### Fix:
To fix this bug, we need to check if `self.columns` is `None` before trying to get its length. If `self.columns` is not `None`, then we can proceed to get the length and construct the `colnames` string.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns is not None and len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

By adding the check `if self.columns is not None and len(self.columns) > 0:` before accessing the length of `self.columns`, we ensure that the code handles the case when `self.columns` is `None`. This fix will prevent the `TypeError` from occurring in the future.
