### Analysis:
The error message indicates that the code is trying to call `len()` on a `NoneType` object which causes a `TypeError`.

### Identifying the Bug:
The bug is within the `copy` method of the `S3CopyToTable` class. The code attempts to check the length of `self.columns` without validating if it is `None` or not, which leads to the `TypeError`.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is caused by not handling the case when `self.columns` is `None`. In our test scenario, `columns` is passed as `None`, resulting in the error when the `if len(self.columns) > 0` check is performed.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
The fix involves checking if `self.columns` is `None` before attempting to get its length. If `self.columns` is `None`, we should handle this case appropriately.

### Corrected Version:
Here is the corrected version of the `copy` method:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns is not None and len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

In the corrected version, we added a check `if self.columns is not None:` before checking the length, avoiding the `TypeError` when `self.columns` is `None`. This fix ensures that the code runs smoothly even when `columns` is `None`.
