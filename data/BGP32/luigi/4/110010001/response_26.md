### Analysis:
1. The `copy` function in the `S3CopyToTable` class is attempting to check the length of `self.columns`, but it fails when `self.columns` is `None` since `NoneType` does not have a length. This causes a `TypeError` to be raised during the execution.
2. The error message clearly states that an object of type 'NoneType' has no length, pointing to the line where `len(self.columns)` is being checked.
3. The bug is caused by assuming `self.columns` will always have a value before checking its length. In this case, when `columns` is not provided (it is set to `None`), the code crashes.
4. To fix the bug, we need to add a check for `None` before trying to get the length of `self.columns`.
5. In the corrected version of the function, we will add a check for `None` and set `colnames` accordingly if `columns` is not `None`.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns is not None:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

By adding the check `if self.columns is not None`, we ensure that the code will only try to get the length of `self.columns` if it is not `None`. This prevents the `TypeError` from occurring when `columns` is not provided.
