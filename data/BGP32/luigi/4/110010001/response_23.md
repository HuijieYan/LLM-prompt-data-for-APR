### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `copy` in the `S3CopyToTable` class is attempting to access the `columns` attribute to determine if there are any columns defined for the copy operation.
2. The error message indicates a `TypeError` due to trying to get the length of `NoneType`.
3. The cause of the bug is that when the `columns` attribute is not provided, it defaults to `None`, and the function is unable to check the length of `None` using `len`.
4. To fix the bug, we need to handle the case where `self.columns` is `None` before trying to access its length.
5. We can add a check for `None` before attempting to determine the length of `self.columns`.

### Corrected Version:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns is not None and len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
``` 

In the corrected version, we added `if self.columns is not None and` before checking the length of `self.columns`. This change ensures that the function won't throw a `TypeError` when `columns` is `None`.
