### Analysis:
1. The `copy` function in the `S3CopyToTable` class in the `luigi.contrib.redshift` module is attempting to check the length of `self.columns` without handling the case where `self.columns` is `None`.
2. The error occurs because when `self.columns` is `None`, it cannot be checked for length using `len()`.
3. The bug is caused by the assumption that `self.columns` will always be a list or contain some values. The error message clearly states that it is trying to get the length of a `NoneType` object.
4. To fix the bug, we need to add a check to verify if `self.columns` is not `None` before attempting to get the length of it.
5. Here is the corrected version of the `copy` function:

### Corrected Version:
```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:  # Check if self.columns is not None before checking length
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

By adding the condition `if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:`, we ensure that `self.columns` is not `None` before attempting to get its length. This change will prevent the `TypeError` encountered when `self.columns` is `None`.
