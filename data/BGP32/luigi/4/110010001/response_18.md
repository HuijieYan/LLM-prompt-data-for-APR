### Analysis
1. The `copy` function within the `S3CopyToTable` class is trying to access the `self.columns` attribute, which is causing an error when the attribute is `None`.
2. The error message indicates a `TypeError` due to trying to get the length of a `NoneType` object.
3. The cause of the bug is that the `columns` attribute is not checked for `None` before trying to take its length, leading to the error when `columns` is `None`.
4. To fix the bug, we need to add a check to ensure that `self.columns` is not `None` before trying to access its length.

### Correction

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns is not None and len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

By adding a check `if self.columns is not None` before trying to access the length of `self.columns`, we prevent the `TypeError` when `columns` is `None`.
