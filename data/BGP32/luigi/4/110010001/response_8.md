1. The buggy function `copy` is within the class `S3CopyToTable` in the luigi/contrib/redshift.py file. The test case `test_s3_copy_with_nonetype_columns` in contrib/redshift_test.py is failing with a TypeError due to the comparison `len(self.columns) > 0` where `self.columns` is `None`.

2. The potential error location is the comparison `len(self.columns) > 0` which raises a TypeError when `self.columns` is `None`.

3. The bug occurs because the code is trying to get the length (`len`) of `self.columns`, which is `None`. This results in a TypeError `'NoneType' has no len()` as `None` does not have a length. This bug is causing the failing test.

4. To fix the bug, we need to handle the case where `self.columns` is `None` separately before trying to get its length. We can add a check to see if `self.columns` is `None` and then decide how to proceed based on that condition.

5. Here is the corrected version of the `copy` function with a check for `None` columns:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns is not None:  # Check if columns is not None before getting its length
        if len(self.columns) > 0:
            colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
            colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

By adding the check `if self.columns is not None` before trying to get the length of `self.columns`, we avoid the TypeError when `self.columns` is `None`. This corrected version of the function should now handle the case where `columns` is `None` without causing any errors.
