## Analysis:
- The `S3CopyToTable` class is a template task for inserting a dataset into Redshift from S3.
- The `copy` method within the class is responsible for copying data from S3 to Redshift.
- The error occurs when `self.columns` is `None`, resulting in a `TypeError` when trying to get the length of `None`.

## Error Cause:
- The error occurs because the `columns` attribute is being set to `None` in the `DummyS3CopyToTableKey` instance used in the failing test.
- The copy function tries to determine the column names using `self.columns`, but since it is `None`, a `TypeError` is raised.

## Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to modify the `copy` function to handle the case where `self.columns` is `None`. The function should first check if `self.columns` is not `None` before trying to access its length.

## Corrected Version:
```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from S3 into Redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns is not None and len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

With this modification, the function first checks if `self.columns` is not `None` before proceeding to use it to determine the column names. This change ensures that the function won't encounter a `TypeError` when `self.columns` is `None`.
