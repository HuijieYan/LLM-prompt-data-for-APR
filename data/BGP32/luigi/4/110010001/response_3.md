### Analysis:
- The `copy` function within the `S3CopyToTable` class is trying to extract column names from `self.columns`.
- The error message indicates that there is a `TypeError` because `self.columns` is `None`.
- The `if` condition checks if `self.columns` has a length greater than 0, but when `self.columns` is `None`, it raises an error because `None` does not have a length.

### Bug Cause:
- The bug occurs because `self.columns` is assigned as `None` which is not handled in the `copy` function causing a `TypeError` when trying to check the length.

### Fix Strategy:
- To fix the bug, we need to handle the case when `self.columns` is `None` in the `copy` function.

### Corrected Version:
```python
class S3CopyToTable(rdbms.CopyToTable, _CredentialsMixin):
    def copy(self, cursor, f):
        """
        Defines copying from s3 into redshift.
    
        If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
        """
        logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
        colnames = ''
        if self.columns is not None:  # Check if self.columns is not None before accessing its length
            if len(self.columns) > 0:
                colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
                colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)
    
        cursor.execute("""
         COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
         CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
         {options}
         ;""".format(
            table=self.table,
            colnames=colnames,
            source=f,
            creds=self._credentials(),
            options=self.copy_options)
        )
```

By adding a check to see if `self.columns` is not `None` before attempting to access its length, we can prevent the `TypeError` from occurring. This corrected version should resolve the issue mentioned in the error message.
