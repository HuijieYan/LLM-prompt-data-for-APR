The buggy function `copy` within the `S3CopyToTable` class is failing with a `TypeError` because it is trying to check the length of `self.columns` without handling the case when `self.columns` is `None`. This error occurs when the `columns` parameter is not provided when creating an instance of the `S3CopyToTable` class.

To fix this bug, we need to ensure that `self.columns` is checked for `None` before attempting to find its length. If `self.columns` is `None`, we should handle this case gracefully to avoid the `TypeError`.

Here is the corrected version of the `copy` function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    
    if self.columns is not None and len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)
    else:
        colnames = ''

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

In the corrected version, we first check if `self.columns` is not `None` before trying to find its length. If `self.columns` is `None`, we set `colnames` to an empty string. This fix ensures that the `TypeError` is avoided when `self.columns` is `None`.

This corrected version should now pass the failing test.
