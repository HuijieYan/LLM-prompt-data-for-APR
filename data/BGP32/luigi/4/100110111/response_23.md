### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `copy` in the `luigi/contrib/redshift.py` file is failing due to a `TypeError` when trying to check the length of `self.columns` where `self.columns` is `None`.
2. The test case `test_s3_copy_with_nonetype_columns` is trying to run the task `DummyS3CopyToTableKey` with `columns` set to `None`, triggering the bug.
3. The expected behavior is that when `columns` is `None`, colnames should be an empty string.
4. The GitHub issue describes this bug and suggests a possible fix by checking `if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0`.

### Bug Cause:
The bug occurs because the code tries to check the length of `self.columns` without verifying if it is `None`. When `self.columns` is `None`, trying to get its length results in a `TypeError`.

### Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to check if `self.columns` is not `None` before trying to get its length. This will prevent the `TypeError` when `self.columns` is `None`.

### Corrected Function:
Here is the corrected version of the `copy` function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:  # Check if self.columns is not None before getting length
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

By adding the `if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:` check, we ensure safe handling of `self.columns` being `None`. This fix should address the `TypeError` and make the function work as expected.
