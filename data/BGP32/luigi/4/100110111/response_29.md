### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `copy` is attempting to access the `columns` attribute of `self` without validating if it's `None`, which results in a `TypeError` when trying to get the length of a `NoneType` object.
2. The error occurs in the `if len(self.columns) > 0:` line inside the `copy` function.
3. The failing test `test_s3_copy_with_nonetype_columns` creates a `DummyS3CopyToTableKey` task with `columns` set to `None`, which leads to the error when calling `task.run()`.
4. To fix the bug, we need to modify the condition to check if `self.columns` is not `None` before attempting to get its length.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
Update the condition `if len(self.columns) > 0:` to `if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:` to prevent accessing the length of `NoneType`.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

By making this change, the function will first check if `self.columns` is not `None` before trying to retrieve its length, resolving the `TypeError` issue.
