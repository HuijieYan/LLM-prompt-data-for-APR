### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `copy` in `luigi/contrib/redshift.py` is failing due to a TypeError raised when trying to get the length of `self.columns`, which is None.
2. The failing test `test_s3_copy_with_nonetype_columns` in `test/contrib/redshift_test.py` sets `columns` to None for the task and expects an empty `colnames` in the SQL query executed by the `copy` function.
3. The existing code does not handle the case where `self.columns` is None, causing the TypeError. The GitHub issue provides insight into the root cause and suggests a potential fix to check explicitly if `self.columns` is not None before checking its length.
4. To fix the bug, we need to modify the `if` condition to check for `self.columns` being not None before trying to get its length. This will prevent the TypeError when `columns` is None.
5. The corrected version of the `copy` function is provided below.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns is not None:  # Check if columns is not None
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

By explicitly checking if `self.columns` is not None before using it to build `colnames`, we avoid the TypeError and ensure the function handles the scenario where `columns` is None correctly.
