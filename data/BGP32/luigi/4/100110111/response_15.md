### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `copy` in the `luigi/contrib/redshift.py` file fails when `self.columns` is `None`.
2. The failing test `test_s3_copy_with_nonetype_columns` in the `test/contrib/redshift_test.py` file creates a `DummyS3CopyToTableKey` task with `columns` set to `None`.
3. The error occurs due to trying to call `len()` on a `NoneType` object in the buggy function.
4. The expected input/output values and types are analyzed for the failing test case.
5. The related GitHub issue "Redshift COPY fails in luigi 2.7.1 when columns are not provided" provides context and a suggested solution.

### Bug Cause:
The buggy function tries to get the length of `self.columns` without checking if it is `None`, leading to a `TypeError` when `self.columns` is `None`. The failing test specifies `columns=None`, triggering this error.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
1. Modify the `if` condition to check if `self.columns` is not `None` before checking its length to avoid the `TypeError`.
2. Refactor the code to handle the case when `columns` is `None` appropriately.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

By checking if `self.columns` is not `None` before getting its length, the corrected function will prevent the `TypeError` when `columns` is `None`. The function will now handle `columns` being `None` as expected.
