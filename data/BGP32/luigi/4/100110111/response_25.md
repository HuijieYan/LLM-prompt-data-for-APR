### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `copy` in `luigi/contrib/redshift.py` is causing a `TypeError` due to trying to get the length of `self.columns`, which is `None`.
2. The failing test `test_s3_copy_with_nonetype_columns` in `test/contrib/redshift_test.py` sets `columns=None` for the `DummyS3CopyToTableKey` object, triggering the bug.
3. The error message indicates that a `TypeError` is raised at line 338 in `luigi/contrib/redshift.py` while trying to get the length of `self.columns`. The expected value for `self.columns` during this test is `None`, causing the error.
4. To fix the bug, we need to check if `self.columns` is not `None` before trying to get its length. The suggested solution in the GitHub issue proposes this change.
5. The corrected version of the `copy` function will include the suggested fix to avoid the `TypeError`.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:  # Check if self.columns is not None
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

This corrected version of the function includes the check `if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0` to ensure that the length operation is only performed when `self.columns` is not `None`, addressing the `TypeError` issue.
