Based on the analysis of the buggy function, the error occurs when the `columns` attribute is set to `None` in the `DummyS3CopyToTableKey` task. This causes the `TypeError: object of type 'NoneType' has no len()` because the buggy function is trying to determine the length of `self.columns`.

To fix this bug, we can modify the condition to check if `self.columns` is not None before trying to get its length.

Here is the corrected version of the `copy` function:

```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: luigi/contrib/redshift.py

# corrected version of the buggy function
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns is not None and len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

By checking if `self.columns` is not None before accessing its length, we prevent the `TypeError` when `columns` is set to `None`. This change aligns with the suggested solution in the GitHub issue by adding `self.columns is not None` in the conditional check.

With this corrected version, the function should now pass the failing test and satisfy the expected input/output values provided.
