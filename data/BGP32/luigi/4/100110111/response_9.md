### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `copy` in the `luigi/contrib/redshift.py` file is expecting `self.columns` to be a list. If `self.columns` is `None`, it tries to access its length, which results in a `TypeError` because `NoneType` objects do not have a length.
2. The failing test `test_s3_copy_with_nonetype_columns` creates a task `DummyS3CopyToTableKey` with `columns=None`, triggering the bug in the `copy` function.
3. The `TypeError` is raised because the `self.columns` parameter is `None`, causing the `if len(self.columns) > 0` condition to fail.
4. To fix the bug, we need to check if `self.columns` is not `None` before trying to access its length.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
Check if `self.columns` is not `None` before attempting to access its length.

### Corrected Version of the `copy` function:
```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:  # Check if self.columns is not None
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

This corrected version adds a check `if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0` to ensure that `self.columns` is not `None` before trying to access its length. This modification will prevent the `TypeError` when `self.columns` is `None`.
