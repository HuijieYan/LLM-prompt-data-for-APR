### Analysis:
- The buggy function `copy` in the `luigi/contrib/redshift.py` file is attempting to check if the `self.columns` attribute is not `None` before proceeding to use it in the `colnames` variable. However, the current implementation directly calls `len(self.columns)` without first checking if `self.columns` is `None`, leading to a `TypeError` when `columns` is `None`.
- The failing test function `test_s3_copy_with_nonetype_columns` from `test/contrib/redshift_test.py` is testing the `copy` method with `columns=None`.
- The expected input/output values are well-defined, including the expected values and types of various variables during the function execution.
- The related GitHub issue highlights the problem and suggests a potential solution.

### Bug Cause:
The bug occurs because the code does not handle the case where `self.columns` is `None`, leading to a `TypeError: object of type 'NoneType' has no len()` when attempting to get the length of a `NoneType` object.

### Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to first check if `self.columns` is not `None` before proceeding to extract the column names from it. We can modify the condition to `if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0` to account for both cases.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

By incorporating the suggested fix into the `copy` method, we ensure that the code handles the case where `self.columns` might be `None`, hence resolving the `TypeError` issue encountered in the failing test case.
