### Analysis
1. The buggy function `copy` in `luigi/contrib/redshift.py` is trying to construct a `COPY` SQL statement to load data from S3 into Redshift. The issue arises when the `self.columns` attribute is `None`, as the code attempts to check its length causing a `TypeError`.
2. The failing test `test_s3_copy_with_nonetype_columns` in `test/contrib/redshift_test.py` sets the `columns` attribute of the task to `None` to trigger this bug.
3. The expected behavior is to not create a column list in the SQL statement when `self.columns` is `None`.
4. The bug was reported on GitHub in issue #2245 and a potential fix is suggested in the description.

### Bug Cause
The bug occurs because the buggy code does not handle the case when `self.columns` is `None` properly, resulting in a `TypeError`.

### Proposed Fix
Modify the `if` condition to first check if `self.columns` exists before trying to access its length. If it exists and is not `None`, then proceed with constructing the column list.

### Corrected Code
```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns is not None and len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

After making this change, the corrected function should be able to handle the case when `self.columns` is `None` and not throw a `TypeError`.
