### Analysis
The buggy function `copy` in the `luigi/contrib/redshift.py` file is expecting a list of columns (`self.columns`) to be provided. However, in the failing test `test_s3_copy_with_nonetype_columns`, the `columns` parameter is set to `None` for the `DummyS3CopyToTableKey` instance.

The error arises because the buggy function is trying to check the length of `self.columns` without verifying if it is `None`. This leads to a `TypeError` when trying to get the length of a `NoneType` object.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the conditional check to handle the case where `self.columns` is `None`.

### Bug Fix Strategy
1. Modify the conditional check to verify if `self.columns` is not None before checking its length.
2. Update the `if` condition to include a check for `None`.

### Corrected Version
```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from S3 into Redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:  # Updated conditional check
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

By updating the conditional check in the `copy` function, we can now handle the case when `self.columns` is `None` without causing a `TypeError`. This corrected version should pass the failing test `test_s3_copy_with_nonetype_columns` and satisfy the expected input/output values.
