### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `copy` in the `luigi/contrib/redshift.py` file is trying to check the length of `self.columns`, which results in a `TypeError` when `self.columns` is `None`.
2. The failing test case `test_s3_copy_with_nonetype_columns` creates an instance of `DummyS3CopyToTableKey` with `columns=None` and then calls the `run` method, which finally triggers the `copy` method with a `cursor` and a file `f`.
3. The error message clearly states that the `TypeError` occurs due to trying to get the length of a `NoneType` object.
4. As per the GitHub issue, the bug originates from a condition check that needs to be modified to handle the case when `self.columns` is `None`.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is caused by the `if len(self.columns) > 0` check in the `copy` function. When `self.columns` is `None`, it raises a `TypeError` since we can't get the length of a `NoneType` object.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to modify the condition check to avoid the `TypeError` when `self.columns` is `None`. We can change the condition to `if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0` to first check if `self.columns` is not `None` before attempting to get its length.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)
    
    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

By implementing this modification, the `copy` function will now check if `self.columns` is not `None` before trying to get its length, effectively fixing the `TypeError` issue.
