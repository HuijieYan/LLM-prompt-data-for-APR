## Analysis
The buggy function `copy` in the `luigi/contrib/redshift.py` file is causing a `TypeError` due to a comparison involving the `self.columns` attribute, which can be `None`. The failing test `test_s3_copy_with_nonetype_columns` in `test/contrib/redshift_test.py` aims to test this behavior.

### Error
The error occurs because the buggy function tries to check the length of `self.columns` without verifying if it is not `None`. This leads to a `TypeError` when `self.columns` is `None`.

### Strategy for fixing the bug
To fix this bug, we need to modify the condition checking the length of `self.columns` to first ensure that `self.columns` is not `None`. We can achieve this by changing the condition to `if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0` in order to avoid trying to get the length of a `NoneType` object.

### Corrected Version
```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

By making this change, we ensure that the buggy function will handle cases where `self.columns` is `None` correctly, preventing the `TypeError` from occurring.
