### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `copy` in the `luigi/contrib/redshift.py` file is failing due to a `TypeError` caused by calling `len(self.columns)` where `self.columns` is `None`.
2. The failing test function `test_s3_copy_with_nonetype_columns` in the `test/contrib/redshift_test.py` file creates an instance of `DummyS3CopyToTableKey` with `columns=None` and then calls the `run` method which subsequently calls the `copy` method.
3. The expected input for the failing test is a `DummyS3CopyToTableKey` instance with `columns` set to `None`, and the `copy` method should handle this case correctly by checking if `self.columns` is not `None` before trying to retrieve its length.
4. The buggy function can be fixed by adding a check `if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0` to ensure that `self.columns` is not `None` before attempting to get its length.

### Correction:
```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

By adding the check `if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0`, we ensure that `self.columns` is not `None` before trying to get its length. This correction will prevent the `TypeError` that occurred when `self.columns` was `None`.
