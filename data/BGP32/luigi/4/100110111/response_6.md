### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `copy` in the `luigi/contrib/redshift.py` file is trying to retrieve the length of `self.columns` without first checking if it's not `None`.
2. The failing test `test_s3_copy_with_nonetype_columns` is setting `columns` parameter of `DummyS3CopyToTableKey` as `None`, causing the TypeError due to `if len(self.columns) > 0` in the `copy` function.
3. The expected output is the execution of the `COPY` statement without including any column names since `columns` is set to `None`.

### Bug Cause:
The buggy function is directly trying to get the length of `self.columns` without checking if it's `None`. This results in an attempt to get the length of a NoneType object, causing the TypeError.

### Bug Fix:
We need to modify the condition before accessing the length of `self.columns` to avoid the TypeError. By checking if `self.columns` is not `None` and then verifying its length, we can ensure a safe operation.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:  # Check if columns is not None before getting length
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

By adding the condition `if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0`, we ensure that we only try to get the length of `self.columns` if it's not `None`. This modification will prevent the TypeError and successfully execute the `COPY` statement with the correct behavior.
