### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `copy` in `luigi/contrib/redshift.py` is trying to check the length of `self.columns` before processing it, but it fails with a `TypeError` when `self.columns` is `None`.
2. The failing test `test_s3_copy_with_nonetype_columns` in `test/contrib/redshift_test.py` creates an instance of `DummyS3CopyToTableKey` with `columns=None` and expects the correct behavior in the `copy` function.
3. The error message indicates the exact line where the `TypeError` occurs, which is due to trying to find the length of a `NoneType`.
4. To fix this bug, we need to update the condition to check if `self.columns` is not `None` before checking its length.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is caused by trying to check the length of `self.columns` directly without validating if it's `None`. When `self.columns` is `None`, the function crashes with a `TypeError` as it cannot find the length of a `NoneType`.

### Bug Fix:
To fix the bug, we need to modify the condition to first check if `self.columns` is not `None` before checking its length. This prevents the `TypeError` from occurring.

### Corrected Code:
```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

After applying this fix, the corrected version of the function should pass the failing test case and avoid the `TypeError` when `self.columns` is `None`.
