### Analysis:
1. The provided `copy` function in the `luigi/contrib/redshift.py` file is attempting to check the length of `self.columns`, which is causing an error when `self.columns` is `None`.
2. The failing test case `test_s3_copy_with_nonetype_columns` in `test/contrib/redshift_test.py` is invoking the `run` method of `DummyS3CopyToTableKey` with `columns=None`, triggering the error.
3. The error message indicates a `TypeError` due to trying to retrieve the length of a `NoneType` object, which aligns with the bug in the `copy` function.
4. The suggested strategy for fixing the bug is to check if `self.columns` is not `None` before attempting to get its length to avoid the `TypeError`.

### Bug Fix:
```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:  # Fix: Check if self.columns is not None
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

By adding the condition `if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:` before accessing the length of `self.columns`, we ensure that if `self.columns` is `None`, the code block will not attempt to calculate the length. This fix addresses the `TypeError` caused by trying to get the length of a `NoneType` object.

The corrected `copy` function should now pass the failing test case `test_s3_copy_with_nonetype_columns` and align with the expected input/output values for the function.
