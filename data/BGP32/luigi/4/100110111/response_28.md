### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `copy` is trying to access the length of `self.columns`, which causes an error when `self.columns` is `None`.
2. The failing test `test_s3_copy_with_nonetype_columns` creates a `DummyS3CopyToTableKey` instance with `columns=None` and expects the function to handle this case correctly.
3. The error message indicates a `TypeError` due to trying to get the length of a `NoneType` object.
4. The expected behavior is to check if `self.columns` is not `None` before accessing its length in order to handle the case where `columns` is not provided.
5. The GitHub issue explains that the bug occurs when `columns` are not provided, and a suggested solution is to check `if self.columns`.

### Fix:
To fix the bug, we need to modify the conditional check to handle the case where `self.columns` is `None`.
We can update the line `if len(self.columns) > 0:` to `if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:` to prevent the `TypeError`.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

This corrected version should now properly handle the case where `columns` are not provided, as observed in the failing test case and reported issue.
