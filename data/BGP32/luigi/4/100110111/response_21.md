### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `copy` in `luigi/contrib/redshift.py` is failing due to a `TypeError` caused by checking the length of `self.columns` without first verifying if `self.columns` is not `None`.
2. The failing test `test_s3_copy_with_nonetype_columns` in `test/contrib/redshift_test.py` sets `columns` to `None` for the task `DummyS3CopyToTableKey`, triggering the bug.
3. The bug causes the function to attempt to get the length of a `NoneType` object, resulting in the `TypeError`.
4. To fix the bug, a check for `None` should be added before checking the length of `self.columns`.
5. The corrected version should handle the case of `self.columns` being `None` in order to pass the failing test and resolve the GitHub issue regarding the error.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns is not None and len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

This corrected version includes a check for `self.columns is not None` before checking its length. This change ensures that the code does not attempt to get the length of a `NoneType` object and resolves the `TypeError` issue.
