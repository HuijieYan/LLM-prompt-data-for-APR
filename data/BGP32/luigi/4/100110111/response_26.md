### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `copy` is failing due to a `TypeError` when trying to access the length of `self.columns` which is `None`.
2. The failing test `test_s3_copy_with_nonetype_columns` creates a task with `columns=None` and expects the `colnames` to be an empty string.
3. The error message shows that the buggy line is `if len(self.columns) > 0:`, where `self.columns` is `None`.
4. The proposed solution in the GitHub issue suggests changing the error-causing line to `if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:` to handle the case when `self.columns` is `None`.

### Proposed Fix:
To fix the bug, we need to modify the `if` condition in the `copy` function to first check if `self.columns` is not `None` before trying to get its length.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

By making this change, the corrected function will handle the case when `self.columns` is `None` before trying to access its length, thus preventing the `TypeError` and ensuring that `colnames` is set correctly.
