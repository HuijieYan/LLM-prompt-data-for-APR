### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `copy` in `luigi/contrib/redshift.py` is trying to create an SQL `COPY` statement for Redshift. The failing test `test_s3_copy_with_nonetype_columns` in `test/contrib/redshift_test.py` expects the function to handle the case where `self.columns` is `None`, but the function does not handle this scenario properly.
2. The error occurs when the function tries to check the length of `self.columns` which is `None`.
3. The failing test is trying to run a task with `columns=None` and expects an SQL `COPY` statement with empty column names. The error message shows a `TypeError` due to trying to get the length of `None`.
4. The bug can be fixed by checking if `self.columns` is not `None` before trying to access its length.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we should modify the `copy` function to handle the case where `self.columns` is `None`. By checking if `self.columns` is not `None` before getting its length, we can prevent the `TypeError` from occurring. We can do this by using `if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:` instead of `if len(self.columns) > 0:`.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:  # Check if self.columns is not None before accessing its length
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

By making this change, the corrected function should now handle the case where `self.columns` is `None` without raising a `TypeError`. This fix aligns with the expectations of the failing test and resolves the GitHub issue related to this bug.
