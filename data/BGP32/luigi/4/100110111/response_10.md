### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `copy` in `luigi/contrib/redshift.py` is failing due to the `if len(self.columns) > 0` check where `self.columns` is `None`. This causes a `TypeError: object of type 'NoneType' has no len()` error.
2. The test case `test_s3_copy_with_nonetype_columns` in `test/contrib/redshift_test.py` is trying to test the behavior of the function when `columns` is `None`.
3. The expected behavior is to handle `columns=None` gracefully and execute the relevant SQL statement without any issues. The GitHub issue points out the specific problem and suggests a potential fix.
   
### Bug Cause:
The bug occurs because the code does not check if `self.columns` is not `None` before checking its length in the `copy` function.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, you need to modify the line `if len(self.columns) > 0` to `if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0` to ensure that the check for length is only done when `self.columns` is not `None`.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
# The corrected version of the copy function
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

By making this change, the function will now correctly handle the case where `self.columns=None` and prevent the `TypeError` that was causing the test to fail.
