### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `copy` in the `luigi/contrib/redshift.py` file is failing due to trying to access the length of `self.columns`, which is `None`. This causes a `TypeError: object of type 'NoneType' has no len()` error.
2. The failing test `test_s3_copy_with_nonetype_columns` in `test/contrib/redshift_test.py` is mocking the `DummyS3CopyToTableKey` task with `columns=None`, triggering the bug.
3. The expected input/output values indicate that if `self.columns` is `None`, then `colnames` should remain an empty string.
4. The bug was reported on GitHub as issue #2245, mentioning that passing `None` as columns to prohibit table creation causes the bug.

### Bug Cause:
The root cause of the bug is that the condition `if len(self.columns) > 0:` is not handling the case where `self.columns` is `None`. It should first check if `self.columns` exists (`self.columns is not None`) before evaluating its length.

### Solution:
To fix the bug, we need to modify the condition in the `copy` function to handle the `None` case before checking the length of `self.columns`.

### Corrected Function:
```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns is not None and len(self.columns) > 0:  # Check if self.columns is not None before getting length
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

By updating the conditional check to include `self.columns is not None`, we ensure that the code does not attempt to access the length of a `None` type, fixing the bug. This corrected version should now handle the case where `self.columns` is `None` and pass the failing test.
