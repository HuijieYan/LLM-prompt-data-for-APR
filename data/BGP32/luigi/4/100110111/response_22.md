### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `copy` in `luigi/contrib/redshift.py` fails to handle the case where `self.columns` is `None`. This leads to a `TypeError` when trying to check the length of `self.columns`.
2. The failing test `test_s3_copy_with_nonetype_columns` in `test/contrib/redshift_test.py` provides a scenario where `columns` is set to `None`.
3. The error message indicates `TypeError: object of type 'NoneType' has no len()`, which aligns with the buggy function trying to check the length of `None`.
4. The expected behavior is when `self.columns` is `None`, it should not try to check its length and proceed with an empty `colnames`.

### Bug Cause:
The bug occurs because the buggy function does not account for the case where `self.columns` can be `None`, leading to a `TypeError` when trying to get the length of `None`.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we should first check if `self.columns` is not `None` before attempting to get its length and construct the `colnames` accordingly.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns is not None and len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

With this correction, the function will first check if `self.columns` is not `None` before attempting to get its length, effectively fixing the bug. This corrected version should pass the failing test and address the GitHub issue related to the bug.
