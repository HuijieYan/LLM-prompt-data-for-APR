# The corrected version of the buggy function

```python
    def copy(self, cursor, f):
        """
        Defines copying from s3 into redshift.
    
        If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
        """
        logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
        colnames = ''
        if self.columns is not None and len(self.columns) > 0:
            colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
            colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)
    
        cursor.execute("""
         COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
         CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
         {options}
         ;""".format(
            table=self.table,
            colnames=colnames,
            source=f,
            creds=self._credentials(),
            options=self.copy_options())
        )
```

Explanation of Changes:
1. The bug was caused by assuming `self.columns` would always be a list, leading to an error when it was set to `None`. 
2. I have modified the `if` condition to check if `self.columns` is not `None` before checking its length to avoid the `NoneType` error.
3. I have also added parentheses to call the `copy_options` method properly.

By making these changes, the function should now work correctly and pass the failing test, resolving the issue reported on GitHub.
