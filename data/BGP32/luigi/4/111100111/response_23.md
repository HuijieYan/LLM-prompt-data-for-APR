## Analysis:
1. The buggy function `copy` within the `S3CopyToTable` class of `luigi.contrib.redshift.py` is not handling the case where `self.columns` is `None`, leading to the TypeError.
2. The bug arises due to the check `if len(self.columns) > 0` without checking if `self.columns` is not None.
3. The failing test `test_s3_copy_with_nonetype_columns` aims to test the behavior when `self.columns` is None. The expected behavior is that the `colnames` variable should be an empty string when `self.columns` is None.
4. To fix the bug, we should first check if `self.columns` is not None before checking its length in the `copy` function.

## Bug Fix:
```python
# The buggy function 'copy' is fixed below:

class S3CopyToTable(rdbms.CopyToTable, _CredentialsMixin):
    """
    Template task for inserting a data set into Redshift from s3.
    
    Usage:
    
    * Subclass and override the required attributes:
    
      * `host`,
      * `database`,
      * `user`,
      * `password`,
      * `table`,
      * `columns`,
      * `s3_load_path`.
    
    * You can also override the attributes provided by the
      CredentialsMixin if they are not supplied by your
      configuration or environment variables.
    """


    # This function from the same class is called by the buggy function
    def copy_options(self):
        # Please ignore the body of this function



    # The bug-fixed version of the copy function
    def copy(self, cursor, f):
        """
        Defines copying from s3 into redshift.
    
        If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
        """
        logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
        colnames = ''
        if self.columns is not None and len(self.columns) > 0:
            colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
            colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)
    
        cursor.execute("""
         COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
         CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
         {options}
         ;""".format(
            table=self.table,
            colnames=colnames,
            source=f,
            creds=self._credentials(),
            options=self.copy_options)
        )
```

After implementing this fix, the `copy` function will handle cases where `self.columns` is `None` properly, thus resolving the TypeError. The corrected function should now pass the failing test case `test_s3_copy_with_nonetype_columns`.
