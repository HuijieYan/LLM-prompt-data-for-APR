## Analysis:
1. The buggy function `copy` inside the `S3CopyToTable` class is attempting to execute a Redshift `COPY` command, but it is failing when `self.columns` is `None`.
2. The issue arises because the code directly tries to access the length of `self.columns` without checking if it is `None` first.
3. The failing test `test_s3_copy_with_nonetype_columns` checks that the `COPY` command is executed properly with an empty `colnames` when `columns` is `None`.
4. To fix the bug, we need to modify the condition for checking the length of `self.columns` to prevent the `NoneType` error.

## Bug Fix Strategy:
Modify the condition for checking the length of `self.columns` to avoid the `NoneType` error. If `self.columns` is not `None`, then proceed to generate `colnames` by joining the column names.

## Corrected Version:
```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    
    if self.columns is not None and len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options())
    )
```

By updating the condition to `if self.columns is not None and len(self.columns) > 0`, we ensure that the length of `self.columns` is only accessed when it is not `None`, preventing the `NoneType` error. Now the corrected version should pass the failing test and address the issue reported in GitHub.
