## Analysis:
1. The buggy function `copy()` is part of the `S3CopyToTable` class in the `luigi.contrib.redshift` module.
2. The issue seems to be related to the `if len(self.columns) > 0:` condition, where if `self.columns` is `None`, it raises a `TypeError`.
3. The failing test `test_s3_copy_with_nonetype_columns` creates a task with `columns=None` and expects an empty `colnames` in the `COPY` SQL query.
4. The GitHub issue indicates that the bug is due to the assumption of `self.columns` always being a list in the condition check.
5. The suggested solution would be to change the condition to `if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:` to prevent the `TypeError`.

## Bug Fix:
To fix the bug, we need to modify the condition that checks the length of `self.columns`. If `self.columns` is `None`, we should not proceed with extracting column names.

Here is the corrected version of the `copy()` function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

By checking if `self.columns` is not `None` before trying to get its length, we prevent the `TypeError` that was occurring when `self.columns` is `None`.

With this fix, the function should now work correctly as expected without raising any errors and pass the failing test case.
