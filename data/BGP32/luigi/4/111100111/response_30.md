### Analysis:
1. The `copy` function is responsible for performing the COPY operation in Redshift from an s3 source. It constructs an SQL query string and attempts to execute it through the `cursor` object passed as a parameter.
2. The issue arises due to the assumption made about the `self.columns` attribute. If `self.columns` is `None`, the code tries to calculate its length without checking if it is not `None`.
3. The failing test is attempting to test the scenario where `columns` is `None` and expects an empty `colnames` in the query. However, the code fails due to the incorrect handling of `self.columns` when it is `None`.
4. To fix the bug, we need to check if `self.columns` is not `None` before trying to calculate the length.

### Solution:
I will modify the if condition to explicitly check if `self.columns` is not `None` before calculating its length in the `copy` function.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:  # Check if self.columns is not None
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options())
    )
```

The correction involves checking `self.columns` for `None` before calculating its length to prevent the TypeError.
