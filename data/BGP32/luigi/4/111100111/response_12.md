## Analysis:
1. The buggy function `copy` in the `S3CopyToTable` class is called to define copying data from S3 into Redshift.
2. The bug seems to be related to handling the `self.columns` attribute when it is `None`.
3. The failing test `test_s3_copy_with_nonetype_columns` creates an object `DummyS3CopyToTableKey` with `columns=None` and tests if the `COPY` SQL statement constructed in the `copy` function matches the expected values.
4. The GitHub issue indicates that the bug arises when `columns=None` is provided, leading to a TypeError due to trying to get the length of `None`.
5. The suggested solution in the GitHub issue recommends checking if `self.columns` is not None before trying to get its length.

## Bug Fix Strategy:
- Modify the `copy` function to check if `self.columns` is not None before attempting to construct the `colnames` string.
- If `self.columns` is not None, then construct the `colnames` string based on the columns provided, otherwise leave `colnames` as an empty string.
- Re-run the failing test to ensure that the bug is fixed.

## Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns is not None:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options())
    )
```

This corrected version checks if `self.columns` is not None before constructing the `colnames` string, which prevents the TypeError when `columns=None`. Make sure to retest the function with the provided failing test to verify that the bug is fixed.
