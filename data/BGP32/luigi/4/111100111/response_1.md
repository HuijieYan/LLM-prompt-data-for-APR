### Analysis
1. The buggy function `copy` within the class `S3CopyToTable` in the file `luigi/contrib/redshift.py` is responsible for copying data from S3 to Redshift.
2. The bug seems related to the handling of the `columns` attribute when it is set to `None`.
3. The failing test `test_s3_copy_with_nonetype_columns` in `test/contrib/redshift_test.py` checks for the behavior when `columns=None`.
4. The bug causes a `TypeError: object of type 'NoneType' has no len()` when trying to determine the length of `self.columns`.
5. The suggested fix from the GitHub issue involves changing the condition to `if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0` to handle the case where `columns` is `None`.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to modify the condition for checking the length of `self.columns`. By including a check to ensure `self.columns` is not `None` before checking its length, we can prevent the `TypeError`.

### Corrected Version

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options())
    )
```

In the corrected version:
- We added a check `if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0` before trying to process `self.columns`.
- Used `self.copy_options()` to call the method correctly for providing copy options.
- This fix should prevent the `TypeError` when `columns` is `None` and allow the function to execute correctly with the expected behavior.
