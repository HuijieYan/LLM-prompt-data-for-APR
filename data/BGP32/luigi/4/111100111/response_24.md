## Analysis
1. The `copy` function in the `S3CopyToTable` class is supposed to copy data from S3 to Redshift. It constructs a `COPY` SQL query using various attributes of the class (`table`, `columns`, `source`, etc.) and executes it using the provided `cursor`.
2. The bug seems to be related to handling the `columns` attribute when it is set to `None`. The function tries to use the length of `self.columns` without checking if it is `None`, leading to a `NoneType` error as highlighted in the GitHub issue.
3. The failing test case is configured to create a `DummyS3CopyToTableKey` instance with `columns=None` and expects the `colnames` variable to be an empty string.
4. To fix the bug, we need to update the logic in the `copy` function to properly handle the case where `self.columns` is `None`.
5. Updating the condition to check if `self.columns` is not `None` before trying to get its length will prevent the `NoneType` error.

## Bug Fix
```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:  # Updated condition to check if self.columns is not None
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options())
    )
```

With this update, the `copy` function will first check if `self.columns` is not `None` before attempting to get its length or construct the `colnames` string. This change ensures that the function handles the case where `columns` is `None` correctly and should resolve the `NoneType` error described in the GitHub issue.
