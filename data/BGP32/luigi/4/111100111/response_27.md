### Analyzing the buggy function and identifying potential error locations:

1. The `copy` function in the `S3CopyToTable` class is intended to perform copying from S3 into Redshift.
2. The function constructs an SQL query using various attributes of the class such as `table`, `columns`, `source`, `creds`, and `copy_options`.
3. There is a potential error in constructing the `colnames` string where it assumes `self.columns` is always a non-empty list, leading to a `TypeError` if `self.columns` is `None`.
4. The `Cursor.execute` method is used to execute the constructed SQL query.

### Explanation of the bug:

The bug occurs because when `self.columns` is `None`, the code attempts to call `len(None)`, which raises a `TypeError` since a `NoneType` object has no length. This issue was reported in a GitHub issue where `columns` being `None` caused the failure of a Redshift COPY job.

### Strategy for fixing the bug:

To fix the bug, we need to add a check for `self.columns` being not `None` before trying to calculate the length of the columns in the `copy` function. This change will prevent the `TypeError` when `self.columns` is `None`.

### Corrected version of the function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    
    if self.columns is not None and len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options())
    )
```

In the corrected version:
- We added a check `if self.columns is not None and len(self.columns) > 0:` to ensure that `self.columns` is not `None` before attempting to calculate its length.
- The call to `self.copy_options` was replaced with `self.copy_options()` to execute the `copy_options` function and get its return value.

By making this change, the `copy` function should now handle cases where `self.columns` is `None` without raising a `TypeError`.
