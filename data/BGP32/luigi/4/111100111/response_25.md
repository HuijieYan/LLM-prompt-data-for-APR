Based on the GitHub issue, the bug seems to be caused by checking the length of `self.columns` without verifying if it's `None` or not. Let's modify the conditions in the `copy` function to handle this scenario correctly.

Here's the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    
    if self.columns is not None and len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

This modification ensures that the length of `self.columns` is checked only if it's not `None`, which should prevent the `TypeError` when `columns` is `None`.

Now, the corrected function will handle the case when `columns` is `None` as expected. This change should resolve the issue described in the GitHub report and pass the failing test case.
