## Analysis
1. The provided buggy function is `copy` within the `S3CopyToTable` class from the `luigi.contrib.redshift` module. 
2. The function currently attempts to construct a SQL query for copying data from S3 to Redshift. 
3. The bug seems to be related to the handling of the `columns` attribute. Specifically, when `self.columns` is `None`, the buggy code tries to check the `len` of `None`, resulting in a `TypeError`.
4. The failing test `test_s3_copy_with_nonetype_columns` aims to test the behavior of `copy` when `self.columns` is `None`, which is currently leading to a failure due to the mentioned bug.
5. To fix the bug, we need to modify the code to handle the case where `self.columns` is `None` before attempting to get the length of `self.columns`.

## Bug Cause
The bug occurs because the code does not check if `self.columns` is `None` before trying to access its length (`len(self.columns)`). When `self.columns` is `None`, it results in a `TypeError: object of type 'NoneType' has no len()`.

## Proposed Fix
To fix the bug, we need to modify the condition that constructs the `colnames` variable to handle the case where `self.columns` is `None`. We can use a conditional check to ensure that when `self.columns` is `None`, we set `colnames` to an empty string.

## Corrected Version
```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns is not None:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options())
    )
```

In this corrected version, we check if `self.columns` is not `None` before attempting to construct the `colnames` variable. This modification ensures that the code won't try to access the length of `None`, fixing the bug identified in the failing test.
