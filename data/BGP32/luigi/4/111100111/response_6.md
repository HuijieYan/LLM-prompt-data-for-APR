## Analysis
The bug in the `S3CopyToTable.copy` function seems to be related to the handling of `self.columns`. The bug arises when `self.columns` is set to `None`, leading to an error when trying to check the length of `None`.

### Error Location
The error can be identified in the following section of the buggy function:
```python
colnames = ''
if len(self.columns) > 0:
    colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
    colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)
```

### Cause of the Bug
The bug occurs because the code tries to check the length of `self.columns` without verifying if `self.columns` is `None`. This leads to a `TypeError` when `self.columns` is `None` while trying to determine the length.

### Suggested Fix Strategy
To fix this bug, the code should first check if `self.columns` is not `None` before proceeding to check its length. By implementing proper checks, we can avoid the `TypeError` when `self.columns` is `None`.

## Corrected Version
Below is the corrected version of the `S3CopyToTable.copy` function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options())
    )
```

In the corrected version, the function now first checks if `self.columns` is not `None` before attempting to determine its length. This fix should address the issue and pass the failing test case provided.
