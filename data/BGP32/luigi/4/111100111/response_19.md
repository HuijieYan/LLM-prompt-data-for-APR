## Analysis:
- The buggy function `copy` in the `S3CopyToTable` class is supposed to define copying from S3 into Redshift. It constructs an SQL query using values from the class attributes and executes it on the provided cursor. 
- The bug seems to be related to how the `colnames` variable is created based on the `self.columns`. The issue arises when `self.columns` is `None`.
- The failing test `test_s3_copy_with_nonetype_columns` tests the scenario where `columns` are `None`, causing the bug to manifest. The expected SQL query does not consider the case when `columns` are `None`.
- The GitHub issue mentions that when `columns` are `None`, the buggy line causes a `TypeError`.
- The suggested solution in the GitHub issue proposes to update the condition that checks for the existence and length of `self.columns` to avoid the `TypeError`.

## Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Update the condition that constructs the `colnames` variable to handle the scenario when `self.columns` is `None`.
2. Modify the condition to check if `self.columns` is not `None` before attempting to construct `colnames`.

## Corrected Version:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns is not None:
        if len(self.columns) > 0:
            colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
            colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options())
    )
```

This corrected version of the `copy` function includes the updated condition to handle the scenario when `self.columns` is `None`. It now checks if `self.columns` is not `None` before attempting to construct the `colnames` variable. This change should address the issue related to the `TypeError` when `columns` are `None`.
