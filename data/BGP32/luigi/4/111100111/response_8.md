## Analysis
1. The buggy function `copy` in the `S3CopyToTable` class is failing to execute properly when the `columns` attribute is set to `None`.
2. The bug arises from the attempt to calculate the length of `self.columns` without checking if it is `None`.
3. The failing test `test_s3_copy_with_nonetype_columns` confirms the issue when trying to call the `copy` method with `columns=None`.
4. To resolve the bug, we need to modify the check for the length of `self.columns` to ensure it is not `None` before trying to get its length.

## Bug Fix Strategy
1. Update the condition checking the length of `self.columns` to handle the case where it is `None`.
2. If `self.columns` is not `None`, proceed to calculate the length and construct the `colnames` string accordingly.
3. By correcting this condition, the function should be able to handle cases where `columns` is `None`.

## Corrected Version

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns is not None and len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

By updating the condition to check if `self.columns` is not `None`, we avoid the `TypeError` that occurs when trying to get the length of `None`. This corrected version should pass the failing test and address the issue mentioned in the GitHub bug report.
