Based on the provided information, the issue seems to be related to the `copy` function in the `S3CopyToTable` class where it fails when `self.columns` is `None`. The root cause is that the code does not handle the case when `self.columns` is `None` correctly, causing the `TypeError`.

To fix this bug, we should adjust the `copy` function to check if `self.columns` is not `None` before trying to access its length. If `self.columns` is `None`, we can set `colnames` to an empty string directly.

Here is the corrected version of the `copy` function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.
    
    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns is not None:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options())
    )
```

By adding the `if self.columns is not None:` check, we ensure that `colnames` is handled correctly even when `self.columns` is `None`. This change should resolve the `TypeError` issue when running the test case provided in the GitHub issue.
