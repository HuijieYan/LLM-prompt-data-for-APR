## Analysis
1. The buggy function `copy` in the `S3CopyToTable` class from `luigi/contrib/redshift.py` is responsible for copying data from S3 into Redshift. The issue is related to passing `None` as the `columns` attribute in the task, which results in a `TypeError` due to trying to find the length of a `NoneType`.
2. The cause of the bug is the lack of handling the case where `self.columns` is `None` before trying to get its length in the original buggy function.
3. The failing test `test_s3_copy_with_nonetype_columns` provides an input task with `columns=None` and expects the SQL query to have an empty `colnames` section. However, the current buggy function doesn't handle the case of `columns` being `None`.
4. To fix the bug, we need to check if `self.columns` is not `None` before calculating the `colnames` variable. If `self.columns` is not `None`, then we proceed with creating the `colnames` string. Otherwise, we set `colnames` as an empty string.
5. I will provide a corrected version of the `copy` function below:

## Corrected Version
```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    
    if self.columns is not None:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)
    else:
        colnames = ''  # Set colnames as an empty string if columns is None
    
    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

By adding the check `if self.columns is not None`, we ensure that we only attempt to create the `colnames` string if `self.columns` is not `None`. This correction will handle the case where `columns` is `None`, as described in the failing test scenario, and fix the bug reported in the GitHub issue.
