## Analysis:
1. The `copy` function within the `S3CopyToTable` class is supposed to define copying data from S3 into Redshift. 
2. The function attempts to execute a SQL `COPY` command using the provided parameters.
3. The bug occurs when trying to evaluate the length of `self.columns` without checking if it is `None`. This causes a `TypeError` when `self.columns` is `None`.
4. The failing test case aims to test the scenario where `columns=None` is passed to the task, leading to the incorrect behavior.
5. The suggested solution in the GitHub issue proposes adding an additional check to prevent the `TypeError` that occurs when `self.columns` is `None`.

## Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to modify the condition checking the length of `self.columns` to include a check for `None` before attempting to get the length. This modification will prevent the `TypeError` from occurring when `self.columns` is `None`.

## Corrected Version:
```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns is not None and len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options())
    )
```

In the corrected version:
- We added a check `if self.columns is not None and len(self.columns) > 0:` to handle the scenario where `self.columns` is `None`.
- We also corrected the call to `self.copy_options()` inside the formatting string.

This corrected version should now pass the failing test case and prevent the `TypeError` when `columns=None` is provided.
