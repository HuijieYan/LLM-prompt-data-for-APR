### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `copy` in the `S3CopyToTable` class is responsible for executing a `COPY` query from S3 into Redshift.
2. The issue arises when `self.columns` is `None`, leading to a `TypeError` when trying to check the length of `None`.
3. The error is caused by the condition `if len(self.columns) > 0` assuming `self.columns` is always a valid list, but it can be `None`.
4. To fix the bug, the condition should be updated to `if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0` to handle the case of `self.columns` being `None`.

### Bug Fix:
```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:  # Check if self.columns is not None before getting its length
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options())
    )
```

By updating the condition to check if `self.columns` exists and then checking its length, we prevent the `TypeError` when `self.columns` is `None`. This change aligns with the suggested solution in the GitHub issue.
