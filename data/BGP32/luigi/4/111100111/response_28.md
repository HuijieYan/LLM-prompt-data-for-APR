## Analysis:
1. The buggy function `copy` in the `S3CopyToTable` class is responsible for copying data from S3 to Redshift.
2. The bug occurs when the `columns` attribute is set to `None`, causing an error when trying to calculate the length of `self.columns`.
3. The failing test case `test_s3_copy_with_nonetype_columns` creates a `DummyS3CopyToTableKey` task with `columns=None` and expects an empty string for `colnames` in the `copy` function's SQL query.
4. The GitHub issue highlights the exact cause: attempting to obtain the length of `None`, proposing a fix to check `self.columns` for existence before checking its length.

## Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to modify the code to check if `self.columns` is not `None` before attempting to determine its length.

## Corrected Version of the Code:
```python
class S3CopyToTable(rdbms.CopyToTable, _CredentialsMixin):
    
    def copy_options(self):
        # Please ignore the body of this function
    
    def copy(self, cursor, f):
        """
        Defines copying from s3 into redshift.
    
        If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
        """
        logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
        colnames = ''
        if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:
            colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
            colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)
    
        cursor.execute("""
         COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
         CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
         {options}
         ;""".format(
            table=self.table,
            colnames=colnames,
            source=f,
            creds=self._credentials(),
            options=self.copy_options())
        )
```

By adding the check `if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0`, we ensure that the code only calculates the length of `self.columns` if it is not `None`. This will prevent the `TypeError` that occurs when `columns` is `None`.
