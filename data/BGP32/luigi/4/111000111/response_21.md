### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `copy` is supposed to define the copying process from an S3 source into Redshift. It constructs a SQL query using attributes like `table`, `columns`, `source`, and `copy_options`.
2. The bug arises from the way the `colnames` variable is determined. If `self.columns` is `None`, attempting to get its length will raise a `TypeError`.
3. The issue on GitHub highlights that the bug occurs when `columns = None`, preventing table creation. The fix proposed in the issue is to check if `self.columns` is not `None` before getting its length.
4. To fix the bug, we need to modify the condition for determining `colnames` to handle the case when `self.columns` is `None`.

### Suggested Fix:
Update the logic for determining `colnames` to handle the case when `self.columns` is `None`.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

This corrected version includes a check `if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0` before constructing `colnames` to avoid the `TypeError` when `self.columns` is `None`.
