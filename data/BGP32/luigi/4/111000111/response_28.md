### Analysis
The buggy function `copy` in the `S3CopyToTable` class is failing due to a TypeError when `self.columns` is set to `None` because it is trying to check the length of `self.columns` directly using `len()` without handling the case where `self.columns` might be None.

### Bugs:
1. The buggy function does not handle the case where `self.columns` is `None`, leading to a TypeError when trying to find the length of `None`.
2. The `self.copy_options` is not being called like a function, causing possible issues.

### Bug Cause:
The bug arises because the buggy function assumes `self.columns` will always have a value, but in cases where it is None, a TypeError occurs. Additionally, the issue in the GitHub report suggests that explicitly checking for `None` before calculating the length of `self.columns` would be a suitable fix.

### Suggested Fix:
1. Check if `self.columns` is not None before performing any operations.
2. Ensure that `self.copy_options` is called like a function instead of just referencing it.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options())
    )
```

By checking for `self.columns` before accessing its length and calling `self.copy_options` as a function, the corrected version should resolve the issue reported in the GitHub thread and handle cases where `self.columns` may be None.
