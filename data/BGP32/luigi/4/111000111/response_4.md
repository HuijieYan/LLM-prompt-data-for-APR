### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `copy` is part of the `S3CopyToTable` class in the `luigi/contrib/redshift.py` file.
2. The function is responsible for executing a Redshift COPY command to load data from S3 into Redshift.
3. The bug occurs when `self.columns` is empty (None), causing an attempt to access its length resulting in a TypeError.
4. The GitHub issue indicates that the bug arises when `self.columns` is None, and proposes a solution to check for None explicitly before accessing the length.

### Bug cause:
The bug in the `copy` function occurs due to improper handling of the `self.columns` attribute when it is empty (None). When `self.columns` is None, attempting to access its length using `len(self.columns)` results in a TypeError.

### Bug fix strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to check if `self.columns` is not None before attempting to access its length. By explicitly checking for None, we can avoid the TypeError.

### Corrected version of the function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:  # Check if self.columns is not None before accessing length
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options())
    )
```

### Changes made:
1. Added a check `if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:` to verify that `self.columns` is not None before trying to access its length.
2. Appropriately called `self.copy_options()` function to retrieve the copy options.

By making these changes, the bug related to empty `self.columns` causing a TypeError should be fixed, resolving the issue highlighted in the GitHub problem statement.
