### Analysis
1. The buggy function `copy` is responsible for copying data from an S3 source to a Redshift table. It constructs an SQL query to perform the copy operation.
2. The bug occurs when the `self.columns` attribute is not provided (set to None), resulting in a TypeError due to attempting to get the length of a NoneType object.
3. The bug is caused by not checking if `self.columns` is None before trying to access its length. This issue was identified in a GitHub bug report related to the same problem.
4. To fix the bug, we need to check if `self.columns` is not None before constructing the `colnames` string.
5. The corrected version of the function will include a check for `self.columns` being not None before attempting to get its length.

### Bug Fix Strategy
- Include a check for `self.columns` being not None before constructing the `colnames` string.
- Update the line `if len(self.columns) > 0:` to `if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:`.

### Corrected Version
```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options())
    )
```

In the corrected version, we check if `self.columns` is not None before constructing the `colnames` string to avoid the TypeError. The `copy_options` function is also called correctly within the SQL query construction.
