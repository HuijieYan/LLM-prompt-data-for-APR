### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `copy` within the `S3CopyToTable` class is responsible for copying data from S3 to Redshift. 
2. The bug occurs when the `copy` function tries to construct the `COPY` query from the provided attributes, specifically `self.columns`.
3. The cause of the bug is that the function does not handle the case where `self.columns` is `None`, which leads to the error when trying to get the length of `None`.
4. To fix the bug, we need to check if `self.columns` is not None before attempting to construct `colnames` from it.

### Bug Fix:
```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:  # Fixing the bug here
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

By adding the check `if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0`, we ensure that `colnames` is only constructed if `self.columns` is not None and has a length greater than zero. This prevents the `TypeError` that occurs when `self.columns` is `None`.
