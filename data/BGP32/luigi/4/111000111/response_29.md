## Analysis
1. The buggy function `copy` is responsible for executing a SQL COPY command to copy data from an S3 source to a Redshift table.
2. The buggy function uses the `self.columns` attribute to determine if column names should be included in the COPY command.
3. In the buggy function, the `colnames` variable is being set to an empty string if `self.columns` has a length greater than 0. This logic is causing an issue when `self.columns` is None.
4. The GitHub issue highlights that when `self.columns` is None (to prohibit table creation), the function fails due to a `TypeError`.
5. The suggested solution in the GitHub issue is to change the condition to `if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0` to handle the case when `self.columns` is None.

## Bug Fix Strategy
1. Update the conditional check for `self.columns` to also check if it's not None before checking its length.
2. Handle the case when `self.columns` is None separately to prevent the `TypeError`.
3. Ensure that the `colnames` variable is appropriately set based on the presence and content of `self.columns`.

## Bug Fixed Version
```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns is not None and len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options())
    )
```

In the corrected version, the conditional check for `self.columns` has been updated to include a check for `self.columns is not None`. This change ensures that the function can handle the case when `self.columns` is None without causing a `TypeError`. Additionally, the `copy_options` function is correctly called with `()`. This should address the issue reported in the GitHub bug.
