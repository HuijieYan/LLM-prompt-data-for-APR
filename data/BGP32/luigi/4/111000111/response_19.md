## Analysis:
The buggy function `copy` in the `S3CopyToTable` class is failing due to not handling the case where `self.columns` is `None`. This causes a `TypeError` when trying to get the length of `self.columns`. The issue reported on GitHub indicates that the problem arises when columns are not provided, leading to the failure during the Redshift COPY operation.

## Bug Explanation:
The bug occurs because the buggy function `copy` does not check if `self.columns` is `None` before trying to get its length. When `self.columns` is `None`, the code fails to concatenate column names, leading to the error. The fix suggested in the GitHub issue proposes checking `if self.columns` before checking its length to avoid this error.

## Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to modify the logic in the `copy` function of the `S3CopyToTable` class. We should first check if `self.columns` is not `None` before attempting to concatenate the column names. This way, we can handle the case where no columns are provided and avoid the `TypeError`.

## Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:  # Check if columns are not None before proceeding
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

By adding the check `if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0`, we ensure that the code only tries to concatenate column names when `self.columns` is not `None`. This correction addresses the bug reported in the GitHub issue and prevents the `TypeError` when no columns are provided.
