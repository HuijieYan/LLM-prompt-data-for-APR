### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `copy` in the `S3CopyToTable` class is responsible for inserting a data set from an S3 source into Redshift.
2. The bug occurs when the `self.columns` attribute is not provided, resulting in an empty list causing the `len` function to raise a `TypeError`.
3. The bug is identified in the conditional check for the length of `self.columns`.
4. To fix the bug, we need to modify the conditional check to ensure that `self.columns` is not `None` before checking its length. This will prevent the `TypeError` when `self.columns` is not provided.

### Bug Fix:
```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns is not None and len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

By updating the conditional check in the `copy` function to `if self.columns is not None and len(self.columns) > 0:`, we ensure that the `len` function is only called when `self.columns` is not `None`, resolving the issue where the failure occurred due to `self.columns` being `None`.
