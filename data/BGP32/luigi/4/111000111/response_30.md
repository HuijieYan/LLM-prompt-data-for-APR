The bug in the provided `copy` function is due to the condition `if len(self.columns) > 0` causing an error when `self.columns` is `None`. This issue is related to a GitHub problem where Redshift COPY jobs fail in luigi 2.7.1 if columns are not provided.

To fix the bug, we should modify the condition to check if `self.columns` is not `None` before checking its length. If `self.columns` is `None`, it should default to an empty list to avoid the error.

Here is the corrected version of the `copy` function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)

    colnames = ''
    if self.columns is not None:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options())
    )
```

With this fix, the `copy` function will first check if `self.columns` is not `None` before attempting to access its length, preventing the `TypeError` from occurring.
