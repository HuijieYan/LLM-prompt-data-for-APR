### Analysis:
1. **Buggy Function Relationship**:
   - The buggy function `copy` is part of the class `S3CopyToTable`, which inherits from `rdbms.CopyToTable` and `_CredentialsMixin`.
   - It calls the `copy_options` function from the same class.
   
2. **Error Location**:
   - The issue arises when trying to get the length of `self.columns` without checking if `self.columns` is `None`.

3. **Cause of the Bug**:
   - The bug is caused by directly checking the length of `self.columns` without verifying if `self.columns` is `None` or not. When `self.columns` is `None`, trying to access its length raises a `TypeError`.
   - The GitHub issue indicates that running Redshift COPY jobs with `columns=None` to prevent table creation fails in Luigi 2.7.1 due to this issue.
   
4. **Strategy for Fixing the Bug**:
   - Update the check for `self.columns` to ensure it is not `None` before proceeding to get its length.
   - If `self.columns` is not `None`, then check its length and proceed accordingly.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns is not None and len(self.columns) > 0:  # Check if self.columns is not None before getting its length
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options())
    )
``` 

In the corrected version, the check `if self.columns is not None and len(self.columns) > 0` ensures that the length of `self.columns` is only accessed if `self.columns` is not `None`. This modification addresses the issue reported on GitHub and prevents the `TypeError` when `columns` is `None`.
