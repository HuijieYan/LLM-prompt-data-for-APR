## Analysis
The bug occurs in the `copy` function of the `S3CopyToTable` class. The problematic line is:
```python
if len(self.columns) > 0:
```
This line assumes that `self.columns` is always a list, which leads to an error when `self.columns` is `None`.

The issue reported on GitHub indicates that the bug causes a failure in Redshift COPY jobs when `columns` are not provided, leading to a `TypeError`.

## Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that `self.columns` is not `None` before trying to access its length. By updating the conditional statement to explicitly check if `self.columns` exists and has a non-zero length, we can prevent the `TypeError`.

## Corrected Version
```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

By updating the `if` condition to check if `self.columns` exists (`self.columns is not None`) before checking its length, we avoid the `TypeError` when `columns` are not provided. This fix should address the issue reported on GitHub and prevent the failure in Redshift COPY jobs.
