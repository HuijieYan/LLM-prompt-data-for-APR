### Analysis
The buggy function `copy` in the `S3CopyToTable` class is supposed to insert data into Redshift from an S3 source. The bug seems to be related to the `colnames` variable being incorrectly set to an empty string when `self.columns` is `None`, which causes an issue during the `COPY` query execution, especially if columns are not provided. The GitHub issue points out that the bug occurs when `columns` are `None`, leading to a `TypeError` due to trying to find the length of `None`.

### Potential Error Locations
1. Setting `colnames` variable when `self.columns` is `None`.
2. Incorrect handling of `self.columns` during the query construction.
3. Issue with the `copy_options` method not being called properly.

### Cause of the Bug
The bug occurs because the `copy` function wrongly assumes that `self.columns` will always have a value, leading to the use of `None` as an empty string. This mistake triggers an error when constructing the `COPY` query if `columns` are not provided, as `None` does not have a length. The GitHub issue provides a clue that addressing the condition check for `self.columns` being `None` before accessing its length might solve the bug.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug
To fix the bug, we should add a condition to check if `self.columns` is not `None` before constructing the `colnames` variable. This will ensure that the `copy` function can handle cases where `columns` are not provided properly.

### Corrected Version of the Function
```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options())
    )
```

#### Changes Made
1. Added a check `if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0` before constructing `colnames`.
2. Corrected the invocation of `self.copy_options` method by adding `()` at the end.

By applying these changes, the bug related to `self.columns` being `None` is resolved, and the function should now handle cases where columns are not provided properly.
