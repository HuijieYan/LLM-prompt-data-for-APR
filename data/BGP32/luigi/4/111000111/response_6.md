## Analysis:
1. The buggy function `copy` in the `S3CopyToTable` class is supposed to copy data from S3 to Redshift using the provided parameters. The issue arises when `self.columns` is not provided, leading to a `TypeError`.
2. The buggy function incorrectly assumes that `self.columns` will always be provided, leading to the error.
3. The bug causes a `TypeError` because the length of `self.columns` is checked without verifying if it exists or not. If `self.columns` is not provided, it will be `None`, which cannot be used with `len()`.
4. To fix the bug, we need to check whether `self.columns` exists and then calculate its length to prevent the `TypeError`.

## Strategy for fixing the bug:
Modify the condition to check if `self.columns` exists and then verify its length before proceeding with constructing the query.

## Corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
``` 

By making the above change, the function will now correctly handle cases where `self.columns` is not provided, preventing the `TypeError` and addressing the issue reported on GitHub.
