### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `copy` in the class `S3CopyToTable` is responsible for defining the copying process from S3 into Redshift. It constructs a SQL query for copying data using the provided parameters.
2. The buggy function accesses `self.columns` to construct the `colnames` variable, assuming it is a list. If `self.columns` is set to `None`, it will cause an error when trying to check its length.
3. The GitHub issue indicates that the bug occurs when `columns` are set to `None`, leading to a `TypeError` due to checking the length of `NoneType`.
4. To fix the bug, we should check if `self.columns` is not `None` before accessing its length in the `copy` function.

### Suggestions for Fixing the Bug:
- Update the `if` condition to check if `self.columns` is not `None` before proceeding to check its length.

### Corrected Version of the Function:

```python
    def copy(self, cursor, f):
        """
        Defines copying from S3 into Redshift.
        
        If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
        """
        logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
        colnames = ''
        if self.columns is not None and len(self.columns) > 0:
            colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
            colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

        cursor.execute("""
         COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
         CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
         {options}
         ;""".format(
            table=self.table,
            colnames=colnames,
            source=f,
            creds=self._credentials(),
            options=self.copy_options())
        )
```

In the corrected version, the `if` condition now explicitly checks if `self.columns` is not `None` before attempting to access its length. This modification should address the issue reported on GitHub.
