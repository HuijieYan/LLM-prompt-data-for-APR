### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `copy` in the `S3CopyToTable` class is responsible for copying data from S3 into Redshift. It constructs an SQL query using the provided parameters and attempts to execute it.
2. The bug occurs when `self.columns` is not provided (i.e., set to `None`). In such cases, the function tries to calculate the length of `self.columns`, leading to a `TypeError`.
3. The GitHub issue suggests that the bug is due to the incorrect check for the existence of `self.columns`. The fix proposed in the issue is to check if `self.columns` exists before trying to calculate its length.
4. To fix the bug, we need to update the check for `self.columns` in the `copy` function.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. We will modify the check for `self.columns` to prevent trying to calculate its length when it is `None`. Instead, we will check if `self.columns` is not `None` and has a length greater than 0.

### Corrected Version:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options())
    )
```

In the corrected version:
- We added a check `if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0` to ensure that `self.columns` is not `None` before attempting to calculate its length.
- We also corrected the call to `self.copy_options()` by adding parentheses to invoke the function.
