## Analysis
1. The buggy function `copy` is responsible for copying data from S3 into Redshift. The issue seems to arise when `self.columns` is not provided, causing a `TypeError`.
2. The bug is caused by accessing `len(self.columns)` without checking if `self.columns` is None.
3. Due to the lack of a check for `self.columns` being None, when it is not provided, the buggy function attempts to call `len` on a NoneType object, leading to the TypeError mentioned in the GitHub issue.
4. To fix the bug, we need to amend the condition where we check the length of `self.columns` by first checking if `self.columns` exists and is not None.
5. We should update the condition to `if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:` to prevent accessing the length of NoneType objects.

## Corrected Version
```python
# The corrected version of the buggy function
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:  # Fix: Added a check for self.columns
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

By incorporating the suggested fix, the corrected version of the function will prevent the TypeError when `self.columns` is not provided, resolving the issue reported on GitHub.
