## Analysis
The buggy function `copy` in the `S3CopyToTable` class is attempting to copy data from an S3 bucket into a Redshift table. The bug occurs when there are no columns provided (`self.columns = None`), resulting in a `TypeError`. The issue reported on GitHub suggests that the bug can be fixed by checking if `self.columns` is not None before checking its length.

## Bug Explanation
The bug occurs because the buggy function assumes that `self.columns` will always have a value and attempts to get the length of `self.columns` directly without checking if it is None. This leads to a `TypeError` when `self.columns` is None, as in the case reported in the GitHub issue.

## Fix Strategy
To fix this bug, we should add a check to ensure that `self.columns` is not None before attempting to get its length. This will prevent the `TypeError` when `self.columns` is not provided.

## Corrected Version
```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options())
    )
```

In the corrected version, we added a check `if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0` to ensure that `self.columns` is not None before attempting to get its length. This will prevent the `TypeError` and resolve the issue reported on GitHub.
