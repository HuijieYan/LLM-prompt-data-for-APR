Based on the GitHub issue provided, the bug occurs when `self.columns` is None and an attempt is made to check its length causing a `TypeError`. The suggested solution is to modify the condition to `if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:` to handle the case when `self.columns` is None properly.

To fix the bug, the `copy` function needs to be updated as follows:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

This modification ensures that `self.columns` is checked for None before accessing its length to prevent the `TypeError`. Now the function will handle the case when `self.columns` is None properly, as suggested in the GitHub issue.
