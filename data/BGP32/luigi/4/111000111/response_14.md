The bug in the `copy` function of the `S3CopyToTable` class is related to the handling of the `self.columns` attribute when it is set to `None`. The issue is caused by not checking if `self.columns` is `None` before trying to determine its length, which results in a `TypeError` when `self.columns` is `None`.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the condition that checks the length of `self.columns` to also include a check for `None`. If `self.columns` is `None` or empty, we should skip constructing the `colnames` string to prevent the error.

Here is the corrected version of the `copy` function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.
    
    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options())
    )
```

In this corrected version, we added a check `if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0` before constructing the `colnames` string. This ensures that the code does not try to manipulate `self.columns` if it is `None`.

By applying this fix, the error mentioned in the GitHub issue titled "Redshift COPY fails in luigi 2.7.1 when columns are not provided" will be resolved.
