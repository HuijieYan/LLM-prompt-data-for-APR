The bug in the `copy` function is due to the incorrect usage of the `copy_options` method. The function is not being called correctly, resulting in `options` being set to the function object itself, instead of the return value of the function.

To fix this bug, the `copy_options` method needs to be called as a function by adding `()` at the end.

Here is the corrected version of the `copy` function:

```python
    def copy(self, cursor, f):
        """
        Defines copying from s3 into redshift.
    
        If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
        """
        logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
        colnames = ''
        if len(self.columns) > 0:
            colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
            colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)
    
        cursor.execute("""
         COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
         CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
         {options}
         ;""".format(
            table=self.table,
            colnames=colnames,
            source=f,
            creds=self._credentials(),
            options=self.copy_options())
        )
```

By adding `()` to `self.copy_options`, we are now correctly calling the method and setting `options` to the return value of the method, as expected. This change should fix the bug and ensure that the function behaves as intended during the failing test case.
