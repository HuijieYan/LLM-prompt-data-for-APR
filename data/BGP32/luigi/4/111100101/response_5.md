### Bug Explanation
The bug in the `copy` function is that the `copy_options` attribute is not being properly called. The `copy_options` attribute is a method that should be called like a function, but instead it is being treated as an attribute. This results in the `options=self.copy_options` line not actually executing the `copy_options` method.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to call the `copy_options` method within the `copy` function. This can be done by adding parentheses `()` after `self.copy_options` to correctly call the method.

### Corrected Version of the `copy` function
```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options())
    )
```

By adding the parentheses `()` after `self.copy_options`, we are correctly calling the `copy_options` method within the `copy` function, which fixes the bug in the original code.
