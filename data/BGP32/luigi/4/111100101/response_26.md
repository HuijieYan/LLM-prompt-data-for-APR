### Analysis
The buggy function `copy` in the `S3CopyToTable` class is failing to properly format the `COPY` command to copy data from s3 to Redshift. The issue seems to be with the `options` parameter in the `cursor.execute` statement. The `self.copy_options` function that is supposed to generate the options is not being called correctly.

### Bug Explanation
The bug occurs because `self.copy_options` is not being called as a function but simply provided as an attribute, causing `options` in the `cursor.execute` statement to be a reference to the function `copy_options` itself rather than the result of calling the function.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that `self.copy_options()` is called as a function to get the correct options string for the `COPY` statement.

### Corrected Code
```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
  
    if len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options())
    )
```

By making the change to call `self.copy_options()` to retrieve the correct options string, the bug should be fixed and the function should now properly execute the `COPY` command in Redshift.
