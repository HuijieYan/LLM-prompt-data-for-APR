### Analysis
1. The buggy function `copy` in the `S3CopyToTable` class is responsible for executing a `COPY` command to load data from S3 into Redshift.
2. The bug seems to be in how the `copy` function is constructing the SQL query string for the `COPY` command.
3. The issue seems to be with passing the `copy_options` function as an argument to the `format` method, which should actually call `copy_options()` to get the result.
4. The strategy for fixing the bug would be to call `self.copy_options()` in the `format` method to include the result of the `copy_options` function in the SQL query string.
5. The corrected version of the function is provided below.

### Corrected Version
```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options())
    )
```

By calling `self.copy_options()` instead of `self.copy_options`, the correct value returned by the `copy_options` function is included in the SQL query string. This corrected version should pass the failing test case provided.
