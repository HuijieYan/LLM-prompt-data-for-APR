The bug in the provided code is due to the fact that the `copy_options` function is not being called correctly in the `S3CopyToTable.copy` function. In the `copy` function, `self.copy_options` is being treated as a method instead of a function. This is causing the `options` parameter in the SQL query to be assigned the function object itself, rather than its return value.

To fix this bug, we need to call the `copy_options` function in the `COPY` SQL query in the `S3CopyToTable.copy` function.

Here is the corrected version of the `copy` function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    options = self.copy_options()  # Call the function here to get the options

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=options)
    )
```

By making this change, the `copy_options` function will be correctly called and the return value will be assigned to the `options` variable in the SQL query. This will ensure that the correct options are passed to the `COPY` command.

The corrected version should now pass the failing test provided.
