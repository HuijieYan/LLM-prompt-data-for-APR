The bug in the provided function `copy()` is in the way the `copy_options` method is called. The function `self.copy_options` should be called as a method by adding parentheses `self.copy_options()` instead of just using `self.copy_options`.

The corrected version of the function would be:

```python
    def copy(self, cursor, f):
        """
        Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

        If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
        """
        logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
        colnames = ''
        if len(self.columns) > 0:
            colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
            colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

        cursor.execute("""
         COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
         CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
         {options}
         ;""".format(
            table=self.table,
            colnames=colnames,
            source=f,
            creds=self._credentials(),
            options=self.copy_options())
        )
```

With this change, the `copy_options` method is properly called and will return the correct options for the `COPY` statement.

This corrected function should now pass the failing test.
