The bug in the provided function is that the `copy_options` function is not being called when formatting the SQL query in the `copy` function. This results in the `copy_options` function not being evaluated correctly and causing the SQL query to be incomplete.

To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the `copy_options` function is actually called in the `copy` function so that its return value is included in the formatted SQL query.

Here is the corrected version of the `copy` function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options())
    )
```

In this corrected version, `self.copy_options()` is being called in the `format` method for the SQL query, ensuring that the return value of `copy_options` is included in the query.

Once this correction is implemented, the `copy` function should now correctly include the options returned by the `copy_options` function in the SQL query, thus passing the failing test case mentioned.
