### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `copy` in the `S3CopyToTable` class is not correctly formatting the `COPY` SQL statement to copy data from S3 into Redshift. The `colnames` variable is not being properly handled when the `self.columns` attribute is empty.
2. The bug is caused by the incorrect formatting of the `colnames` variable in the `COPY` SQL statement, leading to incorrect SQL query execution.
3. The failing test `test_s3_copy_with_nonetype_columns` expects an empty `colnames` value when the `self.columns` attribute is set to None, which is not being handled correctly in the current buggy function.
4. To fix the bug, we need to properly handle the scenario when `self.columns` is None by setting `colnames = ''` to ensure the correct formatting of the `COPY` SQL statement.
5. We should update the `copy` function to handle the case when `self.columns` is None by setting `colnames = ''` and adjusting the `COPY` SQL statement accordingly.

### Corrected Version:
```python
# Fixing the buggy function
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options())
    )
```

The corrected version of the function now correctly handles the scenario when `self.columns` is None by setting `colnames = ''` and formatting the `COPY` SQL statement appropriately. This should pass the failing test case provided.
