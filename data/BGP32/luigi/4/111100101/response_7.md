The bug in the `copy` function is that the `copy_options` function is not being correctly called. In the string formatting of the SQL query, `self.copy_options` should be `self.copy_options()`, as it is a method call. This bug causes the `options` part of the `COPY` command to be empty, which leads to the failing test.

To fix this issue, update the line within the `cursor.execute` method call from:
```python
options=self.copy_options
```
to:
```python
options=self.copy_options()
```

Here is the corrected version of the `copy` function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options())
    )
```

With this correction, the function should now correctly call the `copy_options` method and pass the options to the `COPY` command, allowing the test to pass.
