### Bug explanation
The bug in the `copy` function lies in how the `copy_options` function is called within the `cursor.execute` statement. The current implementation is missing the `()` after `self.copy_options`, which means the function itself is being passed instead of calling the function and passing its result.

### Bug fix strategy
To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the `copy_options` function is called and its result is passed correctly to the `cursor.execute` statement.

### Corrected version of the buggy function
```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options())
    )
```

By adding `()` after `self.copy_options`, we ensure that the function is correctly called and its result is passed as expected. This change should fix the bug and ensure that the test case `test_s3_copy_with_nonetype_columns` passes successfully.
