The bug in the `copy` function is caused by not calling the `copy_options` method correctly. The function `copy_options` should be called as a method by using `self.copy_options()` instead of just `self.copy_options`.

Here is the corrected version of the `copy` function:

```python
    def copy(self, cursor, f):
        """
        Defines copying from s3 into redshift.
    
        If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
        """
        logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
        colnames = ''
        if len(self.columns) > 0:
            colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
            colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)
    
        cursor.execute("""
         COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
         CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
         {options}
         ;""".format(
            table=self.table,
            colnames=colnames,
            source=f,
            creds=self._credentials(),
            options=self.copy_options())
        )
```

By correcting the call to `copy_options` by using `self.copy_options()`, the function will now correctly call the `copy_options` method as intended.

This correction should address the bug and make the function work as expected, passing the failing test case provided.
