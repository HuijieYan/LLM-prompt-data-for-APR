### Bug explanation:

The bug in the `copy` function is caused by passing `self.copy_options` as a method without calling it. In the SQL query string, `options=self.copy_options` should be `options=self.copy_options()`. This causes the `copy_options` function to not execute and the options to be empty, resulting in an incorrect SQL query when executed.

### Bug fix strategy:

To fix the bug, we need to call the `copy_options` method when constructing the SQL query string in the `copy` function.

### Corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options())
    )
```

After making this correction, the `copy` function should now execute the `copy_options` method and construct the SQL query string correctly.
