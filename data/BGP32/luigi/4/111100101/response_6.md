#### Bug Analysis:
The bug in the `copy` function lies in the way `self.copy_options` is being called. In the last line of the function where `self.copy_options` is passed as a parameter to the `format` function, it is not being called as a function which results in `copy_options` being used as a method instead of a string.

#### Bug Explanation:
The bug occurs because `self.copy_options` is a function defined in the class and should be called as `self.copy_options()`. However, in the buggy function, it is being used without the parentheses `()` which results in passing the function object itself instead of the return value of the function.

#### Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug in the `copy` function, `self.copy_options()` should be correctly called with parentheses to execute the function and obtain its return value, which is expected to be a string. By invoking the function with parentheses, the function will return the required string that should be included in the SQL query.

#### Corrected Version of the buggy function:
```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options())
    )
```

By making this change, the `copy` function should now correctly include the return value of `self.copy_options()` in the SQL query when executing the cursor. This corrected version is expected to pass the failing test and produce the expected output values.
