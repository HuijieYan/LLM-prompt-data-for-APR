The bug in the `copy` function is due to the incorrect usage of `self.copy_options`. In the `cursor.execute` method, `self.copy_options` should be called as a function `self.copy_options()` to get the actual copy options for the Redshift `COPY` command.

To fix this bug, we need to call `self.copy_options()` as a function in the `cursor.execute` method.

Here is the corrected version of the `copy` function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options())
    )
```

By calling `self.copy_options()` as a function inside the `cursor.execute` method, the bug should be fixed and the provided test case should pass successfully.
