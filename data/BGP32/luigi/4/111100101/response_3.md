### Analysis
The buggy function `copy` in the `S3CopyToTable` class is not correctly formatting the `COPY` SQL statement. The `copy_options` function is not being called correctly, and the `colnames` variable is not being used properly when constructing the SQL query.

### Bug Explanation
1. The `copy_options` function is never being called in the `copy` function. It should be invoked as a method in order to retrieve the options for the `COPY` statement.
2. The `colnames` variable is being concatenated to form the column names in the `COPY` statement, but it is not being used correctly due to missing parentheses.

### Fix Strategy
To fix the bug:
1. Call the `copy_options` function properly to retrieve the options for the `COPY` statement.
2. Update the `colnames` variable usage in the SQL query to include parentheses for proper formatting.

### Corrected Version
```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)  # Add parentheses for column names

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options())  # Call copy_options function to get options
    )
```

By implementing these changes, the `copy` function should now properly format the `COPY` SQL statement and take into account the column names and additional options. This corrected version should pass the failing test case provided.
