### Analysis
- The `copy()` function is responsible for copying data from S3 into Redshift.
- The bug seems to be related to how the `copy_options` string is being passed in the SQL query.
- The `copy_options` function is not being called correctly in the SQL query construction.
- The function is missing the `()` at the end when calling `self.copy_options`.

### Bug Cause
The bug is caused by not correctly calling `self.copy_options` as a function in the SQL query construction. This results in the `copy_options` function not being executed, and its return value is not appended to the SQL query.

### Strategy for fixing the bug
To fix the bug, we need to call `self.copy_options()` with parentheses to correctly execute the method and get its return value.

### Corrected Version
```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options())
    )
```
