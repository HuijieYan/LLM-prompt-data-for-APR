The bug in the provided code lies in the `copy_options` variable being incorrectly used in the `cursor.execute` statement in the `copy` function of the `S3CopyToTable` class. The `copy_options` function should actually be called to retrieve the copy options string, but instead it is being referenced directly.

To fix the bug:
1. Call the `copy_options` function to retrieve the copy options string before using it in the `cursor.execute` statement.

Here is the corrected version of the `copy` function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    copy_options = self.copy_options()  # Call the copy_options function to retrieve the options
    
    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=copy_options)  # Replace self.copy_options with copy_options
    )
```

By making this change, the `copy` function now correctly retrieves the copy options string by calling the `copy_options` function and uses it in the `cursor.execute` statement.

This corrected version should now pass the failing test by correctly formatting the `COPY` statement with the copy options included.
