### Analysis
The buggy function `copy` in the `S3CopyToTable` class is failing to properly format the `COPY` statement due to not calling the `copy_options` function correctly. This results in the test failing because the expected `COPY` statement does not match the actual statement executed. 

### Bug
The bug lies in the line `options=self.copy_options)` where `self.copy_options()` should be called as a function to retrieve the actual options string, but instead, it is being passed as a reference to the function itself.

### Fix
To fix the bug, we need to call the `copy_options` function by adding parentheses `self.copy_options()` to get the actual options string inside the `COPY` statement.

### Corrected Version
```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options())  # Fixed by adding parentheses to call the function
    )
``` 

This corrected version will properly format the `COPY` statement and pass the failing test case.
