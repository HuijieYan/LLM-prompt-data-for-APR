### Analysis
1. The buggy function `copy` in the `S3CopyToTable` class is trying to execute a `COPY` statement to copy data from an S3 source into a Redshift table. However, there are issues with formatting the SQL query and using the `copy_options` attribute.
2. The `colnames` variable is incorrectly formatted in the SQL query. 
3. The bug causes the SQL query to be formatted incorrectly, leading to a failed test due to incorrect SQL syntax.
4. To fix the bug, we need to properly format the `colnames` variable and correctly call the `copy_options` function.

### Bug Fix Strategy
1. Fix the formatting of the `colnames` variable in the SQL query.
2. Correctly call the `copy_options` function to include the copy options in the SQL query.

### Corrected Version
```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames) if colnames else ''

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options())
    )
``` 

The corrected version includes the modification to properly format the `colnames` variable and properly call the `copy_options` function to include the copy options in the SQL query.
