The bug in the provided function `copy()` is that the `copy_options` function is not being called correctly. The function `copy_options` needs to be called as a method by adding parentheses `()`, like `self.copy_options()`, in order to execute it and obtain the desired options for the `COPY` command.

Here is the corrected version of the `copy()` function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options())
    )
```

By making this change, the `copy_options()` function will be correctly called and its return value will be used in the `cursor.execute` statement, fixing the bug. The corrected function should now pass the failing test case provided.

Please let me know if you need further assistance.
