The bug in the `copy` function lies in the way `self.copy_options` is being referenced without calling it as a function. This leads to `self.copy_options` not being executed and causing the function to fail due to the missing copy options in the SQL query. 

To fix this bug, we need to call `self.copy_options()` instead of `self.copy_options` in the SQL query construction.

Here is the corrected version of the `copy` function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options())  # Fix: Call copy_options as a function
    )
```

With this correction, the `self.copy_options()` function will be executed, and the SQL query will include the copy options. This should make the `copy` function work correctly and pass the failing test.
