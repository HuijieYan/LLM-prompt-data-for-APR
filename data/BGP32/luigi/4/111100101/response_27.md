### Bug Explanation
The bug occurs in the `S3CopyToTable.copy()` function where the `self.copy_options` attribute is not being properly called. Instead of executing the `copy_options()` method to get the actual options, it is trying to use the method itself as a string, leading to an error in the `cursor.execute()` call.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to call the `copy_options()` method to get the actual options string and pass it to the `cursor.execute()` call in the correct format.

### Corrected Version
```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    # Call copy_options to get the actual copy options string
    copy_options_str = self.copy_options()

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=copy_options_str)
    )
```

By making this change, the `copy()` function will now correctly call the `copy_options()` method to get the desired options string before executing the SQL `COPY` statement. This corrected version should now pass the failing test case provided.
