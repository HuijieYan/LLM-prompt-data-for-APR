### Analysis
The buggy function `copy` in the `S3CopyToTable` class is failing to execute the `copy_options` function correctly while constructing the SQL query for the `COPY` operation. This results in the `options` parameter being a reference to the `copy_options` function instead of its return value.

### Bug Explanation
The bug occurs because the `copy_options` function is not being called to get its return value. Instead, it is being referenced directly in the string formatting, resulting in the `options` parameter being set to a reference to the function itself.

### Bug Fix
To fix the bug, we need to call the `copy_options` function to get its return value before inserting it into the SQL query string.

### Corrected Version of the Function
```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    options = self.copy_options()  # Call the copy_options function to get its return value
    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=options)  # Insert the return value of copy_options
    )
```

After applying this fix, the `copy` function will now call the `copy_options` function and use its return value correctly in constructing the SQL query for the `COPY` operation. This corrected version should pass the failing test case.
