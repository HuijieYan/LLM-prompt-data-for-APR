### Explanation of the bug
The bug in the `copy` function lies in the way the `copy_options` method is called within the string formatting of the SQL query. The `copy_options` method should be called as a function `self.copy_options()` but it is being referenced as an attribute `self.copy_options`. This results in passing the method object itself instead of the return value of the method when constructing the SQL query.

### Strategy for fixing the bug
To fix the bug, we need to call the `copy_options` method by appending `()` at the end to execute the method and get its return value to be included in the SQL query.

### Corrected version of the buggy function
```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options())
    )
``` 

After this correction, when the `copy` function is called, the `copy_options` method will be executed, and its return value will be properly included in the SQL query. This should fix the bug and make the function behave as expected in the failing test scenarios.
