### Analysis
The buggy function `copy()` in the `S3CopyToTable` class is failing to properly format the `COPY` SQL statement due to incorrect usage of `format()` method. The `copy_options` should be called as a function `self.copy_options()` instead of being assigned directly.

### Bug Cause
The bug is caused by incorrectly referencing the `copy_options` property in the `COPY` SQL statement. The `copy_options` property is meant to be a method that returns specific copy options, but it is being referenced directly without executing the method.

### Fix
To fix the bug, we need to call the `self.copy_options()` method instead of referencing it directly in the SQL statement.

### Corrected Version
```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    
    colnames = ''
    if len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options())
    )
```

By calling `self.copy_options()` in the `options` part of the `COPY` SQL statement, the copy options will be correctly generated and passed to the `cursor.execute()` method.
