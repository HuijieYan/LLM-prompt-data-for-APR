The bug in the provided `copy` function lies in how `copy_options` is being called. In the buggy code, `self.copy_options` is used without parentheses, which doesn't actually call the `copy_options` function but instead references the function object itself.

To fix this bug, we need to make sure to include parentheses when calling the `copy_options` function to actually execute it and get its return value. This will ensure that the correct options are included in the `COPY` statement.

Here is the corrected version of the `copy` function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options())
    )
```

By making this change and calling `copy_options` with parentheses, the corrected `copy` function will now execute the `copy_options` function and include the correct options in the `COPY` statement. This corrected version should pass the failing test provided.
