The bug in the `copy` function of the `S3CopyToTable` class is due to not calling the `copy_options` method correctly. The `copy_options` method is a function of the same class, but it is being accessed as an attribute without calling it as a method.

To fix this bug, we need to call the `copy_options` method by adding `()` after `self.copy_options` in the `cursor.execute` statement.

Here is the corrected version of the `copy` function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options())  # Fixed bug by calling the copy_options method
    )
```

With this fix, the `copy` function should now correctly call the `copy_options` method and pass the failing test case provided.
