## Bug analysis:

The buggy function `copy` is failing due to a `TypeError: object of type 'NoneType' has no len()`. This error occurs because the function is trying to get the length of `self.columns`, which is `None` in this case (as passed in the `DummyS3CopyToTableKey` initialization). 

## Bug fix strategy:

To fix this bug, we need to handle the case where `self.columns` is `None` before attempting to get its length. We can check if `self.columns` is not `None` before proceeding to construct the `colnames` string.

## The corrected version of the function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns is not None and len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options())
    )
```

By adding the check `if self.columns is not None and len(self.columns) > 0`, we ensure that the function handles the case where `self.columns` is `None` properly. This modification will prevent the `TypeError` from occurring and the function should now work correctly for cases where `self.columns` is `None`.
