## Bug Analysis:
- The buggy function `copy` is trying to check the length of `self.columns`, which is `None` according to the failing test case.
- The error occurs because a `NoneType` object does not have the `len()` function defined, causing a `TypeError`.

## Bug Fix:
To fix the bug, we need to handle the case where `self.columns` is `None` before checking its length.

## Corrected Function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """

    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options())
    )
```

By adding the `if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:` condition, we first check if `self.columns` is not `None` before trying to access its length. This modification ensures that the function will not throw a `TypeError` when `self.columns` is `None`.

With this correction, the function should now handle the case where `self.columns` is `None` appropriately and pass the failing test.
