To fix the bug in the `copy` function, we need to handle the case where `self.columns` is `None` before trying to access its length. The error occurs because we are trying to check the length of `None`, which results in a `TypeError`.

To address this, we can modify the condition to check if `self.columns` is not `None` before proceeding with further operations.

Here is the corrected version of the `copy` function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    if self.columns is not None:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)
    else:
        colnames = ''
    
    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

This version ensures that the `colnames` variable is only populated if `self.columns` is not `None`. This modification should fix the bug and make the function behave as expected in the failing test case.
