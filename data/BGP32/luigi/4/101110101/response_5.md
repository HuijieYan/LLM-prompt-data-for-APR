## Bug analysis:
The bug occurs because the buggy function `copy` attempts to check the length of `self.columns` without handling the case where `self.columns` is `None`. This leads to a `TypeError` when trying to call `len` on a `NoneType`.

## Bug fix strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to handle the case where `self.columns` is `None` before trying to access its length. We can check if `self.columns` is `None` and set the `colnames` variable to an empty string in that case.

## The corrected version of the buggy function:
```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns is not None:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options())
    )
```

By checking if `self.columns` is not `None` before accessing its length, the bug is fixed. The corrected version should now handle the case where `self.columns` is `None` without causing a `TypeError`.
