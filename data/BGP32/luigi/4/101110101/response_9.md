## Bug Explanation
The buggy function `copy` is failing because it is trying to check the length of `self.columns` without first verifying if `self.columns` is `None`. In the failing test case, the `columns` parameter of `DummyS3CopyToTableKey` is passed as `None`, causing the error `TypeError: object of type 'NoneType' has no len()` when trying to check the length of `self.columns`.

## Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to check if `self.columns` is `None` before attempting to get its length. If `self.columns` is `None`, we can assign an empty string to `colnames` directly without further processing.

## The Corrected Version of the Function

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0: # Check if self.columns is not None before checking its length
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

With this correction, the function will first check if `self.columns` is not `None` before attempting to get its length. This will prevent the `TypeError` that was occurring when `self.columns` was `None`. The corrected function should now pass the failing test case and satisfy the expected input/output values.
