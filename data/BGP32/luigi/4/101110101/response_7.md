The bug in the provided function is due to the comparison `if len(self.columns) > 0:` where `self.columns` is `None`. This causes a `TypeError` when trying to get the length of a `NoneType` object.

To fix this bug, we can modify the if condition to check if `self.columns` is not `None` before checking its length.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: luigi/contrib/redshift.py

class S3CopyToTable(rdbms.CopyToTable, _CredentialsMixin):
    
    def copy_options(self):
        # Please ignore the body of this function

    def copy(self, cursor, f):
        """
        Defines copying from s3 into redshift.
    
        If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
        """
        logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
        colnames = ''
        
        if self.columns is not None and len(self.columns) > 0:
            colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
            colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)
    
        cursor.execute("""
         COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
         CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
         {options}
         ;""".format(
            table=self.table,
            colnames=colnames,
            source=f,
            creds=self._credentials(),
            options=self.copy_options)
        )
```

With this fix, the function will check if `self.columns` is not `None` before trying to get its length, avoiding the `TypeError` that occurred in the failing test.

The corrected function should now pass the failing test case with the expected input/output values.
