## Bug Analysis:
The bug occurs in the `copy()` function of `S3CopyToTable` class when checking the length of `self.columns`. The error is due to `self.columns` being `None`, which does not support the `len()` function. This causes a `TypeError` during the comparison `if len(self.columns) > 0`.

## Bug Fix:
To fix the bug, we need to check if `self.columns` is `None` before trying to get its length. If it is `None`, we can set `colnames` directly as an empty string. If it is not `None`, then we proceed to construct the `colnames` string.

Here is the corrected version of the `copy()` function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns is not None:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options())
    )
```

By adding the check `if self.columns is not None:`, we ensure that the code will only attempt to get the length of `self.columns` if it is not `None`.

The corrected function will now handle cases where `self.columns` is `None` without causing a `TypeError`.
