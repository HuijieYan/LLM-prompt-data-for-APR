## Fixing the Bug

### Bug:
The bug in the provided `copy` function is due to the fact that the function does not handle the case where `self.columns` is `None`. When `self.columns` is `None`, trying to use `len(self.columns)` will raise a `TypeError` because `NoneType` objects do not have the `len()` method.

### Strategy for Fixing:
To fix this bug, we need to check if `self.columns` is `None` before attempting to get its length. If `self.columns` is `None`, we can set `colnames` to an empty string directly without trying to join any values.

### Updated/Copied Version of the Function:

```python
    def copy(self, cursor, f):
        """
        Defines copying from s3 into redshift.
    
        If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
        """
        logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
        if self.columns is not None:
            colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
            colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)
        else:
            colnames = ''
    
        cursor.execute("""
         COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
         CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
         {options}
         ;""".format(
            table=self.table,
            colnames=colnames,
            source=f,
            creds=self._credentials(),
            options=self.copy_options)
        )
```

### Updated Function Behavior:
The updated version of the `copy` function checks if `self.columns` is `None` before attempting to get the length. If `self.columns` is `None`, it sets `colnames` to an empty string directly. This modification prevents the `TypeError` that occurred due to trying to get the length of a `NoneType` object.

By making this change, the function is now able to handle the case when `self.columns` is `None` and should pass the failing test case provided.
