## Bug analysis:

The error occurs due to the buggy function `copy` trying to access the `len` attribute of `self.columns` without checking whether `self.columns` is `None` or not. The error message indicates that `self.columns` is `None` which results in a `TypeError` when trying to get the length of a `NoneType` object.

## Bug fixing strategy:

To fix this bug, we need to add a check for `None` before checking the length of `self.columns` in the `copy` function. We can modify the condition to handle the case where `self.columns` is `None`.

## Corrected code:

```python
# The declaration of the class containing the corrected function
class S3CopyToTable(rdbms.CopyToTable, _CredentialsMixin):
    
    def copy_options(self):
        # Please ignore the body of this function

    # The corrected function
    def copy(self, cursor, f):
        """
        Defines copying from s3 into redshift.
    
        If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
        """
        logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
        colnames = ''
        if self.columns is not None and len(self.columns) > 0:
            colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
            colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)
    
        cursor.execute("""
         COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
         CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
         {options}
         ;""".format(
            table=self.table,
            colnames=colnames,
            source=f,
            creds=self._credentials(),
            options=self.copy_options())
        )
```

By adding a check for `self.columns is not None` before checking the length, we ensure that the buggy function won't encounter the `TypeError` when `self.columns` is `None`. This corrected version of the function should now pass the failing test case provided.
