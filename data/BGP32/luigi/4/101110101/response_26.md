## Analysis
The error occurs because the `if` condition `if len(self.columns) > 0:` is trying to find the length of `self.columns` when it is `None`. This results in a `TypeError`.

## Solution
To fix the bug, we need to handle the case when `self.columns` is `None` before checking its length.

## Corrected Version

```python
    def copy(self, cursor, f):
        """
        Defines copying from s3 into redshift.
    
        If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
        """
        logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
        
        colnames = ''
        if self.columns is not None:
            colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
            colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)
    
        cursor.execute("""
         COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
         CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
         {options}
         ;""".format(
            table=self.table,
            colnames=colnames,
            source=f,
            creds=self._credentials(),
            options=self.copy_options())
        )
``` 

By adding `if self.columns is not None:` before trying to get the length of `self.columns`, we ensure that the `TypeError` due to `NoneType` will not occur. This correction will handle the case when `self.columns` is `None` and prevent the error.
