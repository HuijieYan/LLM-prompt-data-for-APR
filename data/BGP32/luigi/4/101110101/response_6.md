The bug in the provided `copy` function is due to the condition `if len(self.columns) > 0` where `self.columns` is set to `None` in the test case. This condition causes a `TypeError` since `NoneType` does not have a `len()` function.

To fix this bug, we can check if `self.columns` is not `None` before trying to get its length.

Here is the corrected version of the `copy` function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
        """
        Defines copying from s3 into redshift.
    
        If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
        """
        logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
        colnames = ''
        
        if self.columns is not None and len(self.columns) > 0:
            colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
            colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)
    
        cursor.execute("""
         COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
         CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
         {options}
         ;""".format(
            table=self.table,
            colnames=colnames,
            source=f,
            creds=self._credentials(),
            options=self.copy_options)
        )
```

This correction ensures that the `len()` function is only called on `self.columns` when it is not `None`, avoiding the `TypeError` that was occurring in the failing test case.

With this correction, the function should now pass the failing test case.
