The bug in the provided function is caused by trying to access the `len()` function on a `NoneType` object (`self.columns`) in the `copy` function. This results in a `TypeError` as `NoneType` objects do not have a length. To fix this bug, we need to handle the case where `self.columns` is `None` before trying to access its length.

Here is the corrected version of the `copy` function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns is not None:  # Check if columns is not None before accessing its length
        if len(self.columns) > 0:
            colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
            colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options())
    )
```

In this corrected version, we first check if `self.columns` is not `None` before trying to access its length. If `self.columns` is not `None`, we proceed with processing the column names as before.

By making this change, the function should now handle the case where `self.columns` is `None` without raising a `TypeError`. It should pass the failing test case provided.

Please replace the buggy function in your code with this corrected version.
