## Bug Analysis:

### Potential Error Locations:
1. The `if len(self.columns) > 0` condition checks if `self.columns` is not `None`, however, in the failing test, `columns` is `None`.
2. The `colnames` variable is being set based on the condition `if len(self.columns) > 0`, but it is not handling the case when `self.columns` is `None`.

### Cause of the Bug:
The bug occurs because the code is trying to call `len()` function on a `NoneType` object (`self.columns`), which leads to a `TypeError`. Since the `columns` parameter is `None`, it should be handled appropriately to prevent this error.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to check if `self.columns` is not `None` before trying to get its length. If it is `None`, we should handle the `colnames` variable appropriately.

### Corrected Code:
```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns is not None:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options())
    )
```

By updating the `copy` function to explicitly check if `self.columns` is `None` before attempting to get its length, we prevent the `TypeError` and ensure that the function works correctly in cases where `columns` is `None`.
