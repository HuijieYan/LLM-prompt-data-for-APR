## Bug Analysis:
The buggy function `copy` in the `S3CopyToTable` class from the `luigi/contrib/redshift.py` file is attempting to check the length of `self.columns` without handling the case where `self.columns` is `None`. This leads to a `TypeError` when trying to execute `len(None)`.

## Bug Fix:
To fix the bug, we need to handle the case where `self.columns` is `None` before attempting to get its length. We can modify the condition to check if `self.columns` is not `None` before proceeding further.

## Corrected Function:
```python
class S3CopyToTable(rdbms.CopyToTable, _CredentialsMixin):
    def copy_options(self):
        # Please ignore the body of this function

    def copy(self, cursor, f):
        """
        Defines copying from s3 into redshift.
    
        If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
        """
        logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
        colnames = ''
        if self.columns is not None:
            colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
            colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)
    
        cursor.execute("""
         COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
         CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
         {options}
         ;""".format(
            table=self.table,
            colnames=colnames,
            source=f,
            creds=self._credentials(),
            options=self.copy_options())
        )
``` 

By adding the `if self.columns is not None:` check before accessing the length of `self.columns`, we prevent the `TypeError` from occurring and address the bug.
