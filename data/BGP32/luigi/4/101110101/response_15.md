## Bug Analysis
In the buggy function `copy(self, cursor, f)`, the bug is caused by the comparison `if len(self.columns) > 0:` where `self.columns` is `None`, resulting in a `TypeError: object of type 'NoneType' has no len()`. The source of the error is that `self.columns` is not properly handled when it is `None`.

## Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to add a null check for `self.columns` before attempting to get its length. We can use `if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:` to ensure that the code doesn't raise an error when `self.columns` is `None`.

## Corrected Version
```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

With this correction, the function will check if `self.columns` is not `None` before attempting to get its length, avoiding the `TypeError` that was occurring.
