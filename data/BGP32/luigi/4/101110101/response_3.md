The issue in the buggy function is that it tries to check the length of `self.columns` without checking if `self.columns` is `None` or not. This leads to a `TypeError` when `self.columns` is `None`.

To fix this bug, we should check if `self.columns` is `None` before trying to access its length. If it's `None`, then `colnames` should remain an empty string.

Here is the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
# The corrected version of the buggy function
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns is not None:  # Check if self.columns is not None
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options())
    )
```

By adding the check `if self.columns is not None:`, we ensure that the code won't try to access the length of `self.columns` when it's `None`. This correction will prevent the `TypeError` that was occurring in the failing test.
