## Bug Analysis:

- The buggy function `copy(self, cursor, f)` is trying to check the length of `self.columns`, but it is not handling the case where `self.columns` is `None`.
- The error message `TypeError: object of type 'NoneType' has no len()` indicates that `self.columns` is `None` and it cannot be used with the `len()` function causing a `TypeError`.

## Bug Fix:

To fix the bug, we need to add a check to handle the case where `self.columns` is `None` before trying to get its length.

## Corrected Function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns is not None:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options())
    )
``` 

In the corrected version of the function, we first check if `self.columns` is not `None` before trying to access its length. This prevents the `TypeError` that was occurring due to trying to get the length of `None`.
