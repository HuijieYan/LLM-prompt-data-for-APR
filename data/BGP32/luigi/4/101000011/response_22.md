## Analysis:
1. The buggy function `copy` is attempting to construct a SQL query using values from the class attributes like `columns`, `table`, and `source`. The issue arises when the `columns` attribute is empty or set to `None`, leading to a `TypeError` when trying to get the length of `None`.
2. The related function `copy_options` within the same class is not directly related to the bug but might be involved in setting up additional copy options for the Redshift `COPY` command.
3. The GitHub issue indicates that the problem is caused by trying to get the length of `None` when `columns` is None, leading to a `TypeError`. The suggested solution in the GitHub issue is to check if `self.columns` is not None before attempting to get its length.
4. To fix the bug, we need to modify the `copy` function to handle the case where `columns` is None.

## Bug Fix Strategy:
- Check if `self.columns` is not None before proceeding to use it in constructing the SQL query.
- Perform a conditional check to handle cases where `self.columns` is None.
- Update the string formatting in the `cursor.execute` statement to correctly handle the case of `colnames` being an empty string when `columns` is None.

## Corrected Version:
```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns is not None and len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options())
    )

```

In the corrected version, we added a check `if self.columns is not None and len(self.columns) > 0` to ensure that only when `self.columns` is not None and has elements, the `colnames` are constructed and used in the SQL query. This change will prevent the `TypeError` when `columns` is None.
