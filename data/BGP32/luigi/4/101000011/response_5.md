## Analysis and Explanation:
The buggy function `copy()` within the `S3CopyToTable` class in the `luigi/contrib/redshift.py` file is failing when `self.columns` is `None`. This issue arises because the buggy implementation does not handle the case when `self.columns` is not provided correctly, leading to a `TypeError`.

According to the GitHub issue mentioned, the bug occurs due to trying to get the length of `self.columns` directly without first checking if it exists. As pointed out in the GitHub discussion, this behavior causes an error when `self.columns` is `None`.

## Bug Fix Strategy:
To resolve this issue, we need to modify the buggy function `copy()` to check if `self.columns` exists before attempting to extract its length. By making this adjustment, we can avoid the `TypeError` that occurs when `self.columns` is `None`.

## Corrected Version:
```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: luigi/contrib/redshift.py

# The corrected buggy function
class S3CopyToTable(rdbms.CopyToTable, _CredentialsMixin):
    def copy_options(self):
        # Please ignore the body of this function

    def copy(self, cursor, f):
        """
        Defines copying from s3 into redshift.
    
        If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
        """
        logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
        colnames = ''
        if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:
            colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
            colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

        cursor.execute("""
         COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
         CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
         {options}
         ;""".format(
            table=self.table,
            colnames=colnames,
            source=f,
            creds=self._credentials(),
            options=self.copy_options())
        )
```

In the corrected version, `if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:` is used to first check if `self.columns` exists before attempting to get its length. This modification ensures that the code does not raise a `TypeError` when `self.columns` is `None`.

By implementing this fix, the buggy function now correctly handles the case when `self.columns` is not provided, addressing the issue reported on GitHub.
