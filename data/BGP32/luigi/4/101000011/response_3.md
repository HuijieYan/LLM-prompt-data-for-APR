## Analysis:
The buggy function `copy` in the `S3CopyToTable` class is failing when `self.columns` is None, resulting in a `TypeError` because the code tries to access the length of `self.columns` without checking if it is None or not. This issue is identified in the GitHub thread related to the failure of Redshift COPY jobs when columns are not provided.

## Error Location:
The error is occurring at the line:
```python
if len(self.columns) > 0:
```
This line assumes `self.columns` is not None before checking its length, leading to the `TypeError` when `self.columns` is actually None.

## Cause of the Bug:
The bug is caused by the assumption that `self.columns` will always have a valid list of columns specified. If `self.columns` is None, the code breaks because `NoneType` does not have a length property.

## Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix this bug, we need to check if `self.columns` is not None before attempting to access its length. By adding a condition to check for None, we can avoid the `TypeError` when `self.columns` is not explicitly provided.

## Corrected Version:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:  # Check if self.columns is not None before accessing its length
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

By adding the condition `if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:` before processing `self.columns`, we ensure that the bug causing the `TypeError` is resolved. This fix addresses the issue reported on GitHub related to Redshift COPY failures when columns are not provided.
