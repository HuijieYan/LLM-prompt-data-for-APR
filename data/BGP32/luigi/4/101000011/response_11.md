## Analysis:
The buggy function `copy` in the `S3CopyToTable` class is causing issues when `self.columns` is not provided, leading to a `TypeError`. This bug is related to a GitHub issue that points out the issue when columns are not provided.

## Identified Error:
The error occurs when trying to access the length of `self.columns` without checking if it is `None`, causing a `TypeError`.

## Bug Cause:
The bug originates from the line `if len(self.columns) > 0:` where `self.columns` might be `None`, resulting in a `TypeError`. This inconsistency leads to the failure of Redshift COPY jobs when columns are not explicitly provided.

## Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to modify the line that checks the length of `self.columns` to ensure that it is not `None` before attempting to get its length. By adding a condition `if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0`, we can prevent the `TypeError` when `self.columns` is `None`.

## Corrected Version:
```python
    def copy(self, cursor, f):
        """
        Defines copying from s3 into redshift.
    
        If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
        """
        logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
        colnames = ''
        if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:
            colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
            colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)
    
        cursor.execute("""
         COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
         CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
         {options}
         ;""".format(
            table=self.table,
            colnames=colnames,
            source=f,
            creds=self._credentials(),
            options=self.copy_options)
        )
```

By making this change, we ensure that the bug identified in the GitHub issue is fixed, and Redshift COPY operations will work properly even when columns are not specified.
