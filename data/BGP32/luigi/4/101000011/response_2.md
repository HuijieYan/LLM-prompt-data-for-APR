## Analysis:
1. The buggy function `copy` in the `S3CopyToTable` class from the file `luigi/contrib/redshift.py` is responsible for copying data from S3 to Redshift.
2. The issue reported on GitHub indicates that when `columns` are not provided (set to `None`), the `len(self.columns)` check in the `copy` function causes a `TypeError`.
3. The bug arises because the buggy function does not handle the case when `self.columns` is `None`. It directly checks the length of `self.columns`, leading to the `TypeError`.
4. To fix the bug, we need to modify the condition for checking the existence and length of `self.columns`.
5. The suggested fix from the GitHub issue is to change the line to `if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0`, which ensures that the `len(self.columns)` check is only done when `self.columns` is not `None`.

## Correction:
```python
# The corrected version of the buggy function

class S3CopyToTable(rdbms.CopyToTable, _CredentialsMixin):
    def copy_options(self):
        # Please ignore the body of this function

    
    def copy(self, cursor, f):
        """
        Defines copying from s3 into redshift.
    
        If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
        """
        logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
        colnames = ''
        if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:
            colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
            colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)
    
        cursor.execute("""
         COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
         CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
         {options}
         ;""".format(
            table=self.table,
            colnames=colnames,
            source=f,
            creds=self._credentials(),
            options=self.copy_options)
        )
```

By incorporating the suggested fix from the GitHub issue, we ensure that the length check is only performed when `self.columns` is not `None`, preventing the `TypeError` when `columns` are not provided.
