## Analysis:
The buggy function `copy` in the `S3CopyToTable` class is failing when `self.columns` is None, causing a `TypeError`. This bug is related to the GitHub issue titled "Redshift COPY fails in luigi 2.7.1 when columns are not provided", where the root cause is identified as a check on `len(self.columns)` without verifying if `self.columns` is not None.

## Issue:
The issue occurs because the buggy function assumes that `self.columns` will always have a value, leading to a `TypeError` when it is None.

## Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Check if `self.columns` is not None before checking its length.
2. If `self.columns` is not None, then proceed with processing.
3. If `self.columns` is None, handle the condition appropriately to avoid errors.

## Corrected Version:
```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:  # Check if self.columns is not None before checking its length
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options())
    )
```

In the corrected version:
- The `if` condition now checks if `self.columns` is not None before checking its length.
- If `self.columns` is not None, then the code proceeds to extract column names and form the query.
- If `self.columns` is None, the condition is not met, and the code skips processing the columns.
- Invocation of `self.copy_options()` should include parentheses to call the function.

By making these changes, the bug identified in the GitHub issue should be fixed, and the function should now handle the case when `self.columns` is None without causing a `TypeError`.
