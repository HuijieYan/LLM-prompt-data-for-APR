## Analysis:
The buggy function `copy` in the `S3CopyToTable` class of the `redshift.py` file is attempting to construct an SQL query for copying data from S3 into Redshift. The bug arises when there are no columns provided, leading to a `TypeError` due to an attempt to calculate the length of `self.columns`.

## Potential Error Location:
The error is likely to occur in the following line:
```python
if len(self.columns) > 0:
```

## Cause of the Bug:
The GitHub issue points out that the bug occurs when `self.columns` is `None`, resulting in a `TypeError` when trying to calculate the length of `None`. The fix proposed in the GitHub issue suggests checking if `self.columns` is not `None` before checking its length to avoid the error.

## Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to modify the line that checks the length of `self.columns` to first ensure that `self.columns` is not `None`. This modification will prevent the `TypeError` from occurring.

## Corrected Version:
```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

In the corrected version, we added a check `if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:` before processing the columns. This change ensures that the `TypeError` will not occur when `self.columns` is `None`, resolving the bug as reported in the GitHub issue.
