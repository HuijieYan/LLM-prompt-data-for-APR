## Analysis:
The buggy function `copy` in the `S3CopyToTable` class from `luigi/contrib/redshift.py` is failing when the `self.columns` is None. The bug is related to the `len` function being called on `self.columns` without checking if it is None. This issue is similar to the one reported in the GitHub issue, where the COPY operation fails when columns are not provided.

## Potential Error Locations:
- Calling `len(self.columns)` without checking if `self.columns` is None.

## Cause of the Bug:
The bug occurs because when `self.columns` is None, the `len` function is being called on a NoneType object, which results in a `TypeError`. The `len` function should only be called when `self.columns` is not None.

## Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to modify the line that checks the length of `self.columns` to first verify that `self.columns` is not None before calling `len(self.columns)`.

## Corrected Version:

```python
    def copy(self, cursor, f):
        """
        Defines copying from s3 into redshift.
    
        If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
        """
        logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
        colnames = ''
        if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:
            colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
            colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)
    
        cursor.execute("""
         COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
         CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
         {options}
         ;""".format(
            table=self.table,
            colnames=colnames,
            source=f,
            creds=self._credentials(),
            options=self.copy_options())
        )
```

In this corrected version, we check if `self.columns` is not None before trying to get its length. This change should prevent the `TypeError` when columns are not provided and should resolve the issue reported in the GitHub post.
