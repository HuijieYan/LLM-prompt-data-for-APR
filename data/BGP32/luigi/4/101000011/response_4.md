## Analysis:
The buggy function `copy` in the `S3CopyToTable` class of `luigi/contrib/redshift.py` is causing errors when `self.columns` is empty. This bug is related to a GitHub issue where `COPY` jobs fail when `columns` are not provided, resulting in a `TypeError`. The suggested fix in the GitHub issue involves checking if `self.columns` is truthy before calling `len(self.columns)` to prevent the error.

## Identified Error:
The buggy function does not check if `self.columns` is not empty before trying to get the length of `self.columns`. When `self.columns` is empty, a `TypeError` is raised.

## Cause of the bug:
The bug occurs because the `copy` function assumes that `self.columns` will always have values when constructing the `colnames` variable. If `self.columns` is empty, the attempt to join the column names will lead to an error due to an empty list. This issue was reported on GitHub, highlighting the specific scenario in which the bug occurs.

## Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to modify the code to check if `self.columns` is not None and has items before constructing the `colnames` variable. This change will ensure that the `COPY` statement is generated correctly even when `self.columns` is empty.

## Corrected Version:
```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:  # Check if self.columns is not None and has items
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options())
    )
```

In the corrected version, we first check if `self.columns` is not None and has items before processing the column names. This adjustment ensures the `copy` function can handle cases where no columns are provided without causing a `TypeError`.
