## Analysis:
- The buggy function `copy` in the `S3CopyToTable` class is responsible for executing a Redshift COPY command.
- The bug occurs when the `self.columns` attribute is not provided or is set to None, leading to an attempt to get the length of None, causing a `TypeError`.
- The reported GitHub issue suggests that the bug is related to the `self.columns` attribute not being handled properly when it is None.
- The suggested solution from the GitHub issue is to add a check for the existence of `self.columns` before attempting to get its length.

## Bug Cause:
The bug occurs because the code does not check if the `self.columns` attribute is None before trying to get its length. This causes a `TypeError` when `self.columns` is None.

## Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we should modify the code to check if `self.columns` is not None before attempting to extract the column names. This will prevent the `TypeError` when trying to get the length of None.

## Corrected Version:
Here is the corrected version of the `copy` function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.
    
    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    
    # Check if self.columns is not None before extracting column names
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)
    
    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options())
    )
```

In the corrected version, we added a check for the existence of `self.columns` before extracting the column names. This change ensures that the `TypeError` will not occur when `self.columns` is None.
