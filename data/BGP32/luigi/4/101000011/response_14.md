### Analysis:
The buggy function `copy` in the `S3CopyToTable` class is responsible for copying data from S3 into Redshift. The issue reported on GitHub indicates that when `self.columns` is set to `None` to prevent table creation, the function fails with a `TypeError: object of type 'NoneType' has no len()`.

### Error Location:
The cause of the bug lies in the following line:
```python
if len(self.columns) > 0:
```
Since `self.columns` can be `None`, attempting to get the length of `None` leads to the `TypeError`.

### Bug Cause:
The root cause of the bug is that when `self.columns` is set to `None`, the function does not handle this case gracefully. It assumes that `self.columns` will always contain a list of columns.

### Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to check if `self.columns` is not `None` before trying to get its length.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:  # Fixed the bug here
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

By checking if `self.columns` is not `None` before checking its length, we ensure that the function can handle cases where `self.columns` is `None` without causing a `TypeError`.
