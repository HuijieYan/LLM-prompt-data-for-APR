## Analysis:
The buggy function `copy` is failing when `self.columns` is None, causing a TypeError due to the attempt to get the length of a NoneType object. This issue is related to a GitHub bug report where it is mentioned that when columns are not provided, the Redshift COPY job fails with this error.

## Potential Error Location:
The line `if len(self.columns) > 0:` is the potential error location within the `copy` function where `self.columns` could be None, leading to a TypeError.

## Cause of the Bug:
The bug is caused by assuming that `self.columns` will always be a valid list. If the columns are explicitly set to None, the code breaks when trying to get the length of `None`.

## Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, it's necessary to first check if `self.columns` is not None before trying to get its length. By updating this check, we can avoid the TypeError when columns are not provided.

## Corrected Version:
```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options())
    )
```

In the corrected version, I added a check `if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:` before processing the columns to prevent the TypeError when columns are not provided. This fix aligns with the suggested solution in the GitHub issue to avoid the error when `self.columns` is None.
