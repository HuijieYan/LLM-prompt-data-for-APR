### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `copy` in the class `S3CopyToTable` in the file `luigi/contrib/redshift.py` is responsible for copying data from S3 into Redshift.
2. The issue reported on GitHub indicates that when running Redshift COPY jobs with `columns=None` to prohibit table creation, it fails due to a `TypeError` related to checking the length of `self.columns`.
3. The buggy function first checks the length of `self.columns` without verifying if `self.columns` is `None` or not, leading to the mentioned issue.
4. To fix the bug, we need to modify the condition that checks the length of `self.columns` to also include a check if `self.columns` is not `None` before checking its length.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
- Modify the conditional statement to check if `self.columns` is not `None` and then proceed to check its length.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns is not None and len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

By adding the check `if self.columns is not None` before checking the length, we ensure that the code does not attempt to find the length of `None`, addressing the reported issue on GitHub.
