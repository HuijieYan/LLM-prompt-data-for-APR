## Analysis:
1. The buggy function `copy(self, cursor, f)` is responsible for copying data from S3 to Redshift. It constructs a SQL query using string formatting to execute the `COPY` command.
2. The bug occurs when the `self.columns` attribute is not provided, resulting in an empty list which leads to a `TypeError` when trying to access its length.
3. The GitHub issue points out that the bug arises when trying to prohibit table creation by setting `columns` to `None`, causing the function to fail due to the mentioned `TypeError`.
4. The suggested fix is to add a check for `self.columns` to handle the case when it is not provided, preventing the `TypeError` by ensuring it is a valid list before accessing its length.

## Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
1. Update the function `copy(self, cursor, f)` to include a check for the existence of `self.columns` before trying to access its length.
2. If `self.columns` is not provided or is `None`, the code should handle this case gracefully without causing a `TypeError`.

## Corrected Version:
```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options())
    )
```

In the corrected version:
- We check if `self.columns` exists before accessing its length to prevent the `TypeError`.
- If `self.columns` is not provided or is empty, the query will execute without including column names.
- Also, the `copy_options` method should be called with parentheses `()` to execute it properly.

This corrected version addresses the bug reported in the GitHub issue.
