## Analysis:
The buggy function `copy` in the `S3CopyToTable` class within the `luigi/contrib/redshift.py` file is causing issues when trying to run Redshift COPY jobs without specifying columns. The bug leads to a `TypeError` due to the attempt to get the length of `self.columns` when it is `None`.

## Error Locations:
- The buggy line is `if len(self.columns) > 0:` in the `copy` function.
- The `copy_options` function is not being executed properly in the buggy function.

## Cause of the Bug:
The bug is triggered when attempting to get the length of `self.columns` without first checking if it exists (i.e., checking if it is `None`). This causes a `TypeError` when `self.columns` is `None`, as observed in the GitHub issue.

## Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to modify the condition checking for the existence and non-emptiness of `self.columns` before trying to get its length. Additionally, ensure that the `copy_options` function is properly executed and its result is included in the SQL query.

## Corrected Version:
```python
class S3CopyToTable(rdbms.CopyToTable, _CredentialsMixin):
    
    def copy_options(self):
        # Implementation of copy_options function
        
        
    def copy(self, cursor, f):
        """
        Defines copying from s3 into redshift.
    
        If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
        """
        logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
        colnames = ''
        if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:
            colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
            colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)
    
        cursor.execute("""
         COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
         CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
         {options}
         ;""".format(
            table=self.table,
            colnames=colnames,
            source=f,
            creds=self._credentials(),
            options=self.copy_options())
        )
```

In the corrected version:
- We added a check `if self.columns` before attempting to get its length to prevent the `TypeError` when `self.columns` is `None`.
- We also properly executed the `copy_options` function by adding parentheses `()` to call it and include its result in the SQL query.

This corrected version should resolve the issue reported in the GitHub bug related to Redshift COPY failures when columns are not provided.
