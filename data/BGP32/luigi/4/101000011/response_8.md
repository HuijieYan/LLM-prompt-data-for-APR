## Analysis:
The bug occurs in the `copy` function of the `S3CopyToTable` class in the `luigi/contrib/redshift.py` file. The issue arises when `self.columns` is None, causing a TypeError. This bug is related to a specific case where Redshift COPY jobs fail when columns are not provided, as reported in the GitHub issue.

## Identified Bug:
The bug in the `copy` function is in the following line:
```python
if len(self.columns) > 0:
```
When `self.columns` is None, the code throws a TypeError, leading to a failure in Redshift COPY jobs.

## Cause of the Bug:
The bug occurs when `self.columns` is None, and the code tries to get the length of None using `len(self.columns)`. This causes a TypeError since NoneType objects do not have a length.

## Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to check if `self.columns` is not None before attempting to get its length. By changing the conditional check, we can avoid the TypeError and prevent the Redshift COPY job failure.

## Corrected Version:
```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:  # Inserted a check for self.columns being not None
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

With this correction, the bug in the `copy` function related to the Redshift COPY job failure when columns are not provided should be resolved.
