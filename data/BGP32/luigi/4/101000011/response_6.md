### Analysis:
The buggy function `copy` is part of the `S3CopyToTable` class in the `luigi/contrib/redshift.py` file. The function is responsible for copying data from S3 to Redshift. The bug is related to the handling of columns when they are not provided. This issue is linked to a specific GitHub issue where it is mentioned that when columns are set to `None` to prevent table creation, an error occurs due to calling `len()` on a `NoneType`.

### Error Location:
The bug occurs in the `copy` function when checking the length of `self.columns` without validating if it's `None` or not.

### Cause of the Bug:
The bug happens because the buggy function does not properly handle the case when `self.columns` is `None`, resulting in a `TypeError` when trying to get the length of `None`.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to check if `self.columns` is not `None` before attempting to get its length.

### Corrected Version:
Here is the corrected version of the `copy` function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

In this corrected version, we first check if `self.columns` is not `None` before proceeding to calculate the `colnames`. This will prevent the `TypeError` when `self.columns` is `None`.
