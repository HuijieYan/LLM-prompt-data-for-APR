## Analysis:
- The buggy function `copy()` is part of the `S3CopyToTable` class in the `luigi.contrib.redshift` module.
- The issue reported on GitHub indicates that when `self.columns` is None, it causes a `TypeError` due to checking the length of `self.columns`.
- The proposed solution on GitHub suggests changing the check from `if len(self.columns) > 0` to `if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0` to handle the case where `self.columns` is None.

## Potential Error Location:
- The potential error location is when the length of `self.columns` is being checked in the buggy line: 
  ```python
  if len(self.columns) > 0:
  ```
  This check can result in a `TypeError` if `self.columns` is None.

## Cause of the Bug:
- The buggy function `copy()` is trying to construct a list of column names from `self.columns` and execute a SQL query using those columns. 
- When `self.columns` is None, the length check `len(self.columns)` triggers a `TypeError`.
- The code does not handle the case where `self.columns` could be None.

## Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
- To fix the bug, we should modify the length check for `self.columns` to handle the case where `self.columns` is None.
- We can update the check to `if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0` to ensure that `self.columns` is not None before checking its length.

## Corrected Version:
```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0: # Fix the bug by checking if self.columns is not None
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

By making this change in the `copy()` function, we ensure that the `self.columns` is not None before checking its length, addressing the issue reported on GitHub.
