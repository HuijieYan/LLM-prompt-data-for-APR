## Analysis:
1. The buggy function `copy` in the `S3CopyToTable` class is responsible for copying data from S3 into Redshift. 
2. The issue reported in GitHub mentions that when the `columns` attribute is set to `None`, it causes a `TypeError` since the buggy function does not handle this scenario properly.
3. The bug occurs because the buggy function assumes that `self.columns` will always be a list, leading to the error when it is `None`.
4. To fix the bug, we need to check if `self.columns` is not `None` before accessing its length in the `copy` function.

## Proposed Fix:
```python
    def copy(self, cursor, f):
        """
        Defines copying from s3 into redshift.
        
        If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
        """
        logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
        colnames = ''
        if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:
            colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
            colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)
    
        cursor.execute("""
            COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
            CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
            {options}
            ;""".format(
                table=self.table,
                colnames=colnames,
                source=f,
                creds=self._credentials(),
                options=self.copy_options())
        )
```

With this correction, we first check if `self.columns` is not `None` before trying to access its length in the `if` condition. This change will prevent the `TypeError` when `columns` is set to `None`. We also corrected a missing function call in the `options` field by adding `()` at the end of `self.copy_options`.
