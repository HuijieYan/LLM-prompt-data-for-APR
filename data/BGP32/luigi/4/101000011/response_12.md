### Analysis:
The buggy function `copy` in the `S3CopyToTable` class is encountering an issue when `self.columns` is None. This is causing a `TypeError` as it tries to get the length of a `NoneType`.

### Potential error location:
The error is likely caused by the line `if len(self.columns) > 0:` where `self.columns` can be None.

### Cause of the bug:
The root cause of the bug is related to the handling of `self.columns` when it is None. The bug was identified in the GitHub issue where it was pointed out that when `columns` are set as None to prohibit table creation, the `TypeError` occurs. This happens because the code attempts to get the length of `self.columns` without checking if it is None first.

### Strategy for fixing the bug:
To fix the bug, the code should check whether `self.columns` is not None before proceeding with getting its length. This change will prevent the `TypeError` when `columns` are explicitly set as None.

### Corrected version of the function:

```python
# Corrections made in the copy function to handle None value for self.columns
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    
    if self.columns:  # Check if self.columns is not None before processing
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options())
    )
```

By making this change, the bug related to handling `None` value for `self.columns` should be resolved, and the function should no longer raise a `TypeError` as described in the GitHub issue.
