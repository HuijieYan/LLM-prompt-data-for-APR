## Analysis:
The buggy function `copy` in the `S3CopyToTable` class is supposed to define copying from S3 into Redshift. The issue arises when the `self.columns` attribute is not provided and is None, leading to a `TypeError: object of type 'NoneType' has no len()` error.

The root cause of the bug is traced back to the line where the length of `self.columns` is checked without verifying if `self.columns` is None or not. This issue is related to a GitHub issue where Redshift COPY jobs fail in luigi 2.7.1 when columns are not provided.

## Bug Location:
The bug is located in the following line of code:
```python
if len(self.columns) > 0:
```

## Cause of the Bug:
The bug occurs because the code directly attempts to get the length of `self.columns` without considering the scenario where `self.columns` might be None. When `self.columns` is None, trying to get the length of None results in a `TypeError`.

## Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to modify the line `if len(self.columns) > 0:` to first check if `self.columns` is not None before attempting to get its length. The corrected logic should ensure that we only check the length of `self.columns` if it exists and is not None.

## Corrected Version:
Here is the corrected version of the `copy` function:
```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from S3 into Redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

In the corrected version, we added `if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:` to first check if `self.columns` exists before evaluating its length. This change avoids the `TypeError` when `self.columns` is None and addresses the issue reported in the GitHub bug.
