## Analysis:
The buggy function `copy` in the `S3CopyToTable` class has an issue related to the handling of the `columns` attribute. The bug occurs when `columns` is set to `None` and the length of `self.columns` is checked without validating if `self.columns` exists leading to the `TypeError: object of type 'NoneType' has no len()`.

The related function `copy_options` is expected to provide some options for the `COPY` command but doesn't directly relate to the bug itself.

The GitHub issue states that the bug occurs when trying to perform a Redshift `COPY` operation with `columns` set to `None` to prevent table creation. The suggested solution is to modify the condition to `if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:` to prevent the `TypeError`.

## Bug Cause:
The bug is caused by the buggy function `copy` not properly handling the case when `self.columns` is set to `None` before checking its length. The buggy code attempts to iterate over `self.columns` without confirming its existence, thus resulting in the mentioned `TypeError`.

## Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to modify the condition that checks the length of `self.columns` to ensure that `self.columns` is not `None` before proceeding with the length check.

## Corrected Version:
```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

By adding the condition `if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:` before accessing the length of `self.columns`, we ensure that the bug causing the `TypeError` is fixed, as recommended in the GitHub issue.
