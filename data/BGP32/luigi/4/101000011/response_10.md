## Analysis:
The buggy function `copy` in the `S3CopyToTable` class is responsible for copying data from S3 to a Redshift table. The bug occurs when the `columns` attribute is not provided, leading to a `TypeError` due to trying to get the length of a `NoneType` object.

The root cause seems to be related to the handling of the `columns` attribute in the `copy` function. The `columns` attribute is used to determine the names of the columns for the COPY command. If `columns` is not provided, the buggy function fails to check if it's `None` before trying to get its length.

## Bug Location:
The bug is located in the following line:
```python
if len(self.columns) > 0:
```
This line assumes that `self.columns` is always a list, leading to an error when `self.columns` is `None`.

## Cause of the Bug:
The bug occurs because the `copy` function does not handle the case where `self.columns` is `None` correctly. This causes a `TypeError` when trying to get the length of `None` which is not allowed.

## Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to first check if `self.columns` is not `None` before trying to get its length. This will prevent the `TypeError` when `columns` is not provided.

## Corrected Version:
```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    
    if self.columns is not None and len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

In the corrected version, I added a check `if self.columns is not None and len(self.columns) > 0:` before processing the `columns`, preventing the `TypeError` when `columns` is not provided. This fix aligns with the suggestion provided in the GitHub issue.
