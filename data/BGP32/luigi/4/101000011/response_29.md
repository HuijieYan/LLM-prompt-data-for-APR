### Analysis:
The buggy function `copy` in the `S3CopyToTable` class from the `luigi/contrib/redshift.py` file is failing when the `columns` attribute is not provided, resulting in a `TypeError` due to attempting to get the length of a `NoneType` object.

The related `copy_options` function is called within the `copy` function but is not directly related to the issue.

The GitHub issue points out that the bug occurs when `self.columns` is `None` and suggests a possible solution to check for `self.columns` before attempting to get its length to avoid the error.

### Identifying Potential Errors:
The potential error in the buggy function lies in the if statement checking the length of `self.columns` without verifying if `self.columns` is `None` first.

### Cause of the Bug:
The bug occurs because the code assumes that `self.columns` will always have a value, but if `self.columns` is not provided (i.e., is `None`), then trying to get the length of `None` will result in a `TypeError`.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to modify the if statement to first check if `self.columns` is not `None` before checking its length. This modification will prevent the `TypeError` when `self.columns` is not provided.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
    def copy(self, cursor, f):
        """
        Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

        If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
        """
        logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
        colnames = ''

        if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:  # Check if self.columns is not None
            colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
            colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

        cursor.execute("""
         COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
         CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
         {options}
         ;""".format(
            table=self.table,
            colnames=colnames,
            source=f,
            creds=self._credentials(),
            options=self.copy_options)
        )
```

By adding the check `if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0`, we ensure that we only attempt to get the length of `self.columns` when it is not `None`, thus fixing the bug reported in the GitHub issue.
