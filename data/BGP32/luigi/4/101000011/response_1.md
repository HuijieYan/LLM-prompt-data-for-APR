### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `copy` within the `S3CopyToTable` class in `luigi/contrib/redshift.py` is causing an issue when attempting to copy data from S3 to Redshift.
2. The bug is related to the handling of columns when they are not provided. The GitHub issue highlights that when `columns = None`, an error occurs due to a `TypeError` related to `len(None)`.
3. The buggy function tries to construct a query to copy data with columns, but it does not handle the case where columns are not provided properly. This leads to the error when trying to determine the length of `self.columns` if it is `None`.
4. The suggested solution in the GitHub issue is to explicitly check if `self.columns` is not `None` before trying to determine its length.
5. We should modify the buggy function `copy` to handle the case of `None` columns and adjust the query construction accordingly.

### Suggestions for Fixing the Bug:
1. Update the `copy` method to explicitly check if `self.columns` is not `None` before trying to determine its length. This will prevent the `TypeError`.
2. Adjust the query construction to handle the case when columns are not provided while copying data.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from S3 into Redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options())
    )
```

In the corrected version, we added a conditional check `if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0` to ensure that the length of `self.columns` is only calculated when it is not `None`. Additionally, we corrected the call to `self.copy_options` by adding parentheses to properly invoke the method. This should resolve the issue described in the GitHub report.
