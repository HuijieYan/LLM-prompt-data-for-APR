### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `copy` is part of the `S3CopyToTable` class in the `luigi.contrib.redshift` module.
2. The error message indicates a `TypeError` due to trying to use the `len` function on a `NoneType` object.
3. The error occurs in the line `if len(self.columns) > 0:` where the `columns` attribute is expected to be a list, but it is `None`.
4. To fix the bug, we need to handle the case where `self.columns` can be `None`.
5. We should add a check to see if `self.columns` is `None` before trying to extract column names to avoid the `TypeError`.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
1. Check if `self.columns` is `None` before trying to extract column names.
2. If `self.columns` is `None`, set `colnames` to an empty string.
3. Update the string formatting within the `cursor.execute` call to handle the case where `colnames` is an empty string.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns is not None:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute(
        """
         COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
         CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
         {options}
         ;""".format(
            table=self.table,
            colnames=colnames,
            source=f,
            creds=self._credentials(),
            options=self.copy_options())
    )
```

By adding the check `if self.columns is not None`, we ensure that the program will not attempt to call `len` on a `NoneType` object, avoiding the `TypeError`. We also need to call `self.copy_options()` function instead of just `self.copy_options` in the `cursor.execute` call.
