### Analysis:
The buggy function `copy` in the `S3CopyToTable` class is failing due to the following reasons:
1. The `copy` function relies on the `columns` attribute to construct the column names string, but it does not handle the case when `columns` is `None`.
2. The `columns` attribute is expected to be a list, but in the failing test, it is being passed as `None`, leading to a `TypeError` when trying to check its length.

### Strategy for fixing the bug:
To fix this bug and handle the case where `columns` is `None`, we need to add a check to ensure that `columns` is not `None` before attempting to access its length. We can provide a default behavior when `columns` is `None,` such as not constructing the `colnames` string.

### Corrected Version:
Here is the corrected version of the `S3CopyToTable` class with the `copy` function fixed:

```python
class S3CopyToTable(rdbms.CopyToTable, _CredentialsMixin):
    # Other functions and class attributes omitted for brevity

    def copy(self, cursor, f):
        """
        Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

        If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
        """
        logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
        colnames = ''
        if self.columns is not None and len(self.columns) > 0:
            colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
            colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

        cursor.execute("""
         COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
         CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
         {options}
         ;""".format(
            table=self.table,
            colnames=colnames,
            source=f,
            creds=self._credentials(),
            options=self.copy_options())
        )
```

In the corrected version:
- We check if `self.columns` is not `None` before trying to access its length.
- If `self.columns` is `None`, we don't construct the `colnames` string.
- The `copy_options` function is correctly called in `self.copy_options()`.
