### Analysis:
1. The buggy function is `copy` within the `S3CopyToTable` class in the `luigi/contrib/redshift.py` file.
2. The error occurs due to the comparison `if len(self.columns) > 0:` where `self.columns` is assumed to be a list but is None.
3. When the `columns` attribute is set to `None` in the `DummyS3CopyToTableKey` class, the comparison `len(None)` triggers a `TypeError`.
4. To fix the bug, we need to handle the case where `self.columns` is `None` before trying to calculate its length.
   
### Bug Fix Strategy:
- Check if `self.columns` is `None` before attempting to calculate its length to avoid the `TypeError`.
- If `self.columns` is `None`, proceed with the rest of the code without trying to access its length.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns is not None:  # Check if self.columns is not None
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options())
    )
```

By adding the check `if self.columns is not None:` before accessing its length, we avoid the `TypeError` and ensure that the function works correctly even when `self.columns` is `None`.
