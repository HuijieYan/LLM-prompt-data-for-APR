### Analysis:
1. The `copy` function in the `S3CopyToTable` class is supposed to insert data from S3 into Redshift. It constructs a SQL `COPY` command based on the attributes of the class.
2. The error occurs when trying to get the length of `self.columns`, which is expected to be a list of column names. However, in the failing test, `columns` is set to `None`, causing a `TypeError` when trying to call `len` on it.
3. The error message clearly states that the `NoneType` does not have a length, hence the `TypeError`.
4. To fix the bug, we need to handle the case where `self.columns` might be `None` and ensure that it is only processed if it is a list with elements.
5. The specific fix will involve checking if `self.columns` is not `None` and also that it has elements before constructing the `colnames` string.

### Proposed Fix:
1. Check if `self.columns` is not `None` and also has elements before constructing the `colnames` string.
2. If `self.columns` is `None` or an empty list, set `colnames` to an empty string.
3. Update the `copy` function to include this check.

### Corrected Version:
```python
# Import necessary library
import logging

# The corrected version of the copy function
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger = logging.getLogger()
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    
    if self.columns is not None and len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)
    else:
        colnames = ''
    
    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options())
    )
```

With this change, the corrected version of the `copy` function will handle the case when `self.columns` is `None`, preventing the `TypeError` encountered in the failing test.
