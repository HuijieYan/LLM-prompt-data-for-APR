### Analysis:
1. The `copy` function is expecting a list of columns from the `self.columns` attribute, but it is not handling the case when `self.columns` is `None`.
2. The error message indicates a `TypeError` due to trying to call `len` on a `NoneType`.
3. The issue arises when trying to check the length of `self.columns` before handling it as a list of columns.
4. We need to handle the case when `self.columns` is `None` by providing a default behavior or raising an informative error message.
5. We can fix the bug by checking if `self.columns` is `None` before trying to extract column names from it.


### Plan for Fixing the Bug:
1. Check if `self.columns` is not `None` before processing it to prevent a `TypeError`.
2. Provide a default behavior or raise an informative error if `self.columns` is `None`.
3. Ensure that the rest of the function logic remains intact after the bug fix.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns is not None and len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options())
    )
```

In the corrected version:
- We added a check `if self.columns is not None and len(self.columns) > 0` before processing `self.columns`.
- We are now ensuring that the code will only attempt to extract column names if `self.columns` is not `None`.
- We also corrected `self.copy_options` to `self.copy_options()` to call the function in the string formatting section.
