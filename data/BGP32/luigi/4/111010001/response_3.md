### Analysis:
- The buggy function `copy` in the `S3CopyToTable` class tries to access the `columns` attribute of the class instance, but the function does not handle the case when `self.columns` is `None`. 
- The error message indicates a `TypeError` since it is trying to call `len()` on a `NoneType` object.

### Bug Cause:
- The bug is caused by assuming that `self.columns` will always be a list, and not handling the case when it is `None`.
- The error occurs when the `len()` function is used on a `NoneType` object.

### Fix Strategy:
- To fix the bug, we need to check if `self.columns` is `None` before attempting to call `len()` on it. If it is `None`, we should handle that case appropriately.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns is not None and len(self.columns) > 0:  # Added a check for None
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options())
    )
```

### Changes Made:
- Added a check `if self.columns is not None and len(self.columns) > 0` to ensure that the `columns` attribute is not `None` before trying to get its length.
- Changed `options=self.copy_options` to `options=self.copy_options()` to correctly call the `copy_options` function.
