### Analysis:
1. The `copy` function in the `S3CopyToTable` class is attempting to access the length of `self.columns`, which is causing a `TypeError` when `self.columns` is `None`.
2. The error message indicates that `self.columns` is of type `NoneType`, which does not have a length that can be accessed using `len()` function.
3. The bug is in the `copy` function, specifically in the line where it checks the length of `self.columns` without considering that it could be `None`.
4. To fix the bug, we need to check if `self.columns` is `None` before trying to access its length. If it is `None`, we should handle it appropriately.
5. The fixed version of the `copy` function is provided below:

### Corrected Version:
```python
class S3CopyToTable(rdbms.CopyToTable, _CredentialsMixin):
    def copy_options(self):
        pass

    def copy(self, cursor, f):
        """
        Defines copying from s3 into redshift.
    
        If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
        """
        logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
        colnames = ''
        if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:  # Check if self.columns is not None
            colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
            colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

        cursor.execute("""
         COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
         CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
         {options}
         ;""".format(
            table=self.table,
            colnames=colnames,
            source=f,
            creds=self._credentials(),
            options=self.copy_options())
        )
```

With this change, it first checks if `self.columns` is not `None` before trying to access its length. If it is `None`, it will not attempt to access the length and the `TypeError` will be avoided.
