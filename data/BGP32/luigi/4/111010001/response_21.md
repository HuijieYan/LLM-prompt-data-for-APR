### Analysis:
1. The buggy function is `copy` within the `S3CopyToTable` class in the `luigi.contrib.redshift.py` module.
2. The error occurs when trying to check the length of `self.columns`, which is `None`.
3. The error message indicates that a `TypeError` is raised because an object of type `NoneType` does not have a length.
4. To fix the bug, we need to handle the case where `self.columns` is `None` before trying to access its length.
   
### Bug Fix Strategy:
- Check if `self.columns` is `None` before performing any operations on it.
- If `self.columns` is `None`, handle this case to prevent errors.
- Modify the logic to either use default column names or raise an exception if columns are not provided.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    if self.columns is None:
        raise ValueError("Columns must be provided for copying.")
    
    colnames = ''
    if len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options())
    )
```

In the corrected version:
- Before accessing the length of `self.columns`, we check if it is `None` and raise a `ValueError` if so.
- This modification ensures that the code handles the case where `columns` are not provided and prevents the `TypeError` that occurred before.
- Additionally, `self.copy_options` is called as a function `self.copy_options()` rather than a reference to the method, assuming it should return some value.
