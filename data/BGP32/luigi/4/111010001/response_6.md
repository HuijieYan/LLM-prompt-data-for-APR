### Analysis:
1. The `copy` function in the `S3CopyToTable` class is trying to check the length of the `columns` attribute but does not handle the case where `self.columns` is `None`.
2. The error occurs when the `self.columns` is `None` and the function tries to call `len(None)`.
3. The error message indicates a `TypeError` because trying to check the length of a `NoneType` object is not allowed.
4. To fix the bug, we need to handle the case where `self.columns` is `None` before trying to access its length.

### Suggested Fix:
We need to add a check to ensure that `self.columns` is not `None` before trying to access its length. If `self.columns` is `None`, we can set `colnames` to an empty string to avoid the error.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.
    
    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)
    
    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options())
    )
```

In the corrected version, we added a check `if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0` to ensure `self.columns` is not `None` before accessing its length. This change will prevent the `TypeError` when `self.columns` is `None`.
