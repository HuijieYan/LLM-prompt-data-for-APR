### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `copy` in the `S3CopyToTable` class is trying to check the length of `self.columns` to determine if there are any columns to be used in the `COPY` statement.
2. The error occurs because `self.columns` is None in the failing test case, leading to a `TypeError` when trying to get the length of None.
3. The error message clearly states that the issue is with trying to get the length of a `NoneType`.
4. To fix the bug, we need to handle the case where `self.columns` is None appropriately.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
Since `self.columns` can be `None`, we need to check for this condition before trying to get the length. If `self.columns` is `None`, we should set `colnames` to an empty string to avoid the `TypeError` when trying to get the length of `None`.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns:  # Check if self.columns is not None
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options())
    )
```

In the corrected version, we added a check `if self.columns:` to verify if `self.columns` is not `None`. If `self.columns` is `None`, `colnames` will remain an empty string as intended, resolving the `TypeError` issue.
