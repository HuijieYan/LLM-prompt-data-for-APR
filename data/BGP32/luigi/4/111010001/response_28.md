1. The buggy function `copy` within the `S3CopyToTable` class is attempting to access the length of `self.columns` without first checking if `self.columns` is `None`. This causes a `TypeError` when `self.columns` is `None`, as it cannot have a length.

2. The potential error location is in the line `if len(self.columns) > 0:` where `self.columns` is being accessed without proper validation.

3. The bug is caused by the assumption that `self.columns` is always a list or iterable, leading to the error when it is `None`. This is indicated in the error message `TypeError: object of type 'NoneType' has no len()` which highlights the attempt to access the length of a `None` type object.

4. To fix the bug, we need to check if `self.columns` is not `None` before attempting to access its length. If `self.columns` is `None`, we can handle it appropriately by setting `colnames` to an empty string in that case.

5. Here is the corrected version of the `copy` function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns is not None and len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
``` 

With this fix in place, the function will now first check if `self.columns` is not `None` before trying to access its length, avoiding the `TypeError` when `self.columns` is `None`.
