1. The buggy function `copy` is part of the `S3CopyToTable` class in the `luigi/contrib/redshift.py` file. This class is a template task for inserting a data set into Redshift from an S3 bucket. The `copy` function is responsible for defining the copying process from S3 into Redshift.

2. The potential error location in the `copy` function is the following line:
```python
if len(self.columns) > 0:
```
This line attempts to check if the `columns` attribute of the class is not empty before proceeding with the copying process. However, the error occurs because if `self.columns` is `None`, attempting to get the length of `None` raises a `TypeError`.

3. The cause of the bug is that the `columns` attribute is being set to `None` in the `DummyS3CopyToTableKey` instance, leading to the `TypeError` when checking its length in the `copy` function. The error message clearly indicates that an object of type `NoneType` (i.e., `None`) does not have a length attribute.

4. To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the `columns` attribute is not `None` before trying to access its length. One way to address this issue is by explicitly checking if `self.columns` is not `None` before attempting to get its length.

5. Here is the corrected version of the `copy` function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns is not None and len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join(x[0] for x in self.columns)
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options())
    )
```

In this corrected version, a check is added to ensure that `self.columns` is not `None` before checking for its length. This modification prevents the `TypeError` when trying to get the length of `None`.
