#### Analysis:
1. The buggy function is the `copy` function within the `S3CopyToTable` class in the `luigi.contrib.redshift` module.
2. The error message indicates a `TypeError: object of type 'NoneType' has no len()`. This means that the `self.columns` variable is of type `NoneType` when trying to access its length.
3. The buggy function is trying to construct a comma-separated list of column names if `self.columns` is not empty, but it fails when `self.columns` is `None`.
4. To fix the bug, we need to handle the case when `self.columns` is `None` and possibly add validation or default values for the `columns` attribute.

#### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
1. Check if `self.columns` is `None` before trying to access its length.
2. If `self.columns` is `None`, handle it gracefully by either providing default columns or raising an error if Columns are a required attribute.
3. Update the code to handle the `None` case appropriately.

#### Corrected Version:
```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
        """
        Defines copying from s3 into redshift.
    
        If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
        """
        logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
        colnames = ''
        if self.columns is not None and len(self.columns) > 0:  # Check if self.columns is not None before accessing its length
            colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
            colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)
        
        cursor.execute("""
         COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
         CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
         {options}
         ;""".format(
            table=self.table,
            colnames=colnames,
            source=f,
            creds=self._credentials(),
            options=self.copy_options())
        )
```

In the corrected version:
- We added a check `if self.columns is not None and len(self.columns) > 0` before trying to access the length of `self.columns`.
- If `self.columns` is `None`, `colnames` will remain an empty string.
- We also fixed the function call to `self.copy_options()` as it was missing parentheses.

This corrected version should now handle the case when `self.columns` is `None` without raising a `TypeError`.
