### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `copy` in the `S3CopyToTable` class is trying to check the length of the `self.columns` attribute, which is expected to be a list. However, in the failing test, the `columns` attribute is set to `None`.
2. When `self.columns` is `None`, attempting to perform `len(self.columns)` results in a `TypeError` because `NoneType` objects do not have a `len()` method.
3. The error occurs due to the assumption that `self.columns` will always be a list, which leads to an error when it evaluates to `None`.
4. To fix the bug, we need to handle the case where `self.columns` is `None` before checking its length.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Check if `self.columns` is `None` before attempting to get its length.
2. If `self.columns` is `None`, handle it appropriately by either setting `colnames` to an empty string or a default value.
3. Update the code such that it can handle both `None` and non-`None` values for `self.columns`.

### Corrected Version:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns is not None:  # Check if self.columns is not None
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

This corrected version includes a check for `self.columns` being `None` before trying to get its length. If `self.columns` is `None`, `colnames` will remain an empty string, avoiding the `TypeError`.
