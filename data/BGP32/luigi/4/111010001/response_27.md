### Analysis:
1. The buggy function is the `copy` method within the `S3CopyToTable` class in the `luigi/contrib/redshift.py` file.
2. The error occurs when trying to check the length of `self.columns` which is expected to be a list, but it is `None`.
3. The error message `TypeError: object of type 'NoneType' has no len()` indicates that `self.columns` is `None`.
4. To fix the bug, we need to handle the case where `self.columns` is `None` by defaulting it to an empty list.
5. By defaulting `self.columns` to an empty list, we ensure that even if no columns are specified, the length check will not throw an error.

### Correction:

```python
# The corrected version of the buggy function
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    
    columns = self.columns or []  # default to empty list if self.columns is None
    
    if len(columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
``` 

By defaulting `self.columns` to an empty list, we prevent the `TypeError` that was occurring due to `NoneType` not having a `len()` function. This corrected version should now pass the failing test.
