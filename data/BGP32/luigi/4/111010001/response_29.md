### Analysis:
- The buggy function `copy` in the `S3CopyToTable` class is failing because it is trying to access the length of `NoneType` object `self.columns` without checking if it is `None` first.
- The error message indicates a `TypeError` caused by trying to call `len()` on a `NoneType` object.
- The presence of `self.columns` being potentially `None` in the `copy` function is the cause of the bug.

### Strategy for fixing the bug:
- Check if `self.columns` is `None` before trying to access its length.
- If `self.columns` is `None`, handle this case appropriately.
- Consider providing a default behavior for when `self.columns` is `None`.

### Corrected version of the buggy function:
```python
class S3CopyToTable(rdbms.CopyToTable, _CredentialsMixin):
    def copy_options(self):
        # Please ignore the body of this function

    def copy(self, cursor, f):
        """
        Defines copying from s3 into redshift.
    
        If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
        """
        logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
        colnames = ''
        if self.columns is not None and len(self.columns) > 0:
            colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
            colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)
    
        cursor.execute("""
         COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
         CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
         {options}
         ;""".format(
            table=self.table,
            colnames=colnames,
            source=f,
            creds=self._credentials(),
            options=self.copy_options())
        )
```

### Justification:
- The corrected version of the `copy` function now checks if `self.columns` is `None` before accessing its length using `len()`.
- If `self.columns` is not `None`, it proceeds to generate `colnames` based on the columns. Otherwise, it will skip generating `colnames`.
- The corrected version also calls `self.copy_options()` to correctly include the copy options in the SQL query string.

By making these changes, the corrected version of the function should now handle the case when `self.columns` is `None` and prevent the `TypeError` that was previously occurring.
