### Analysis:
1. The `copy` function within the `S3CopyToTable` class in the `luigi/contrib/redshift.py` file is intended to copy data from S3 into Redshift based on the provided parameters.
2. The error message indicates a `TypeError` being raised due to the comparison within the `copy` function where it checks the length of `self.columns`.
3. The error message points out that `self.columns` is of type `NoneType`, which causes the error when trying to check its length using `len()`.
4. To fix the bug, we need to handle the case where `self.columns` is `None` properly to avoid the `TypeError`.
5. We can modify the code to include a check for `None` before trying to access the length of `self.columns` to prevent the error.

### Bug Fix:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:  # Check if self.columns is not None and has elements
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

By adding the condition `if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0`, we ensure that we only try to access the length of `self.columns` when it is not `None`, avoiding the `TypeError`. This fix should resolve the issue and allow the function to run without errors.
