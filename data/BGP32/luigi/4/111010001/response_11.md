### Analysis:
1. The function `copy` within the `S3CopyToTable` class is intended to define copying data from s3 to Redshift.
2. The error message indicates a `TypeError` that occurs when trying to check the length of `self.columns`, which is `None`.
3. The cause of the bug is that the `columns` attribute is being set to `None` when initializing the `copy` task, which results in a `NoneType` error when trying to check its length.
4. To fix this bug, we need to ensure that `self.columns` is not `None` before attempting to access its length.
5. We can update the code to check if `self.columns` is not `None` before processing it.

### Bug Fix:
Here is the corrected version of the `copy` function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns is not None and len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options())
    )
```

By adding the check `if self.columns is not None` before checking the length, we avoid the `TypeError` that was occurring due to `self.columns` being `None`. This fix ensures that we only process `self.columns` if it is not `None`.
