### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `copy` is responsible for copying data from S3 to Redshift.
2. The error occurs in the line `if len(self.columns) > 0:` due to `self.columns` being `None`.
3. The error message states `TypeError: object of type 'NoneType' has no len()`, indicating `self.columns` is `None` instead of a list.
4. To fix the bug, we need to ensure that `self.columns` is always a list before attempting to check its length.
### Bug Fix:
```python
# Fixing the buggy function
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.
    
    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    
    if self.columns is not None and len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)
    
    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```
By checking if `self.columns` is not `None` before accessing its length, we ensure that the code won't execute when `self.columns` is `None`, thus fixing the bug.
