### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `copy` is part of the `S3CopyToTable` class within the `luigi.contrib.redshift.py` file.
2. The `copy` function is expecting a non-null value for `self.columns` but in the failing test, the `columns` attribute is set to `None`.
3. The error message indicates that it is a `TypeError` caused by trying to call `len()` on a `NoneType` object.
4. To fix the bug, we need to check for `None` before trying to get the length of `self.columns`.
  
### Proposed Fix:
The issue can be resolved by adding a check for `None` before attempting to check the length of `self.columns`. If `self.columns` is `None`, the function should handle it accordingly.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
  
    if self.columns is not None and len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
``` 

After making this change, the function will safely handle the case where `self.columns` is `None`, preventing the `TypeError`.
