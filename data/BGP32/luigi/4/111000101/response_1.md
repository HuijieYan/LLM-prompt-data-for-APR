There are a few issues in the buggy function `copy` that need to be addressed:

1. The `copy_options` function is not being called properly. It should be called as `self.copy_options()` to execute the function and get the return value.

2. The `options` variable is not being properly formatted in the `cursor.execute` statement. It should be `self.copy_options()` instead of just `self.copy_options` to call the function and get the return value.

To fix the bug, we need to make these corrections in the `copy` function. Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options())
    )
```

By making these corrections, the `copy` function should now properly call the `copy_options` function and format the `options` variable correctly for the `cursor.execute` statement. This should fix the bug and the function should now satisfy the expected input/output values provided.
