## Analysis
The buggy function `copy` in the class `S3CopyToTable` is not correctly formatting the SQL query string for the `cursor.execute` method. The issue lies in the way the `copy_options` method is being included in the query string.

## Bug Explanation
The bug occurs because the `copy_options` method is not being called to get the actual options string. Instead, the method itself is being used in the string formatting, resulting in incorrect SQL syntax.

## Strategy for Fixing the Bug
To fix the bug, we need to call the `copy_options` method to get the options string before including it in the SQL query.

## Corrected Version
```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options())
    )
```

In the corrected version, I have added parentheses `()` after `self.copy_options` to call the method and include its return value in the SQL query string. This change ensures that the `copy_options` method is correctly used to get the options string.
