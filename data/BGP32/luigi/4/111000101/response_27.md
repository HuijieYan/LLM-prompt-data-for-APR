### Analysis
The buggy function `copy` in the `S3CopyToTable` class is failing to correctly format the SQL query to copy data from S3 into Redshift. The issue seems to be with the formatting of the `COPY` query string, specifically the interpolation of variables like `table`, `colnames`, `creds`, and `options`.

### Cause of the Bug
1. The `colnames` variable is not being properly formatted to include column names in the `COPY` query.
2. The `creds` value is being generated by calling the `_credentials()` method, but it is not provided what this method does.
3. The `options` value is intending to be a function call to `self.copy_options`, but it is missing parentheses to actually call the function.

### Fixing the Bug
1. Properly format the `colnames` variable to include column names if they exist.
2. Verify the functionality of the `_credentials()` method and make sure the `creds` variable is correctly incorporated in the `COPY` query.
3. Call the `self.copy_options()` function and assign its result to the `options` variable by including parentheses when calling the function.

### Corrected Version
```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute(
        """
         COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
         CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
         {options}
         ;""".format(
            table=self.table,
            colnames=colnames,
            source=f,
            creds=self._credentials(),
            options=self.copy_options()
        )
    )
```
In the corrected version, `self.copy_options()` is correctly called to get the options for the `COPY` query, and the parameters are formatted appropriately within the query string.
