### Analysis
The buggy function `copy` in the `S3CopyToTable` class is not correctly formatting the `COPY` SQL query to copy data from S3 to Redshift. The main issue lies in how the `copy_options` method is being used in the query string, where it should be called as a method instead of being passed as a reference.

### Bug
The bug occurs in the invocation of the `copy_options` method in the `cursor.execute` statement. Instead of calling `self.copy_options()` to execute the method, it is currently using `self.copy_options`, which is causing the method to not actually get executed.

### Fix
To fix the bug, we need to modify the line where `self.copy_options` is included in the SQL query to correctly call the method by adding parentheses.

### Corrected Version
```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options())
    )
```

Now, when the `copy` method is called, it will correctly include the output of the `copy_options` method in the SQL query for the `COPY` command.
