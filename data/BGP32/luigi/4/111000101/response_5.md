### Explanation:
The bug in the provided function is in the line where the `cursor.execute` method is called. The `copy_options` method is being accessed incorrectly. Instead of calling the method `copy_options()`, it is referencing the method itself without invoking it as `self.copy_options`.

### Strategy for fixing the bug:
We need to correct the reference to the `copy_options` method by invoking it using `self.copy_options()`.

### Corrected version of the function:

```python
    def copy(self, cursor, f):
        """
        Defines copying from s3 into redshift.
    
        If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
        """
        logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
        colnames = ''
        if len(self.columns) > 0:
            colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
            colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)
    
        cursor.execute("""
         COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
         CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
         {options}
         ;""".format(
            table=self.table,
            colnames=colnames,
            source=f,
            creds=self._credentials(),
            options=self.copy_options())
        )
```

By making this correction, the `copy` function should now correctly call the `copy_options` method to include the necessary options in the `COPY` command.
