### Analysis
The bug in the `copy` function is that `self.copy_options` is not being called as a function. It should be `self.copy_options()`. This is causing the `options` variable to be a function object instead of the result of calling the function.

### Strategy for fixing the bug
To fix the bug, we need to call `self.copy_options()` instead of `self.copy_options` in the `cursor.execute` statement.

### Corrected version of the buggy function
```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options()) # Fixed: added parentheses to call the function
    )
```
