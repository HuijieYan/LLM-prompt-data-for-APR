### Analysis
The buggy function `copy` in the `S3CopyToTable` class is trying to execute a SQL `COPY` command to copy data from an S3 source into a Redshift table. However, there are a few issues in the implementation:
1. The `self.copy_options` attribute is not being called as a function, which is likely intended to return a string with additional options for the `COPY` command.
2. There is a missing `format` method call for the `options` parameter in the `cursor.execute` statement.

### Bug Fixing Strategy
To fix the bug in the `copy` function, we need to:
1. Call the `self.copy_options()` function instead of just `self.copy_options`.
2. Add a missing `format` method call for the `options` parameter in the `cursor.execute` statement.

### Corrected Version
```python
    # this is the corrected version of the buggy function
    def copy(self, cursor, f):
        """
        Defines copying from s3 into redshift.
    
        If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
        """
        logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
        colnames = ''
        if len(self.columns) > 0:
            colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
            colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)
    
        cursor.execute("""
         COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
         CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
         {options}
         ;""".format(
            table=self.table,
            colnames=colnames,
            source=f,
            creds=self._credentials(),
            options=self.copy_options())
        )
```

With these changes, the corrected version of the `copy` function should now properly execute the `COPY` command with the necessary options.
