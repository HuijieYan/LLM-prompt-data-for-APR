### Analysis
The buggy function `copy` is supposed to copy data from an S3 bucket to a Redshift table. The bug in the function is that the `copy_options` function is not being called correctly. The function `self.copy_options` should be followed by `()` to call it as it is a method. 

### Bug
The bug is in the line:
```python
options=self.copy_options)
```
It should be:
```python
options=self.copy_options())
```

### Fix
To fix the bug, we need to call the `copy_options` method correctly.

### Corrected Version
```python
    def copy(self, cursor, f):
        """
        Defines copying from s3 into redshift.
    
        If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
        """
        logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
        colnames = ''
        if len(self.columns) > 0:
            colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
            colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)
    
        cursor.execute("""
         COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
         CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
         {options}
         ;""".format(
            table=self.table,
            colnames=colnames,
            source=f,
            creds=self._credentials(),
            options=self.copy_options())
        )
```
