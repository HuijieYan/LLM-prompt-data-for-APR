### Analysis
The buggy function `copy` in the `S3CopyToTable` class is not correctly formatting the SQL query to copy data from S3 to Redshift. Specifically, the `colnames` and `options` variables are not being populated correctly in the query string.

The `copy_options` method seems to be provided to set additional options for the `COPY` command, but it is not being invoked properly in the buggy function. Additionally, the `colnames` variable is not being correctly formatted with column names in the query string.

### Bug Explanation
1. The `colnames` variable is not properly constructed with column names to be inserted into the query string. This leads to incorrect SQL syntax.
2. The `options` attribute, which should contain additional options for the `COPY` command, is not being executed properly in the string formatting.

### Bug Fix
To fix the bug, we need to:
1. Properly format the `colnames` variable with column names.
2. Invoke and evaluate the `copy_options` method correctly to include any additional options in the query string.

### Corrected Version
```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options())
    )
``` 

In the corrected version, we have fixed the issue by invoking `self.copy_options()` to correctly include additional options in the SQL query and formatting `colnames` with column names.
