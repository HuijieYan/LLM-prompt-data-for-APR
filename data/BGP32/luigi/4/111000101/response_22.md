### Analysis
The bug in the `copy` function lies in the way `self.copy_options` is being used. The `self.copy_options` is supposed to be a function that returns options for the `COPY` command, but it is being used as if it is a string in the `cursor.execute` call. This will cause an error when trying to execute the SQL query.

### Bug Cause
The `copy_options` should be called as a function `self.copy_options()` to get the actual options string to include in the SQL query. However, in the buggy code, it is used as an attribute without being called as a function.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug
To fix this bug, we need to call the `self.copy_options()` function and include the returned options string in the SQL query.

### Corrected Version of the Function
```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options())
    )
```

In the corrected version, we have added `()` after `self.copy_options` to call the function and include the returned options string in the SQL query. This should fix the bug and allow the function to work as intended.
