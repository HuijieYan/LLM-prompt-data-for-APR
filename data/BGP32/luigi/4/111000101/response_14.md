### Analysis
The buggy function `copy(self, cursor, f)` in the `S3CopyToTable` class is supposed to copy data from S3 to Redshift. The bug seems to be in how the `copy` function is constructing the SQL query for the `cursor.execute` method. The `copy_options` method is not being called correctly as a function which might lead to missing necessary options in the SQL query.

### Bug cause
The bug is caused because the `copy_options` method is not being called correctly in the `cursor.execute` method. The line `options=self.copy_options` should be `options=self.copy_options()` to correctly call the `copy_options` method and get the necessary options for the query.

### Fix strategy
We should modify the `cursor.execute` method call in the `copy` function to correctly call the `copy_options` method by appending `()` to it to call it as a function.

### Corrected version
```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options())
    )
```
