### Analysis
The buggy function `copy` in the `S3CopyToTable` class is attempting to execute a `COPY` command in Redshift. The bug seems to be in the formatting of the SQL query string passed to `cursor.execute`. The `copy_options` function is not being called correctly, causing the bug.

### Bug Explanation
The bug occurs because the `copy_options` function is not being called correctly in the `cursor.execute` method. The original code is using `self.copy_options` without calling it as a function, which results in passing a reference to the function instead of the actual options. This causes the SQL query to have the wrong structure and fail when executed by the cursor.

### Bug Fix
To fix the bug, we need to call the `copy_options` function and include its return value in the `cursor.execute` method. This will ensure that the correct options are included in the SQL query. 

### Corrected Version
```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options())
    )
``` 

By making this change, the `copy_options` function will now be correctly called and its return value will be included in the SQL query, fixing the bug in the function.
