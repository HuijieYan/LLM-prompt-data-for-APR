### Analysis
The buggy function `copy` is trying to execute a `COPY` command to copy data from S3 into Redshift. However, there are a few issues:

1. The `copy_options` function is not being called correctly. It should be `self.copy_options()` with parentheses to call the function.
2. The `colnames` variable is not being correctly formatted as expected. It should be enclosed in parentheses only if there are columns defined.

### Bug
The main bug in the function is the incorrect usage of the `copy_options` function.

### Strategy for fixing the bug
To fix the bug, we need to call the `copy_options` function correctly, and conditionally include the `colnames` in the query based on whether columns are defined.

### The corrected version
```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)
    
    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options())
    )
```

By making the above changes, we have corrected the bug in the `copy` function.
