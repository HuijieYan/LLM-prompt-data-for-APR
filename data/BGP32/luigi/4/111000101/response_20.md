### Analysis
The buggy function `copy` in the `S3CopyToTable` class is trying to execute a Redshift `COPY` command, but there are some issues in the string formatting and function calls. 
- `colnames` is initialized as an empty string to hold the column names.
- The `COPY` command is being formatted with placeholders for `table`, `colnames`, `source`, `creds`, and `options`.
- The `colnames` placeholder is incorrectly formatted as a string like `(col1,col2,col3)` instead of just `col1,col2,col3`.
- The `options` placeholder is trying to call the `copy_options` function without parentheses, which will return the function object itself instead of executing it.

### Bug
The bug is in the formatting of the `COPY` command string:
- The `colnames` placeholder is incorrectly formatted.
- The `options` placeholder is not being called as a function.

### Fix
1. Fix the formatting of the `colnames` placeholder by removing the parentheses around the column names.
2. Call the `copy_options` function by adding parentheses after it.

### Corrected Version
```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
    
    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options())
    )
```
