### Analysis
The buggy function `copy` is supposed to copy data from S3 into Redshift using SQL `COPY` command. However, the bug lies in the way the `self.copy_options` function is being called. It is being referenced without using parentheses to call it as a function. This results in `copy_options` being passed as an object itself, rather than the value returned by the function call.

### Bug Cause
The bug causes the `copy_options` function to be passed as an object, rather than the expected string value to be included in the SQL query. This results in an error in the SQL query execution.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug
To fix the bug, we need to properly call the `copy_options` function by adding parentheses to ensure that the function is executed and its return value is used in the SQL query.

### Corrected Version
```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options())  # Fix: Call the copy_options function correctly
    )
```
