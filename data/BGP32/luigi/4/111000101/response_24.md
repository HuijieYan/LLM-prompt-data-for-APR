### Analysis
The buggy function `copy` is trying to execute a SQL `COPY` command to load data from an S3 source into a Redshift table. The bug seems to be related to the formatting of the SQL command string, especially in how `colnames` and `options` are being included in the query.

### Bug Explanation
1. The issue is with this line:
   ```python
   options=self.copy_options)
   ```
   The `copy_options` is a method that should be called to get the copy options, but the bug is missing the parentheses `()` to actually call the method and get the options.

### Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to call the `copy_options` method to get the copy options before formatting the SQL query string.

### Corrected Version
```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options())  # Fixed by calling the copy_options method
    )
```

Now, the `copy_options` method is correctly called within the `copy` function before formatting the SQL query string. This should resolve the bug in the function.
