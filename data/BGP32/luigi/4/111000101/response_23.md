### Identified bug:
The bug in the `copy` function lies in the way the `copy_options` function is being called. Instead of actually calling the `copy_options` function to get its output, the function is being passed as a reference, leading to incorrect SQL query generation.

### Strategy for fixing the bug:
To fix the bug, the `copy_options` function needs to be called to obtain the options string that it generates. This can be achieved by adding parentheses after `self.copy_options` to actually call the function.

### Corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options())  # Call the copy_options function to get the options string
    )
```

In the corrected version, `self.copy_options()` is called with parentheses to execute the function and obtain the options string to be included in the SQL query. This change ensures that the correct options are included in the `COPY` command for transferring data from S3 to Redshift.
