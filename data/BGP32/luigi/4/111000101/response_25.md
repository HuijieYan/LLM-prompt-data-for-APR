### Analysis
1. The buggy function `copy` in the `S3CopyToTable` class is supposed to define copying from s3 into Redshift. It constructs an SQL query using attributes like `table`, `columns`, `source`, `creds`, and `copy_options`.
2. The bug seems to be in how the `copy_options` function is being called. It is supposed to be a method call, but it is missing `()`.
3. The missing `()` at the end of the `self.copy_options` reference causes the bug. This results in `options=self.copy_options` being set to the function itself rather than the result of calling the function.
4. To fix the bug, we need to ensure that `self.copy_options` is correctly called as a method to get the actual copy options string.
5. We can fix the bug by adding `()` at the end of `self.copy_options` to call the function and get the required options string.

### Bug Fix
```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options()  # Fix: Adding () to call the function and get options string
    )
)
```
