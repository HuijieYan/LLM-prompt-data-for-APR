### Analysis
The buggy function `copy` is trying to execute a SQL `COPY` command from an S3 path into a Redshift table. The bug seems to be with the formatting of the SQL query string, especially in how `copy_options` function is being called.

### Bug
The bug lies in how `copy_options()` function is being called within the `cursor.execute()` statement:
- In the original code, `copy_options` is being passed as a reference to the function itself, instead of calling the function `self.copy_options()`. This results in the function not being executed, leading to incorrect SQL command construction.

### Fix
To fix the bug, we need to call the `copy_options()` function to get the actual options string in the SQL query.

### Corrected Version
```python
    def copy(self, cursor, f):
        """
        Defines copying from s3 into redshift.
    
        If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
        """
        logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
        colnames = ''
        if len(self.columns) > 0:
            colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
            colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)
    
        cursor.execute("""
         COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
         CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
         {options}
         ;""".format(
            table=self.table,
            colnames=colnames,
            source=f,
            creds=self._credentials(),
            options=self.copy_options())
        )
``` 

### Note
Make sure to replace the original buggy `copy` function with this corrected version in the `luigi/contrib/redshift.py` file.
