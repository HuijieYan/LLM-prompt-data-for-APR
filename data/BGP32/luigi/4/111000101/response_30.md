### Analysis
The buggy function `copy` is attempting to execute a SQL `COPY` command to copy data from an S3 source to a Redshift table. The bug seems to be in how the `copy_options` function is being called within the SQL query string interpolation. As it stands, `self.copy_options` is being treated as a method, but it should return a string value representing the copy options.

### Bug Cause
The bug is caused by the incorrect usage of `self.copy_options`. In the `cursor.execute` call, it should be `self.copy_options()` to call the method and get the correct copy options as a string.

### Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that `self.copy_options` is called as a method by adding parentheses `()` after it in the `cursor.execute` call.

### Corrected Version
```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options())
    )
```

In the corrected version, `self.copy_options()` is called with parentheses to correctly obtain the copy options as a string.
