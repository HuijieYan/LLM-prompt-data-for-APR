### Analysis
The buggy function `copy` in the `S3CopyToTable` class is attempting to execute a SQL `COPY` command to load data from an S3 file into a Redshift table. However, there are several issues with the current implementation:
1. The `copy_options` function is not being called correctly. It should be `self.copy_options()` instead of `self.copy_options`.
2. The `creds` value is not being correctly formatted within the SQL query.
3. The `colnames` variable seems to be incorrectly constructed.

### Bug Fix Strategy
1. Call the `copy_options` function correctly by adding parentheses to invoke it.
2. Ensure that the `creds` value is properly formatted within the SQL query by including it in single quotes.
3. Correctly construct the `colnames` variable by joining the column names properly.

### Corrected Version
```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS 'aws_access_key_id={access_key};aws_secret_access_key={secret_key}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        access_key=self.aws_access_key_id,
        secret_key=self.aws_secret_access_key,
        options=self.copy_options())
    )
```

In the corrected version:
- The `creds` value is formatted correctly within the SQL query using `aws_access_key_id` and `aws_secret_access_key`.
- The `copy_options` function is correctly called with parentheses.
- The `colnames` variable is properly constructed.
