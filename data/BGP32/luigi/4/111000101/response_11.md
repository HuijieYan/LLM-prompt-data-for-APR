### Analysis:
The buggy function `copy` in the `S3CopyToTable` class is supposed to define the copying process from an S3 bucket to a Redshift table. The bug seems to be in the way the `copy_options` method is being called within the `cursor.execute` statement.

The `copy_options` method should be invoked as a function rather than just referencing it as an attribute. This is causing the bug as the `options=self.copy_options` line should actually be `options=self.copy_options()`. 

### Bug Cause:
The bug is caused by directly referencing the `copy_options` method without actually calling it to retrieve the necessary copy options for the SQL query.

### Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to modify the `options=self.copy_options` line in the `cursor.execute` call to `options=self.copy_options()`, ensuring that the method is actually called and its return value is used as intended.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options())
    )
```
