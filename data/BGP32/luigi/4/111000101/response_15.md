The bug in the provided function is that the `copy_options` function is not being called correctly in the `cursor.execute` statement. The `copy_options` function should be invoked as a method by adding parentheses `()`. 

Here is the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options()) # Fix: Added parentheses to correctly call the method
    )
```

By making this correction, the `copy_options` function will be properly called as a method, which should resolve the bug. The corrected function should now satisfy the expected input/output values in the provided cases.
