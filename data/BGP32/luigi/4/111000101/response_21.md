### Analysis
The bug in the `copy` function lies in the way `copy_options` is called within the `cursor.execute` statement. The code is currently referencing the function itself (`self.copy_options`) instead of actually calling it as a method (`self.copy_options()`). This results in passing the function object itself instead of the return value of the function.

### Bug Cause
The buggy statement:
```python
options=self.copy_options
```

In this line, `self.copy_options` is referenced as a function object, but it should be called as `self.copy_options()` to retrieve the actual value.

### Proposed Fix
Change the buggy line inside the `cursor.execute` statement from:
```python
options=self.copy_options
```
to:
```python
options=self.copy_options()
```

### Corrected Version
```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options())
    )
```
