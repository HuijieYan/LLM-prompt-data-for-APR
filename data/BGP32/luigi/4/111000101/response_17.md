### Analysis
The buggy function `copy` is trying to execute a SQL `COPY` command to copy data from an S3 source into a Redshift table. The variable `self.copy_options` should be a function call, but it is missing parentheses at the end to actually call the function. This results in the `copy_options` function not being executed correctly, leading to a syntax error.

### Bug Cause
The bug occurs because the `copy_options` function is not being called correctly. The missing parentheses cause the function to be treated as a reference rather than being executed.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the `copy_options` function is called with parentheses at the end.

### Corrected Version
```python
    def copy(self, cursor, f):
        """
        Defines copying from s3 into redshift.
    
        If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
        """
        logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
        colnames = ''
        if len(self.columns) > 0:
            colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
            colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)
    
        cursor.execute("""
         COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
         CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
         {options}
         ;""".format(
            table=self.table,
            colnames=colnames,
            source=f,
            creds=self._credentials(),
            options=self.copy_options())  # Added parentheses to call the function
        )
``` 

This corrected version ensures that the `copy_options` function is properly called within the `cursor.execute` statement.
