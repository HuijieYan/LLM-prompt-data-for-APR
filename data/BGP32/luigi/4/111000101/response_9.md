### Analysis
The buggy function `copy()` in the `S3CopyToTable` class is attempting to construct and execute a SQL `COPY` command to load data from S3 into Redshift. However, there are a few issues in the implementation:
1. The `colnames` variable is not properly constructed when `self.columns` is not empty.
2. The `copy_options` function is not being properly called and its result is not being included in the SQL query.

### Bug Cause
The bug is caused by not properly constructing the `colnames` variable based on the `self.columns` attribute and not including the result of the `copy_options()` function in the SQL query.

### Fix Strategy
1. Properly construct the `colnames` variable based on the `self.columns` attribute.
2. Call the `copy_options()` function to get the necessary options and include them in the SQL query.

### Corrected Version
```python
    def copy(self, cursor, f):
        """
        Defines copying from s3 into redshift.
    
        If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
        """
        logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
        colnames = ''
        if self.columns:
            colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
            colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)
    
        cursor.execute("""
         COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
         CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
         {options}
         ;""".format(
            table=self.table,
            colnames=colnames,
            source=f,
            creds=self._credentials(),
            options=self.copy_options())
        )
```

In this corrected version, the `colnames` variable is properly constructed based on the `self.columns` attribute. Additionally, the `copy_options()` function is properly called to include the options in the SQL query.
