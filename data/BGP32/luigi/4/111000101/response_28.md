### Bug Explanation:

The bug in the `copy` function is due to passing the `self.copy_options` function object as a string in the `cursor.execute` call. This will not execute the `copy_options` function but will treat it as a string representation of the function, leading to unexpected behavior.

### Bug Fix Strategy:

To fix the bug, we need to call the `copy_options` function and include its return value in the SQL query string.

### Corrected Function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    options = self.copy_options()  # Call the copy_options function to get its return value
    
    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=options  # Use the return value of copy_options
    )
)
```

By making the above correction, the `copy_options` function should be called correctly, and its return value will be included in the SQL query as intended. This will fix the bug in the function.
