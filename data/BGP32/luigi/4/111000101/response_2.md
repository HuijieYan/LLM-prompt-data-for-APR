### Analysis
The buggy function `copy` in the class `S3CopyToTable` in the `luigi/contrib/redshift.py` file is attempting to execute a `COPY` command to transfer data from an S3 source to a Redshift table. The bug lies in how `copy_options` is being called and included in the SQL query string. The `copy_options` function is not being called correctly in the string interpolation, causing it to be treated as a method reference instead of a callable function.

### Bug Cause
The bug is caused by the line:
```python
options=self.copy_options)
```
The `copy_options` function is not being called with `()` at the end, which means the function reference is being passed instead of the result of calling the function.

### Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the `copy_options` function is actually called and its result is included in the SQL query string.

### Corrected Version
```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options())
    )
```

In the corrected version, the `copy_options` function is correctly called with `()` at the end to include its result in the SQL query string. Now the function should work as expected and pass the given test cases.
