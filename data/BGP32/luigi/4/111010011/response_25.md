### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `copy` in the `S3CopyToTable` class is trying to check the length of `self.columns` which is None if not provided. This leads to a `TypeError` when trying to get the length of a `NoneType` object.
2. The related function `copy_options` is being used within the buggy function `copy` but not called correctly.
3. The error message states that the length method is being called on a `NoneType` object.
4. To fix the bug, we need to modify the condition to check if `self.columns` is not None before trying to get its length.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
- Modify the condition that checks the length of `self.columns` to include a check for `None`.
- Update the code to properly call the `copy_options` method within the `cursor.execute` statement.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    
    if self.columns is not None and len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options())
    )
```

By making the above modifications, the `copy` function will now check if `self.columns` is not None before trying to get its length. This should resolve the `TypeError` that was occurring due to the buggy behavior.
