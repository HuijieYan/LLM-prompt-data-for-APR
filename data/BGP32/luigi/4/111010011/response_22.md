### Analyzing the buggy function and related information:

The buggy function `copy(self, cursor, f)` inside the `S3CopyToTable` class in `luigi/contrib/redshift.py` is throwing a `TypeError: object of type 'NoneType' has no len()` when the `columns` attribute is set to `None`.

From the provided class documentation and error message, we can deduce that the `columns` attribute needs to be provided and should not be `None` for the function to work properly.

Additionally, the GitHub issue suggests that the bug was introduced by a previous code change that removed the `and` condition in the `if` statement that checks for the presence of `self.columns` before calling `len(self.columns)`.

### Strategy for fixing the bug:
1. Modify the `if` condition checking the length of `self.columns` to also verify that `self.columns` is not `None`.
2. Implement the suggested change from the GitHub issue to prevent the `TypeError` when `columns` is `None`.

### Corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:  # Check if columns exist and not None before checking length
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options())
    )
```

By making the above changes, the function will now properly handle cases where `self.columns` is `None` without causing a `TypeError`, addressing the issue mentioned in the GitHub report.
