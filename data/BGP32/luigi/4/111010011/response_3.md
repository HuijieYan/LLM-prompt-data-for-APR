## Analysis:
1. The buggy function `copy` within the class `S3CopyToTable` is trying to check the length of `self.columns` attribute to determine if columns are provided for the Redshift COPY operation.
2. The error occurs when `self.columns` is `None`, causing a `TypeError` when trying to get the length of `NoneType`.
3. The bug is related to the GitHub issue that mentions the failure when `columns = None` and suggests a fix using `if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0`.
4. The bug can be fixed by updating the condition to check if `self.columns` is not `None` before trying to get its length.

## Fix:
```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:  # Check if columns are not None before getting length
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

By making this change in the conditional check, the function will handle the case where `self.columns` is `None` and avoid the `TypeError`. This updated version should pass the failing test and prevent the issue mentioned in the GitHub report.
