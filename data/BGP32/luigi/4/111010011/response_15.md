### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `copy` in the `S3CopyToTable` class is trying to check the length of `self.columns`, which is causing an error when `self.columns` is `None`.
2. The error message indicates a `TypeError` due to trying to get the length of a `NoneType`.
3. The related function `copy_options` seems to be fine, and the issue seems to be specifically with the `if len(self.columns) > 0` check in the `copy` function.
4. The GitHub issue suggests changing the condition to `if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0`.

### Bug Cause:
The buggy function is assuming that `self.columns` will always be a list, but when it is `None`, it raises an error when trying to get the length of `None`.

### Fix Strategy:
1. Modify the conditional check to first verify if `self.columns` is not `None` before checking its length.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options())
    )
``` 

By making this modification, the bug should be fixed, and the corrected version should pass the failing test as well as resolve the issue reported on GitHub.
