### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `copy` is within the class `S3CopyToTable`, which inherits from `rdbms.CopyToTable` and `_CredentialsMixin`.
2. The error message states that a `TypeError` is raised because `self.columns` is of type `NoneType`, which does not support the `len()` function.
3. The GitHub issue suggests that the bug was introduced in luigi version 2.7.1 and provides a possible solution to check `if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0`.
4. The bug occurs because the buggy function does not handle the case where `self.columns` is `None`.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is caused by the conditional check `if len(self.columns) > 0` without verifying if `self.columns` is `None`.

### Solution:
To fix the bug, we need to check if `self.columns` is not `None` before checking its length.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns is not None and len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

By adding the check `if self.columns is not None and len(self.columns) > 0`, we ensure that we only try to retrieve the length of `self.columns` if it is not `None`. This correction will prevent the `TypeError` when `columns` is `None`.
