### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `copy` in the `S3CopyToTable` class is trying to check the length of `self.columns` without handling the case where `self.columns` might be `None`. This leads to a `TypeError` when trying to apply `len()` on `None`.
2. The related function `copy_options` is invoked within the `copy` function but it is not handled correctly, causing the bug. The error message clearly indicates that `self.columns` is `None` which results in the error when checking its length.
3. The GitHub issue points out the specific problem of trying to check the length of `self.columns` without considering the case where it is `None`. The proposed fix suggests checking if `self.columns` has a truthy value before checking its length to avoid the `TypeError`.
4. To fix the bug, the `copy` function needs validation to ensure that `self.columns` is not `None` before trying to access its length. By following the suggestion from the GitHub issue, we can make the necessary adjustments to prevent the error.

### Proposed Fix:
Modify the `if len(self.columns) > 0:` line to check if `self.columns` is not `None` before checking its length.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

By making this change, the corrected function will now check if `self.columns` has a truthy value before attempting to get its length, avoiding the `TypeError` when `self.columns` is `None`. This fix should resolve the issue reported in the GitHub bug report and allow the function to run without errors.
