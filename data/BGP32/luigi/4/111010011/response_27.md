### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `copy(self, cursor, f)` inside the class `S3CopyToTable` in the `luigi/contrib/redshift.py` file is attempting to check the length of `self.columns` when it is expected to be a list, but it fails when `self.columns` is `None`.
2. The error message indicates a `TypeError` because it's trying to check the length of `NoneType`.
3. The GitHub issue points out that passing `columns=None` should not result in an error and suggests a potential solution to handle this scenario.
4. The strategy for fixing the bug would be to update the conditional check for `self.columns` to consider the case when it is `None`.

### Bug Cause:
The buggy function is assuming that `self.columns` will always be a list since it is later used to construct `colnames`. When `self.columns` is `None`, the function tries to check its length, resulting in a `TypeError`.

### Bug Fix:
Updating the conditional check for `self.columns` to consider the case when it is `None` will fix the bug.

Here is the corrected version of the function:
```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

By adding the check `if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:`, the function will only attempt to construct `colnames` if `self.columns` is not `None` and has at least one element.
