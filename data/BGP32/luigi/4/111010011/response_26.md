### Analysis:
1. The buggy function is `copy` within the `S3CopyToTable` class in the file `luigi/contrib/redshift.py`.
2. The error occurs when trying to check the length of `self.columns`, which is None.
3. The error message indicates a `TypeError` due to trying to get the length of a NoneType object.
4. The GitHub issue highlights that the error occurs when `columns` are not provided explicitly, leading to the bug.
5. The potential fix suggested in the GitHub issue is to modify the condition to `if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0`.

### Bug Explanation:
In the buggy function `copy`, the code tries to check the length of `self.columns` without first verifying if `self.columns` is not None. This leads to a `TypeError` when `self.columns` is None, as seen in the error message.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we should firstly verify that `self.columns` is not None before checking its length. This way, we avoid attempting to get the length of a NoneType object.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:  # Check if self.columns is not None before getting its length
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

By adding the check `if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0`, we ensure that the code only attempts to get the length of `self.columns` when it is not None, thus fixing the bug and addressing the failing test as well as the GitHub issue.
