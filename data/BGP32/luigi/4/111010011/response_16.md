## Analysis:
- The buggy function `copy` in the `S3CopyToTable` class expects `self.columns` to be a list, but it crashes with a `TypeError` when `self.columns` is `None`.
- The error message indicates that the issue is with trying to get the length of `None`, which is not allowed.
- The GitHub issue mentions that the bug was introduced in version 2.7.1 of Luigi due to changes made in a specific pull request.
- The suggested solution in the GitHub issue is to check if `self.columns` is truthy before checking its length.

## Potential Error Location:
- The bug is likely in the following line:
  ```python
  if len(self.columns) > 0:
  ```
  This line is assuming that `self.columns` is always a list, which causes the crash when `self.columns` is `None`.

## Cause of the Bug:
- The bug occurs because the code does not handle the case when `self.columns` is `None`.
- This issue was introduced due to changes made in a specific pull request, which assumed `self.columns` would always be a list.

## Suggested Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
- Modify the conditional check to handle cases where `self.columns` is `None`.
- Update the code to check if `self.columns` is truthy before checking its length.

## Corrected Version:
```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:  # Check if self.columns is truthy before checking its length
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)  # Ensure you call copy_options as a function
    )
```

By making this change, the corrected version should handle cases where `self.columns` is `None` and prevent the `TypeError` from occurring.
