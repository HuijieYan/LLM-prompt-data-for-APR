### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `copy` in the `S3CopyToTable` class is trying to access the length of `self.columns`, but is not handling the case where `self.columns` is `None`, resulting in a `TypeError`.
2. The error message indicates that `self.columns` is of type `NoneType`, which does not support the `len()` operation.
3. The related GitHub issue suggests that the bug was introduced in version 2.7.1 of Luigi and provides a solution to check for both `self.columns` existence and its length before accessing it.
4. The strategy for fixing the bug is to modify the condition for checking the length of `self.columns` to handle the case where it is `None`.

### Correction:
```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:  # Check if self.columns is not None before getting its length
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

By making this change in the `copy` function, the bug related to accessing the length of `self.columns` when it is `None` should be resolved.
