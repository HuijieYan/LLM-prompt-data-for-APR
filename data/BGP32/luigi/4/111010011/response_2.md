### Analysis:
1. **Buggy Function**: The `copy` function in the `S3CopyToTable` class from `luigi/contrib/redshift.py` is buggy.
2. **Related Functions**: The `copy` function calls `copy_options` internally.
3. **Error Message**: The error message indicates a `TypeError` when trying to get the length of a `NoneType`.
4. **GitHub Issue**: The GitHub issue suggests that the bug occurs when `columns` are not provided, and proposes a solution to check for `self.columns` before checking its length.

### Identified Bug:
- The bug occurs when `columns` are set to `None` which leads to a `TypeError` when trying to get the length of `None`.

### Fix Strategy:
- Modify the condition checking `self.columns` before trying to calculate its length.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:  # Fix: Check if self.columns is not None
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options())
    )
``` 

By making this change, we avoid the `TypeError` caused by trying to get the length of `None`, ensuring that the function works correctly even when `columns` are not provided.
