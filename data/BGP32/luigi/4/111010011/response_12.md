### Analysis:
1. **Buggy Function**: The buggy function is `copy` within the `S3CopyToTable` class in the `luigi/contrib/redshift.py` file.
   
2. **Relationship**:
   - The function `copy` is part of the `S3CopyToTable` class, which is a template task for inserting a data set into Redshift from S3.
   - The function `copy_options` within the same class is called within the `copy` function.

3. **Identified Error**:
   - The error occurs when `self.columns` is set to `None`, and the code tries to check `len(self.columns)`, which results in a `TypeError` because `NoneType` does not have length.

4. **Cause of the Bug**:
   - The bug occurs when `columns` are set to `None`, preventing table creation.
   - The code tries to evaluate the length of `self.columns` without first checking if `self.columns` is not `None`.
   - This causes a `TypeError`.

5. **Strategy for Fixing**:
   - The proposed solution mentioned in the GitHub issue suggests adding a check `if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0` to prevent the `TypeError`.
   - By adding this check, it ensures that if `self.columns` is not `None`, then only check its length.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from S3 into Redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:  # Check if columns are not None before checking length
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

By adding the check `if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0`, the corrected version ensures that the `TypeError` caused by `NoneType` is avoided, and the function should now handle the scenario where `columns` are `None`.
