### Analysis:
1. The buggy function is `copy()` within the `S3CopyToTable` class in the `luigi.contrib.redshift.py` file.
2. The error occurs in the line `if len(self.columns) > 0:` where it tries to get the length of `self.columns` which is `None`.
3. The bug is explained by the fact that when `self.columns` is `None`, it cannot be checked for length using `len()` directly. This error was introduced in a recent change related to handling `columns=None` scenario in Redshift COPY jobs.
4. A possible fix is to first check if `self.columns` is not `None`, and then proceed to check its length.
5. The fixed version of the function is provided below:

### Corrected Version:
```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:  # Check if columns is not None before checking its length
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
``` 

This correction should resolve the error related to `TypeError: object of type 'NoneType' has no len()`.
