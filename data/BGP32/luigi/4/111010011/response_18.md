### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `copy` in the `S3CopyToTable` class is trying to access the length of `self.columns` without checking if it is not `None`.
2. The error message indicates a `TypeError` due to trying to get the length of a `NoneType` object.
3. The GitHub issue mentions that passing `columns=None` to prohibit table creation causes the error.
4. The suggestion in the GitHub issue recommends checking if `self.columns` is not `None` before accessing its length.

### Bug Cause:
The bug occurs because the code does not handle the case where `self.columns` is `None`.

### Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to add a check before accessing the length of `self.columns` to ensure it is not `None`.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:  # Check if self.columns is not None
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options())
    )
```

In the corrected version, we added a check `if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:` to ensure that `self.columns` is not `None` before attempting to access its length. This fix should resolve the `TypeError` when `columns` is `None`.
