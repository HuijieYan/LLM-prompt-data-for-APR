### Analysis:
- The buggy function is `copy` within the `S3CopyToTable` class in the `luigi/contrib/redshift.py` file.
- The function is trying to determine the length of `self.columns`, which may be `None`.
- The error message indicates a `TypeError` due to trying to get the length of a `NoneType` object.
- The GitHub issue highlights that the problem arises when `columns` are not provided explicitly.
- The suggested solution involves checking if `self.columns` exists before trying to get its length.

### Error Cause:
The `TypeError` occurs in the `copy` function when attempting to get the length of `self.columns` without checking if `self.columns` is `None`.

### Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to modify the condition that checks the length of `self.columns` to ensure that we only do so when `self.columns` is not `None`.

### Corrected Version:
```python
    def copy(self, cursor, f):
        """
        Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

        If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
        """
        logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
        colnames = ''
        if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:  # Check if self.columns is not None before getting its length
            colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
            colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

        cursor.execute("""
         COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
         CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
         {options}
         ;""".format(
            table=self.table,
            colnames=colnames,
            source=f,
            creds=self._credentials(),
            options=self.copy_options())
        )
```

By incorporating the check `if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0` before trying to get the length, we ensure that the code does not throw a `TypeError` when `self.columns` is `None`.
