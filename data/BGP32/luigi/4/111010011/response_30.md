### Analysis:
1. The buggy function is `copy(self, cursor, f)` inside the `S3CopyToTable` class in the `luigi/contrib/redshift.py` file.
2. The error message is `TypeError: object of type 'NoneType' has no len()` when trying to perform `len(self.columns)` when `self.columns` is `None`.
3. The cause of the bug is that the `copy` function assumes `self.columns` is always a list and tries to get its length without checking if it is not `None`. This assumption leads to a `TypeError` when `self.columns` is `None`.
4. To fix the bug, we need to check if `self.columns` is not `None` before trying to get its length.
5. We will fix the buggy function in the corrected version.

### Corrected Version:
```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: luigi/contrib/redshift.py

# The declaration of the class containing the corrected function
class S3CopyToTable(rdbms.CopyToTable, _CredentialsMixin):
    """
    Template task for inserting a data set into Redshift from s3.
    
    Usage:
    
    * Subclass and override the required attributes:
    
      * `host`,
      * `database`,
      * `user`,
      * `password`,
      * `table`,
      * `columns`,
      * `s3_load_path`.
    
    * You can also override the attributes provided by the
      CredentialsMixin if they are not supplied by your
      configuration or environment variables.
    """

    # This function from the same class is called by the corrected function
    def copy_options(self):
        # Please ignore the body of this function

    # corrected function
    def copy(self, cursor, f):
        """
        Defines copying from s3 into redshift.
    
        If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
        """
        logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
        colnames = ''
        if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:  # Check if self.columns is not None before getting its length
            colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
            colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)
    
        cursor.execute("""
         COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
         CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
         {options}
         ;""".format(
            table=self.table,
            colnames=colnames,
            source=f,
            creds=self._credentials(),
            options=self.copy_options)
        )
``` 

By fixing the condition on `self.columns` before getting its length, we ensure that the bug causing the `TypeError` is resolved. This corrected version should now pass the failing test and address the issue reported on GitHub.
