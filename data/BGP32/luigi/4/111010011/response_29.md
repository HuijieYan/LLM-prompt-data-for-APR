### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `copy` in the `S3CopyToTable` class is trying to check the length of `self.columns` without first checking if `self.columns` is `None`, leading to a `TypeError` when trying to call `len()` on `None`.
2. The error message points out that the issue occurs when `columns` is `None`.
3. The GitHub issue highlights the exact problem where the buggy line is causing the error due to not handling the case where `self.columns` is `None`.
4. The suggested fix in the GitHub issue proposes to include an additional check for `self.columns` being truthy before checking its length to avoid the `TypeError`.

### Bug Cause:
The buggy line `if len(self.columns) > 0:` does not handle the scenario where `self.columns` is `None` which results in a `TypeError` when trying to get the length of `None`.

### Fix Strategy:
To resolve the bug, we should check if `self.columns` is not `None` before trying to get its length. By doing so, we can avoid the `TypeError` when `self.columns` is `None`.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

By making the check `if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:` we ensure that we are only attempting to get the length of `self.columns` when it is not `None`, thus avoiding the `TypeError` and resolving the bug as described in the GitHub issue.
