## Analysis:

The buggy function `copy` in the `S3CopyToTable` class is trying to check the length of the `self.columns`, but it does not handle the case where `self.columns` is `None`. This leads to a `TypeError` when trying to get the length of `None`. The issue reported on GitHub suggests a possible fix by checking if `self.columns` exists before checking its length.

## Potential Error Locations:
- The line where `len(self.columns)` is checked without verifying if `self.columns` is not `None`.

## Cause of the Bug:
The bug is caused by trying to get the length of `self.columns` without checking if it is `None`. When `self.columns` is `None`, attempting to get its length results in a `TypeError`. This behavior was introduced in a recent change according to the GitHub issue, which affects the functionality of copying data from S3 into Redshift.

## Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we should first verify if `self.columns` exists before checking its length. By adding a condition to check if `self.columns` is not `None` before proceeding with further operations, we can prevent the `TypeError` from occurring.

## Corrected Version:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:  # Fixed the bug by checking self.columns
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

By adding the condition to check if `self.columns` is not `None`, the corrected version of the function should now handle the scenario where `columns` are not provided correctly and avoid the `TypeError`.
