### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `copy` is trying to check the length of `self.columns`, which is causing a `TypeError` when `columns` is `None`.
2. The error message indicates that it is failing during the check for the length of `self.columns`.
3. The GitHub issue points out that the bug arises when `columns` are not provided, causing the `TypeError`.
4. A suggested solution from the GitHub issue is to modify the condition to `if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0` to handle the case where `columns` is `None`.

### Bug Cause:
The bug occurs because the code is directly trying to check the length of `self.columns` without first verifying if `self.columns` is not `None`.

### Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we should add a condition to check if `self.columns` is not `None` before checking its length.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:  # Check if self.columns is not None before checking length
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options())
    )
```

By adding the condition `if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0`, we ensure that the code does not try to access `NoneType` objects directly and avoids the `TypeError` that was occurring.
