## Analysis:
1. The buggy function `copy` within the `S3CopyToTable` class in the `luigi/contrib/redshift.py` file is causing a `TypeError` due to trying to check the length of `self.columns` when `columns` is `None`.
2. The error message points out that the issue occurs at line 338 of the `redshift.py` file.
3. The GitHub issue suggests that the problem arose after a specific pull request and recommends changing the conditional check on `self.columns` to prevent the `TypeError`.
4. The buggy function should be modified to check if `self.columns` is not `None` before trying to access its length.

## Solution:
To fix the bug, we need to update the conditional check on `self.columns` to ensure it's not `None` before checking its length.

## Corrected Version:
```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)
    
    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

By making this change, the corrected version of the function will now properly handle the case when `self.columns` is `None` and prevent the `TypeError` from occurring.
