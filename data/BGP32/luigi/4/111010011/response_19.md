## Analysis:
1. The buggy function `copy` in the `S3CopyToTable` class is trying to check the length of `self.columns`, which can be `None` in some cases.
2. The error message indicates a `TypeError` occurring when trying to get the length of a `NoneType` object.
3. The GitHub issue points out that this bug was introduced in version 2.7.1 of Luigi because of changes made in a specific pull request (PR #2245). The suggested solution is to modify the conditional check to prevent the `NoneType` error.
4. To fix this bug, we need to update the conditional check for `self.columns` to first ensure that it is not `None` before trying to get its length.

## Fix:
```python
    def copy(self, cursor, f):
        """
        Defines copying from s3 into redshift.
    
        If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
        """
        logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
        colnames = ''
        if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:  # Check if self.columns is not None before getting its length
            colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
            colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)
    
        cursor.execute("""
         COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
         CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
         {options}
         ;""".format(
            table=self.table,
            colnames=colnames,
            source=f,
            creds=self._credentials(),
            options=self.copy_options())  # Call the method to get copy_options
        )
```

By updating the conditional check in the `copy` function to first verify if `self.columns` is not `None`, we prevent the `TypeError` and ensure that the code runs smoothly. Additionally, make sure to call `self.copy_options()` to get the copy options correctly before executing the query.
