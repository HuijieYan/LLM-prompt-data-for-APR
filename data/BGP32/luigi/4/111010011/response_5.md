### Analyzing the buggy function:

1. **Buggy Class:** `S3CopyToTable` from `luigi/contrib/redshift.py`.
2. **Related Functions:** `copy_options()` is called by the buggy function.
3. **Error Message:** `TypeError: object of type 'NoneType' has no len()`.
4. **GitHub Issue:** The issue is related to Redshift COPY failing when columns are not provided, linked to a specific PR.

### Identifying potential error locations:
The error occurs due to checking the length of `self.columns`, which is `None`.

### Explaining the cause of the bug:
The code assumes `self.columns` is a list and checks its length without considering the possibility of it being `None`. When `self.columns` is `None`, it raises a `TypeError` during the length check, leading to the failure.

### Suggested strategy for fixing the bug:
Update the condition to explicitly handle the case where `self.columns` is `None` before checking its length.

### Corrected Version of the buggy function:
```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options())
    )
```

### Changes made:
- Added a condition to check if `self.columns` is not None before checking its length.
- Called `copy_options()` function with parentheses to execute it properly.
