### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `copy` is trying to check the length of `self.columns` which is causing a `TypeError` when `self.columns` is `None`.
2. The GitHub issue suggests that the bug was introduced in a specific pull request link provided.
3. The GitHub issue proposes a solution to change the line to `if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:` to avoid the `TypeError`.
4. The bug occurs due to the assumption that `self.columns` will always have a value, leading to the error when it is `None`.

### Fixing the bug:
To fix the bug, we need to modify the line checking the length of `self.columns` to ensure it does not throw a `TypeError` when `self.columns` is `None`. We can follow the suggestion from the GitHub issue.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:  # Check if self.columns is not None
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
``` 

By updating the condition to `if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:`, we ensure that the code does not attempt to find the length of `None`. This change should fix the `TypeError` and resolve the bug.
