### Analysis:
1. The `copy` function in the `S3CopyToTable` class is attempting to access the length of `self.columns`, which can be `None`.
2. The error message indicates a `TypeError: object of type 'NoneType' has no len()`.
3. The GitHub issue suggests a possible solution to check if `self.columns` is not `None` before trying to access its length.

### Bug Cause:
The bug occurs because the code does not check if `self.columns` is `None` before trying to access its length.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to add a check to verify if `self.columns` is not `None` before attempting to access its length.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:  # Check if columns is not None before checking length
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

By adding the `if self.columns` condition before checking the length, we ensure that the code handles the case where `self.columns` is `None` properly. This correction will address the TypeError that was occurring when `self.columns` is `None`.
