### Analysis:
The buggy function `copy` is failing due to the `TypeError: object of type 'NoneType' has no len()` error, which occurs when `self.columns` is `None`. The issue on GitHub has provided a suggested solution to check for `self.columns` before checking its length to avoid this error.

### Bug Cause:
The bug occurs because the buggy function does not handle the case where `self.columns` is `None`. It directly tries to access the length of `self.columns` without checking if it is `None` or not.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to modify the condition for checking the length of `self.columns` to first verify if `self.columns` is not `None`.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:  # Fixing the bug here by checking if self.columns is not None
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

By making this modification, the corrected version of the function will now handle the case where `self.columns` is `None` and avoid the `TypeError` that was causing the bug.
