### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `copy` in the `S3CopyToTable` class is expecting `self.columns` to be a list, but in the failing test, it is being set to `None`.
2. The error message clearly states that `TypeError: object of type 'NoneType' has no len()`, indicating that `self.columns` is set to `None`.
3. The GitHub issue points out that the bug occurs when `columns` are set to `None`, leading to the `TypeError`. The suggestion in the GitHub issue is to check `if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0` to handle the case where `self.columns` is `None`.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is caused by assuming `self.columns` is always a list without validating it, leading to the `TypeError` when `self.columns` is set to `None`.

### Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to check if `self.columns` is not `None` before proceeding to check its length.

### Corrected Version:
```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: luigi/contrib/redshift.py

# The declaration of the class containing the corrected function
class S3CopyToTable(rdbms.CopyToTable, _CredentialsMixin):
    """
    Template task for inserting a data set into Redshift from s3.
    
    Usage:
    
    * Subclass and override the required attributes:
    
      * `host`,
      * `database`,
      * `user`,
      * `password`,
      * `table`,
      * `columns`,
      * `s3_load_path`.
    
    * You can also override the attributes provided by the
      CredentialsMixin if they are not supplied by your
      configuration or environment variables.
    """


    def copy(self, cursor, f):
        """
        Defines copying from s3 into redshift.
    
        If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
        """
        logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
        colnames = ''
        if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:
            colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
            colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)
    
        cursor.execute("""
         COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
         CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
         {options}
         ;""".format(
            table=self.table,
            colnames=colnames,
            source=f,
            creds=self._credentials(),
            options=self.copy_options)
        )
```

By making the suggested change to check if `self.columns` is not `None` before checking its length, the corrected version of the function should now handle the case where `columns` are set to `None` without causing a `TypeError`.
