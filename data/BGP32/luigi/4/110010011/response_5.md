### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `copy` is part of the `S3CopyToTable` class in the `luigi/contrib/redshift.py` file.
2. The error message indicates a `TypeError` caused by trying to get the length of `self.columns` when it is `None`.
3. The GitHub issue suggests that this bug occurs when `columns` are not provided, and it proposes a solution to handle this scenario.
4. The bug occurs because the code directly checks the length of `self.columns` without first checking if it is not `None`.
5. To fix the bug, we need to modify the condition to first check if `self.columns` is not `None` before checking its length.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
1. Modify the condition check to ensure that `self.columns` is not `None` before proceeding to get its length.
2. Update the `if len(self.columns) > 0:` line to consider the case where `self.columns` is `None`.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

By making this change, the corrected version of the function should now handle the scenario where `columns` are `None` properly and not cause the `TypeError` mentioned in the error message.
