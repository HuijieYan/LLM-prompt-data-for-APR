### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `copy()` is part of the class `S3CopyToTable` in the `luigi.contrib.redshift` module.
2. The error message indicates a `TypeError` where the function is trying to get the length of `self.columns`, which is `None`.
3. The GitHub issue suggests that the problem arises when `columns` is set to `None` to avoid table creation, and the suggested fix is to check `if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0`.
4. The cause of the bug is that the function is not handling the case where `self.columns` is `None`.
5. The strategy for fixing the bug is to modify the condition check to `if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0` to avoid the `TypeError`.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.
  
    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

By implementing this change, the corrected version of the function will now properly handle the case when `self.columns` is `None`, preventing the `TypeError` that was occurring.
