### Error Analysis:
1. The error message indicates a `TypeError: object of type 'NoneType' has no len()`, specifically occurring in the `copy` function at line 338 of the `luigi/contrib/redshift.py` file.
2. The issue is related to a change made in a previous pull request (GitHub Issue #2245) which introduced a bug causing the `TypeError` when `columns` are `None`.
3. The `copy` function is attempting to check the length of `self.columns`, but since it is `None` due to not providing columns during initialization, it raises the `TypeError`.
4. The suggested solution on GitHub is to modify the conditional check to `if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:` to address this issue.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Update the conditional check in the `copy` function to first verify if `self.columns` exists and then proceed to check its length.
2. By making this change, we can prevent the `TypeError` when `columns` are `None`.
3. The fix involves ensuring that `self.columns` is not `None` before attempting to get its length.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:  # Check if self.columns is not None
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
