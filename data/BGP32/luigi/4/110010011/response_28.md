### Analysis:
- The buggy function is `copy` within the `S3CopyToTable` class in the `luigi/contrib/redshift.py` file.
- The error message indicates a `TypeError` due to `NoneType` object in the line `if len(self.columns) > 0:`.
- The GitHub issue provides insight into the problem, suggesting that the bug occurs when `columns` are not provided.
  
### Potential Error Locations:
- The line causing the issue: `if len(self.columns) > 0:`
  
### Cause of the Bug:
The bug occurs because when `columns` are set to `None` (not provided), an attempt to check the length of `None` results in the `TypeError`.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that `self.columns` is not `None` before trying to check its length. The suggested solution from the GitHub issue is to change the line to:
```python
if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:
```

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:  # Check if self.columns is not None before checking length
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

By making the suggested change to check for `self.columns` before checking its length, we can ensure the function does not encounter a `TypeError` when `columns` are not provided.
