### Analysis:
1. **Buggy function**: `copy` in the `S3CopyToTable` class from `luigi/contrib/redshift.py`.
2. **Bug location**: The bug occurs at the line `if len(self.columns) > 0:` where it tries to check the length of `self.columns`, which is None causing the TypeError.
3. **Cause of the bug**: The bug happens due to the assumption that `self.columns` will always be a list, but it can be `None` as mentioned in the GitHub issue. Since `self.columns` is `None`, trying to get its length (`len(None)`) causes a `TypeError`.
4. **Strategy for fixing the bug**: The fix involves adding an additional condition to check if `self.columns` is not `None` before trying to get its length. This strategy aligns with the suggestion provided in the GitHub issue.

### Updated Corrected Version:
```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

By adding the `if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:` condition, we ensure that the `len()` function is only called when `self.columns` is not `None`. This modification prevents the `TypeError` from occurring when `self.columns` is `None`.
