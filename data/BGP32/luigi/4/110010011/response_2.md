### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `copy` in the `S3CopyToTable` class is causing a `TypeError` when `self.columns` is `None`.
2. The error message indicates that the problem lies in trying to get the length of `self.columns` when it is of type `None`.
3. The GitHub issue suggests a solution to handle the case where `self.columns` is `None` before checking its length to avoid the `TypeError`.
4. A strategy to fix the bug would be to add a check to ensure `self.columns` is not `None` before attempting to get its length.
5. The corrected version of the `copy` function is provided below:

### Bug-fixed Version:
```python
    def copy(self, cursor, f):
        """
        Defines copying from s3 into redshift.
    
        If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
        """
        logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
        colnames = ''
        
        if self.columns is not None and len(self.columns) > 0:
            colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
            colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)
    
        cursor.execute("""
         COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
         CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
         {options}
         ;""".format(
            table=self.table,
            colnames=colnames,
            source=f,
            creds=self._credentials(),
            options=self.copy_options)
        )
```

By adding the check `if self.columns is not None and len(self.columns) > 0`, we ensure that we only try to access the length of `self.columns` when it is not `None`, resolving the `TypeError`.
