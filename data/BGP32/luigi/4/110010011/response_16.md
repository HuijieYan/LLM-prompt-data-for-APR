### Analysis:
1. **Buggy Function**: The `copy` function within the `S3CopyToTable` class is causing an error due to handling `NoneType` for the `columns` attribute.
2. **Error Location**: The error occurs in the line `if len(self.columns) > 0:` where it tries to check the length of `self.columns`, but it fails when `self.columns` is `None`.
3. **Cause of Bug**:
   - The bug occurs because when `columns=None` is passed to the `DummyS3CopyToTableKey` class, the `self.columns` attribute becomes `None`.
   - The error message `TypeError: object of type 'NoneType' has no len()` clearly indicates that it's trying to call `len()` on a `NoneType` object.
   - The provided fix in the GitHub issue suggests checking `if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:` which is a valid solution to handle `None` values for `self.columns`.
4. **Strategy for Fixing the Bug**:
   - Check if `self.columns` is not `None` before attempting to get its length.
   - If `self.columns` is `None`, skip the further processing related to `columns`.

### Corrected Version:
```python
# The declaration of the class containing the corrected function
class S3CopyToTable(rdbms.CopyToTable, _CredentialsMixin):
    """
    Template task for inserting a data set into Redshift from s3.
    
    Usage:
    
    * Subclass and override the required attributes:
    
      * `host`,
      * `database`,
      * `user`,
      * `password`,
      * `table`,
      * `columns`,
      * `s3_load_path`.
    
    * You can also override the attributes provided by the
      CredentialsMixin if they are not supplied by your
      configuration or environment variables.
    """

    # The corrected copy function
    def copy(self, cursor, f):
        """
        Defines copying from s3 into redshift.
    
        If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
        """
        logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
        colnames = ''
        if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:  # Check if columns is not None
            colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
            colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)
    
        cursor.execute("""
         COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
         CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
         {options}
         ;""".format(
            table=self.table,
            colnames=colnames,
            source=f,
            creds=self._credentials(),
            options=self.copy_options)
        )
```

By making the above correction in the `copy` function by checking `if self.columns` before getting its length, the error related to `NoneType` will be resolved. This correction aligns with the suggested fix mentioned in the GitHub issue.
