### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `copy` within the `S3CopyToTable` class in `luigi/contrib/redshift.py` is failing due to a `TypeError` when trying to check the length of `self.columns`, which is `None`.
2. The error occurs when trying to format the `colnames` variable if `self.columns` is provided as `None`.
3. The bug is causing issues with running Redshift COPY jobs when columns are not provided.
4. The proposed solution in the GitHub issue suggests checking if `self.columns` is not `None` before checking its length to prevent the `TypeError`.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
- Check if `self.columns` is not `None` before checking its length to avoid the `TypeError`.
- Update the code to handle the case where `self.columns` is `None` before formatting the `colnames` variable.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

By adding the `if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0` check, the corrected version of the `copy` function will now handle the case where `self.columns` is `None` without raising a `TypeError`.
