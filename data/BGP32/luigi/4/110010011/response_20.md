### Analysis:
- The buggy function `copy` in the `S3CopyToTable` class is attempting to check the length of the `self.columns` attribute, which can be `None`. This causes a `TypeError` when trying to get the length of `None`.
- The error message indicates that the issue occurs when `self.columns` is `None`, leading to a `TypeError: object of type 'NoneType' has no len()`.
- The GitHub issue confirms that the problem arises when `columns` is `None`.
- The suggested solution in the GitHub issue proposes changing the condition to `if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:` to handle the case when `self.columns` is `None`.

### Bug Cause:
The `copy` function in the `S3CopyToTable` class does not handle the case when the `self.columns` attribute is `None`. It directly tries to check the length of `self.columns`, leading to a `TypeError` when `self.columns` is `None`.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Modify the condition to check if `self.columns` is not `None` before attempting to get its length.
2. Update the `if` statement in the `copy` function to handle cases where `self.columns` is `None`.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

By adding the condition `if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:`, we ensure that the length of `self.columns` is only checked when `self.columns` is not `None`, thereby fixing the bug and addressing the issue reported on GitHub.
