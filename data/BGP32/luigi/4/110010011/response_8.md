### Analysis:

1. The buggy function `copy` is a method of the `S3CopyToTable` class within the `luigi.contrib.redshift` module.
2. The error message indicates a `TypeError: object of type 'NoneType' has no len()`, which occurs when trying to check the length of `self.columns` when it is `None`.
3. The issue on GitHub points out that this bug arises when trying to use `columns = None` to prevent table creation, causing the error. The suggested fix is to change the conditional check to `if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:` to handle the `None` case more gracefully.
4. To fix the bug, we need to update the conditional check in the `copy` method to handle the case when `self.columns` is `None`.

### Fix Strategy:
Update the if condition in the `copy` method to check if `self.columns` exists and has a length greater than 0 before proceeding with further operations.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

By making this change, we ensure that the code will gracefully handle the case when `self.columns` is `None`, as suggested in the GitHub issue. This corrected version should now pass the failing test and resolve the reported bug.
