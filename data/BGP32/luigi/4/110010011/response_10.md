### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `copy` in the `S3CopyToTable` class within the `luigi/contrib/redshift.py` file is attempting to check the length of `self.columns`, but it is not handling the case where `self.columns` is `None`.
2. The error message indicates a `TypeError` due to trying to get the length of a `NoneType` object.
3. The GitHub issue highlights that the bug occurs when `columns` is not provided, leading to a `TypeError`.
4. The suggested fix is to check if `self.columns` exists and then check its length, addressing the issue of handling the `None` case.

### Bug Cause:
The bug occurs because the code directly tries to check the length of `self.columns` without verifying if `self.columns` exists or if it is `None`. When `columns` is not provided and set as `None`, it causes a `TypeError` when trying to get the length of `None`.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
The strategy to fix the bug is to first check whether `self.columns` exists and then proceed to check its length. This will prevent the `TypeError` when `columns` is `None`.

### Corrected Version:
```python
    def copy(self, cursor, f):
        """
        Defines copying from s3 into redshift.
    
        If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
        """
        logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
        colnames = ''
        if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:  # Check if self.columns exists and has elements
            colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
            colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)
    
        cursor.execute("""
         COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
         CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
         {options}
         ;""".format(
            table=self.table,
            colnames=colnames,
            source=f,
            creds=self._credentials(),
            options=self.copy_options)
        )
```

By making the above change in the `copy` function, it now checks if `self.columns` exists before trying to get its length, fixing the bug identified in the GitHub issue.
