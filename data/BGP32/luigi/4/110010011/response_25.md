### Analysis:
The buggy function `copy` in the `S3CopyToTable` class is checking the length of `self.columns` without ensuring that it is not `None`. This leads to a `TypeError` when trying to get the length of `None`.

### Potential Error Location:
The line causing the error:
```python
if len(self.columns) > 0:
```

### Cause of the Bug:
The cause of the bug is that when `columns` is set to `None`, the function tries to check the length of `None`, which results in a `TypeError`.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to check if `self.columns` is not `None` before trying to get its length. By adding an additional condition to check if `self.columns` is truthy, we can avoid the `TypeError`.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

By adding the condition `if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:` before trying to access the length of `self.columns`, we ensure that the code doesn't throw a `TypeError` when `columns` is `None`.
