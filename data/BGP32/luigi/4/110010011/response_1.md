### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `copy` within the `S3CopyToTable` class is trying to check the length of `self.columns` without verifying if it's `None` or not. This leads to a `TypeError: object of type 'NoneType' has no len()` error when `self.columns` is `None`.
2. The error is happening due to the condition `if len(self.columns) > 0` without handling the scenario where `self.columns` is `None`.
3. The GitHub issue highlights that the problem arises when `columns` are set to `None`, causing the `TypeError`. The suggested solution is to modify the condition to `if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0`.
4. To fix the bug, we need to update the condition in the `copy` function to handle the case when `self.columns` is `None`.

### Proposed Fix:
```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:  # Check if self.columns is not None
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

By modifying the condition to `if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0`, we ensure that the code doesn't try to access the length of `self.columns` when it's `None`. This should resolve the `TypeError` issue when `columns` are not provided.
