### Analysis:
The buggy function `copy` in the `S3CopyToTable` class is causing an error when trying to check the length of `self.columns`, which is `None`. This error is triggered when running Redshift COPY jobs without providing the `columns` attribute, resulting in a `TypeError`.

The error message clearly states that `object of type 'NoneType' has no len()`, indicating that `self.columns` is `None` and cannot be used in the `len()` function call.

The GitHub issue mentioned suggests a possible solution by changing the if statement to accommodate the case where `self.columns` is `None`.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is caused by not handling the case where `self.columns` is `None` before trying to access its length in the `copy` function.

### Fix Strategy:
To fix this bug, we need to update the condition in the `copy` function to check if `self.columns` is not `None` before trying to get its length.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

By adding the condition `if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:`, we ensure that the code only tries to access the length of `self.columns` if it is not `None`. This correction addresses the bug identified in the code and resolves the failing test case as reported in the GitHub issue.
