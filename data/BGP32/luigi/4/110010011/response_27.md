### Analysis:
- The buggy function `copy` within the `S3CopyToTable` class in the `redshift.py` file is causing a TypeError when `self.columns` is `None`.
- The error message indicates that the issue arises from `if len(self.columns) > 0:` where it tries to find the length of a `NoneType` object.
- The GitHub issue suggests that the bug is caused by the assumption that `self.columns` will always have a value and proposes a potential solution to handle `self.columns` being `None`.

### Bug Cause:
- The bug is triggered when `self.columns` is None, and it occurs due to the assumption made in the buggy function that `self.columns` will always have a value.
- When `self.columns` is None, the comparison `len(self.columns) > 0` raises a TypeError since `NoneType` does not have a length property.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
- To fix the bug, we should modify the condition `if len(self.columns) > 0:` to handle the case when `self.columns` is None.
- We can use the proposed solution from the GitHub issue, which suggests changing the condition to `if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:` to handle the case when `self.columns` is None gracefully.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

By incorporating the suggested fix, the corrected version of the `copy` function will now handle the case when `self.columns` is None, thus resolving the TypeError issue.
