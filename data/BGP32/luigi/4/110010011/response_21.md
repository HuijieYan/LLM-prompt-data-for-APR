### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `copy` is defined within the `S3CopyToTable` class in the `luigi/contrib/redshift.py` file. The function is trying to check if `self.columns` has a length greater than 0, but due to the data being `None`, it causes a `TypeError: object of type 'NoneType' has no len()` error.
2. The error occurs when trying to determine the length of `self.columns` without checking if it is `None`.
3. The cause of the bug is that when `self.columns` is `None`, the function tries to get its length directly without first checking if it is not `None`. This causes the error mentioned above.
4. To fix the bug, we need to first check if `self.columns` is not `None` before trying to determine its length.
5. I will provide a corrected version below.

### Bug Fix:
```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns is not None and len(self.columns) > 0:  # Fix added here
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

In the corrected version, I added a check to ensure that `self.columns` is not `None` before accessing its length. This resolves the `TypeError` that was occurring due to trying to get the length of a `NoneType` object.
