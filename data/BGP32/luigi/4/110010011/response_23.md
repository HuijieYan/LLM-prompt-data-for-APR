### Analysis:
- The buggy function `copy` within the `S3CopyToTable` class in the `luigi/contrib/redshift.py` file is causing a `TypeError` when `self.columns` is `None`.
- The issue is related to a change in behavior introduced in luigi version 2.7.1, specifically in the way the `len` function is used on `NoneType`.
- The GitHub issue titled "Redshift COPY fails in luigi 2.7.1 when columns are not provided" provides insights into the root cause of the bug and suggests a possible solution.

### Potential Error Location:
- The error occurs when checking the length of `self.columns` without considering the case when `self.columns` is `None`.
- The `if len(self.columns) > 0:` line could lead to a `TypeError` when `self.columns` is `None`.

### Cause of the Bug:
- The bug is triggered when `self.columns` is `None`, and the buggy function attempts to get the length of `None` using `len(self.columns)`.
- In Python, calling `len(None)` directly results in a `TypeError`.
- The GitHub issue points out that the fix should check for `self.columns` existence before checking its length to avoid this error.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
- Modify the check for the length of `self.columns` to first verify if `self.columns` is not `None` before proceeding with the length check.
- This change will prevent the `TypeError` caused by trying to get the length of `None`.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:  # Check if self.columns exists and has a length
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

By adding the conditional `if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:` check, the corrected function avoids the `TypeError` that occurs when `self.columns` is `None`. This fix aligns with the suggested solution in the GitHub issue, resolving the problem reported related to Redshift COPY failures in luigi 2.7.1.
