### Analysis:
The buggy function `copy` in the `S3CopyToTable` class is causing a TypeError when the `columns` attribute is not provided. The error occurs when trying to check the length of `self.columns`, which is `None` in this case.

### Potential Error Locations:
- Checking the length of `self.columns` without verifying if it is not `None`.
- Incorrectly assuming that `self.columns` will always be provided.

### Cause of the Bug:
The bug occurs because the code directly tries to check the length of `self.columns` without first verifying that it is not `None`. When `columns` is not provided (set to `None`), the code encounters a TypeError when trying to apply `len()` to a `NoneType` object.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we should first confirm that `self.columns` is not `None` before checking its length. This can be done by adding a validation check for `self.columns` before checking its length to prevent the TypeError.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

In the corrected version, we added a validation check `if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:` to ensure that `self.columns` is not `None` before proceeding to check its length. This change will prevent the TypeError when `columns` is not provided.
