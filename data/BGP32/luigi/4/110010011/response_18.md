### Analysis:
The buggy function `copy` in the `S3CopyToTable` class is trying to check the length of `self.columns` without verifying if it is `None` or not. This causes a `TypeError` when `columns` is `None`. The error message indicates that `object of type 'NoneType' has no len()`, which aligns with the issue reported on GitHub regarding the failure when `columns` are not provided.

### Error Location:
The error is occurring at the line:
```python
if len(self.columns) > 0:
```

### Cause of the Bug:
The bug occurs because the code is directly checking the length of `self.columns` without confirming if it is `None` or not. When `columns` is `None`, the `len()` function cannot be applied to it, resulting in a `TypeError`.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix this bug, we need to first check if `self.columns` is not `None` before trying to get its length. This can be done by changing the condition to:
```python
if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:
```

### Corrected Version:
```python
    def copy(self, cursor, f):
        """
        Defines copying from s3 into redshift.
    
        If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
        """
        logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
        colnames = ''
        if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:
            colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
            colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)
    
        cursor.execute("""
         COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
         CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
         {options}
         ;""".format(
            table=self.table,
            colnames=colnames,
            source=f,
            creds=self._credentials(),
            options=self.copy_options)
        )
```

By making this change, the code will first verify if `self.columns` is not `None` before checking its length, preventing the `TypeError` when `columns` are not provided. This corrected version should resolve the issue reported on GitHub and pass the failing test.
