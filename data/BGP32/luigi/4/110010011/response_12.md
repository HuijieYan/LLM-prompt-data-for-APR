### Analysis:
1. The buggy function is the `copy` function within the `S3CopyToTable` class in the `luigi/contrib/redshift.py` file.
2. The error occurs when `self.columns` is None, and the code tries to check its length.
3. The error message states that it is a `TypeError` because an object of type 'NoneType' does not have a length.
4. The GitHub issue indicates that the bug was introduced in version 2.7.1 of Luigi due to a change in the logic for checking the length of `self.columns`.
5. The suggested solution in the GitHub issue is to modify the conditional check to `if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0`.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we will modify the conditional check for `self.columns` to ensure it is not None before checking its length. This approach will prevent the `TypeError` when `self.columns` is None.

### Corrected Version of the `copy` function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

By making this change, the corrected version of the `copy` function will handle cases where `self.columns` is None appropriately, preventing the `TypeError` mentioned in the GitHub issue.
