### Analyzing the buggy function and its context

The buggy function `copy` within the `S3CopyToTable` class in the `luigi.contrib.redshift` module is causing an error when the `columns` attribute is `None`. The error occurs because the code tries to check the length of a `NoneType` object, resulting in a `TypeError`.

The error message is clear: `TypeError: object of type 'NoneType' has no len()`, and it provides the exact location of the error within the `copy` function.

The corresponding GitHub issue suggests that the bug was introduced in luigi 2.7.1 and proposes a possible solution to fix the issue by modifying the conditional check for the `columns` attribute.

### Potential error locations
- The conditional check on line 338: `if len(self.columns) > 0`
- Handling of `None` value for `columns`

### Cause of the bug
The cause of the bug lies in the fact that the code does not check if the `columns` attribute is `None` before trying to get its length. When `columns` is `None`, the code attempts to check the length of a `NoneType` object, resulting in a `TypeError`.

### Strategy for fixing the bug
The suggested strategy to fix the bug is to modify the conditional check to first verify if the `columns` attribute is not `None` before checking its length. This will prevent the `TypeError` from occurring when `columns` is `None`.

### Corrected version of the function

```python
class S3CopyToTable(rdbms.CopyToTable, _CredentialsMixin):
    """
    Template task for inserting a data set into Redshift from s3.
    
    Usage:
    
    * Subclass and override the required attributes:
    
      * `host`,
      * `database`,
      * `user`,
      * `password`,
      * `table`,
      * `columns`,
      * `s3_load_path`.
    
    * You can also override the attributes provided by the
      CredentialsMixin if they are not supplied by your
      configuration or environment variables.
    """

    def copy(self, cursor, f):
        """
        Defines copying from s3 into redshift.
    
        If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
        """
        logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
        colnames = ''
        if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:  # Check if columns is not None before getting its length
            colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
            colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)
    
        cursor.execute("""
         COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
         CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
         {options}
         ;""".format(
            table=self.table,
            colnames=colnames,
            source=f,
            creds=self._credentials(),
            options=self.copy_options)
        )
```

By incorporating the suggested fix in the corrected version of the `copy` function, the code will now check if the `columns` attribute is not `None` before attempting to get its length, resolving the `TypeError` issue when `columns` is `None`.
