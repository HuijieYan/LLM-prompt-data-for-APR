### Analysis:
The buggy function `copy` within the `S3CopyToTable` class in `luigi/contrib/redshift.py` is causing an error when the `columns` attribute is set to `None`. The error occurs because the code is trying to check the length of `self.columns` without ensuring it is not `None` first.

The error message indicates a `TypeError: object of type 'NoneType' has no len()` is raised when `len(self.columns)` is attempted. This issue was reported on GitHub where it was highlighted that in certain cases, `columns` being set to `None` can lead to the failure of Redshift COPY jobs.

### Error Cause:
The root cause of the bug is that the code does not check whether the `self.columns` attribute is `None` before trying to access its length. When `columns` is set to `None`, the condition `if len(self.columns) > 0:` will throw a `TypeError` as `NoneType` does not have a length.

### Solution:
To fix the bug, we need to update the condition to first check if `self.columns` is not `None`, and then check its length. This change will prevent the `TypeError` raised when `columns` is `None`.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0: # Updated condition to check if columns is not None
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

By making this change, the bug should be fixed, and the code should now handle cases where `columns` is `None` without throwing an error. This correction aligns with the suggestion provided in the GitHub issue.
