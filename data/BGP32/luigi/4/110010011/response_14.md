### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `copy` is part of the `S3CopyToTable` class in `luigi/contrib/redshift.py`.
2. The error message indicates a `TypeError` due to calling `len()` on a `NoneType` object.
3. The GitHub issue points out that when `columns = None` is provided, it causes a failure in the Redshift COPY operation. The root cause is identified in a specific line within the `copy` function.
4. The proposed solution on GitHub suggests checking `if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0` instead of just `if len(self.columns) > 0`.

### Bug Explanation:
The bug occurs because the function checks the length of `self.columns` without verifying if it is `None` or not. When `columns = None` is provided, the condition `if len(self.columns) > 0:` triggers a `TypeError` since `NoneType` does not have a length.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we should first check if `self.columns` is not `None` before checking its length. This way, we avoid calling `len()` on a `NoneType` object.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

By modifying the condition to `if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:`, we ensure that the `len()` function is only called when `self.columns` is not `None`. This correction addresses the root cause of the bug reported in the GitHub issue.
