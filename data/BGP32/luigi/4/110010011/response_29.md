### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `copy` in the `S3CopyToTable` class is causing a `TypeError` when `self.columns` is `None`.
2. The error occurs when trying to check the length of `self.columns` without verifying if it's not `None`.
3. The bug is related to a change made in PR #2245 in the Luigi repository, causing issues when `columns` are set to `None`. The error message indicates that a `NoneType` object has no length.
4. To fix the bug, we need to modify the condition where the length of `self.columns` is checked to ensure that `self.columns` is not `None` before checking its length.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
Update the condition checking the length of `self.columns` to ensure that `self.columns` is not `None` before proceeding to determine its length.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:  # Check if self.columns is not None before checking its length
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
``` 

By making this modification, the code will first verify that `self.columns` is not `None` before checking its length, avoiding the `TypeError` when `columns` are set to `None`.
