### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `copy` in the `S3CopyToTable` class within the `luigi/contrib/redshift.py` file is failing due to an error when checking the length of the `columns` attribute, which is set to `None`. This error is causing the test case `test_s3_copy_with_nonetype_columns` to fail with a `TypeError`.
2. The error message indicates that the `columns` attribute is of type `NoneType` and cannot be used with the `len()` function.
3. The GitHub issue suggests that the root cause of this bug is related to changes made in a specific pull request (PR #2245) and proposes a solution to fix the issue by modifying the condition to check if `self.columns` is not `None` before checking its length.
4. To fix this bug, we need to update the condition in the `copy` function to handle the case where `columns` can be `None`.
5. Let's provide a corrected version of the `copy` function below:

### Correction:
```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

By updating the condition to check if `self.columns` is not `None` before checking its length, we can ensure that the code does not raise a `TypeError` when operating on a `NoneType` object. This correction should resolve the bug and allow the test case to pass successfully.
