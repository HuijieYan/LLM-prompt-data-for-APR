### Analysis:
The buggy function `copy` within the `S3CopyToTable` class in the `luigi/contrib/redshift.py` file is causing a `TypeError` when `self.columns` is `None`. The error occurs when trying to check the length of `self.columns` using `len()`.

### Error Locations:
The potential error locations in the buggy function are:
1. The statement `if len(self.columns) > 0:`.

### Cause of the Bug:
The cause of the bug is that when `self.columns` is `None`, the code tries to check the length of `None`, which results in a `TypeError`. This relates to the GitHub issue mentioned, where it was pointed out that when `columns = None` to prohibit table creation, the code fails due to the `len(self.columns)` check.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to modify the condition where the length of `self.columns` is being checked. Instead of relying on `len(self.columns)`, we can directly check if `self.columns` exists and is not `None`.

### Corrected Version:
Below is the corrected version of the `copy` function within the `S3CopyToTable` class:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

By making this change in the if condition to first check if `self.columns` exists and is not `None`, we avoid the `TypeError` when `columns = None`. This correction aligns with the suggestion provided in the GitHub issue.
