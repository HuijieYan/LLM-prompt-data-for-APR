### Analysis:
1. **Relationship with buggy class:** The buggy function `copy` is a method of the `S3CopyToTable` class in the `luigi/contrib/redshift.py` file.
   
2. **Error Location:** The error is occurring at line 338 where the length of `self.columns` is being checked without verifying if `self.columns` is not `None`.

3. **Cause of the Bug:**
    - The error message `TypeError: object of type 'NoneType' has no len()` indicates that the `self.columns` attribute is `None` when it is being checked for its length.
    - The GitHub issue suggests that in luigi 2.7.1, when `columns` is set to `None` to prohibit table creation, it leads to this error because the length check on `None` results in a `TypeError`.
    - The code is checking `if len(self.columns) > 0:` without considering the case when `self.columns` is `None`, leading to the error.

4. **Strategy for Fixing the Bug:**
    - Update the check from `if len(self.columns) > 0:` to `if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:` to first check if `self.columns` is not `None` before checking its length.
    - This change aligns with the suggested solution in the GitHub issue to avoid the `TypeError` when `columns` is `None`.

### Corrected Version of the `copy` function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:  # Check if self.columns is not None before getting its length
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
    ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

By making this change, the function now first ensures that `self.columns` is not `None` before attempting to get its length, which will prevent the `TypeError` when `columns` is set to `None`.
