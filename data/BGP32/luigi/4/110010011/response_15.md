### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `copy` within the `S3CopyToTable` class in the `luigi.contrib.redshift` module is causing a `TypeError: object of type 'NoneType' has no len()`. The error occurs when the `columns` attribute is set to `None`.
2. The error is related to a recent GitHub issue where Redshift COPY jobs fail in Luigi 2.7.1 when `columns` are not provided.
3. The buggy function is trying to access the length of `self.columns` without checking if it is `None`, which leads to the `TypeError`.
4. A possible strategy to fix this bug is to add an additional condition to check if `self.columns` is not `None` before attempting to retrieve its length.

### Corrected Version:
```python
class S3CopyToTable(rdbms.CopyToTable, _CredentialsMixin):
    # Other class declarations
    
    def copy(self, cursor, f):
        """
        Defines copying from s3 into redshift.
    
        If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
        """
        logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
        colnames = ''
        if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:
            colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
            colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)
    
        cursor.execute("""
         COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
         CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
         {options}
         ;""".format(
            table=self.table,
            colnames=colnames,
            source=f,
            creds=self._credentials(),
            options=self.copy_options)
        )
```

By checking if `self.columns` is not `None` before accessing its length, the corrected version of the function will prevent the `TypeError` from occurring when `columns` are not provided.
