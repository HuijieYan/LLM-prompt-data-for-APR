The bug in the `copy` function arises from trying to access the length of `self.columns` without checking if it is `None`. This issue corresponds to the GitHub issue titled "Redshift COPY fails in luigi 2.7.1 when columns are not provided". The solution involves modifying the check for `self.columns` before attempting to access its length.

To fix the bug:
1. Update the `copy` function to check if `self.columns` is not None before accessing its length.

Here is the corrected version of the `copy` function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns is not None and len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

With this correction, the `copy` function should now pass the failing test case and resolve the issue reported in GitHub when using Luigi 2.7.1.
