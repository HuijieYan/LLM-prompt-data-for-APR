### Analysis:
1. **Buggy Function**: The `copy` function in `luigi/contrib/redshift.py` has an issue where it fails when `self.columns` is `None`.
2. **Test Function**: The failing test `test_s3_copy_with_nonetype_columns` in `test/contrib/redshift_test.py` is triggering the bug by passing `columns=None` to `DummyS3CopyToTableKey` and running the task.
3. **Expected Input/Output**: The expected behavior is for the function to handle `columns=None` gracefully without causing a `TypeError` related to `NoneType`.
4. **GitHub Issue**: The GitHub issue points out that the bug occurred due to not checking if `self.columns` is None before trying to get its length in the `copy` function.

### Bug Cause:
The bug occurs because the code tries to perform `len(self.columns)` without checking if `self.columns` is `None`. This leads to a `TypeError: object of type 'NoneType' has no len()` when `self.columns` is `None`.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to add a check to ensure that `self.columns` is not `None` before trying to access its length. By adding a condition to check if `self.columns` exists and has a length greater than 0, we can prevent the `TypeError` from occurring.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

By adding the `if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:` check, we ensure that the code only attempts to access the length of `self.columns` if it is not `None`, thus fixing the bug related to `TypeError` when `self.columns` is `None`.
