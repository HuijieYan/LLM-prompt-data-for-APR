### Analysis:
The buggy function `copy` in `redshift.py` is failing when `self.columns` is `None`. This causes the line `if len(self.columns) > 0` to raise a `TypeError` due to trying to get the length of a `NoneType` object. The failing test `test_s3_copy_with_nonetype_columns` is aiming to check this scenario but fails due to the bug in the `copy` function.

### Error Location:
The issue lies in the condition `if len(self.columns) > 0` where `self.columns` can be `None`, leading to a `TypeError`.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is due to the assumption that `self.columns` will always be a list with one or more elements. However, in certain cases, such as when `self.columns` is `None`, this assumption is violated, causing the function to fail. This aligns with the GitHub issue describing the same problem when `columns` are not provided.

### Solution:
To fix the bug, we should modify the condition to check if `self.columns` is not `None` before checking for its length. This will prevent the `TypeError` when `self.columns` is `None`.

### Corrected Version:
```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: luigi/contrib/redshift.py

# corrected version of the buggy function
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

By making this change, the `copy` function will now handle cases where `self.columns` is `None` without raising a `TypeError`, resolving the issue reported in the GitHub thread.
