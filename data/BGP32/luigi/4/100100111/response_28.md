### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `copy` in the `luigi/contrib/redshift.py` file is responsible for copying data from S3 into Redshift. The bug seems to be related to handling columns when they are `None`.
2. The bug occurs when `self.columns` is `None`, causing a `TypeError: object of type 'NoneType' has no len()`.
3. The bug is causing the test `test_s3_copy_with_nonetype_columns` in `test/contrib/redshift_test.py` to fail. The expected input values are provided in the test function, and the bug is precisely identified in the GitHub issue mentioned above.
4. To fix the bug, the `colnames` variable needs to be constructed correctly when `self.columns` is `None`. We can check if `self.columns` is not `None` in the conditional statement before attempting to construct `colnames`.
5. I will provide the corrected version of the `copy` function below.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns is not None and len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

By checking if `self.columns` is not `None` before proceeding to construct `colnames`, we can avoid the `TypeError` when `self.columns` is `None`. This corrected version should pass the failing test and resolve the issue reported on GitHub.
