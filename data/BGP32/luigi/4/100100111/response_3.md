### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `copy` is trying to execute a `COPY` command in Redshift using provided parameters, including `self.columns` which is a list of columns. If no columns are provided (`self.columns` is `None`), the function should handle this case appropriately.
2. The failing test `test_s3_copy_with_nonetype_columns` creates a `DummyS3CopyToTableKey` task with `columns=None` and expects the `COPY` command to be executed with an empty `colnames`.
3. The GitHub issue describes a problem related to running Redshift `COPY` jobs with `columns=None` causing a `TypeError: object of type 'NoneType' has no len()`. The suggested solution is to check for `self.columns` to be non-empty before getting its length.
4. To fix the bug, we need to modify the code to check if `self.columns` is not `None` before processing it.

### Bug Explanation:
The bug occurs because the code directly tries to get the length of `self.columns` without first checking if it is `None`. This results in a `TypeError` when `self.columns` is `None`. The expected behavior should be to handle the case where `self.columns` is `None` by setting `colnames` to an empty string.

### Bug Fix:
To fix the bug, we should modify the code to check if `self.columns` is not `None` before processing it.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = '' if self.columns is None else ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

By incorporating the check for `self.columns is None` in the `colnames` assignment line, we ensure that the code handles the case of `None` columns correctly. This corrected version should now pass the failing test and resolve the issue reported on GitHub.
