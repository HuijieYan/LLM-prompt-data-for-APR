### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `copy` is failing when `self.columns` is `None`.
2. The failing test function `test_s3_copy_with_nonetype_columns` creates a task with `columns=None`, triggering the buggy behavior.
3. The GitHub issue provided explains that the bug occurs due to a `TypeError` when `self.columns` is `None`, leading to a call to `len(None)`. The suggested solution is to check if `self.columns` is not `None` before attempting to get its length.
4. To fix the bug, we need to update the condition checking the length of `self.columns` to first verify that `self.columns` is not `None`.

### Bug Cause:
The buggy code does not handle the case where `self.columns` is `None`. When attempting to get the length of `self.columns` without checking its existence first, a `TypeError` is raised.

### Bug Fix:
We need to modify the condition to first check if `self.columns` is not `None` before proceeding to get its length. This way, we prevent the `TypeError` when `self.columns` is `None`.

### Corrected Version:
```python
# The corrected version of the buggy function
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns is not None and len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

By making this change, the bug should be fixed, and the corrected function should now pass the failing test case `test_s3_copy_with_nonetype_columns`.
