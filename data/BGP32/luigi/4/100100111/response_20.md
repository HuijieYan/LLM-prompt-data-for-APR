### Analysis:
The buggy function `copy` in the `luigi/contrib/redshift.py` file fails to handle the case where `self.columns` is `None`. The issue is related to the use of `len()` on a `None` type object, causing a `TypeError` when trying to iterate over the columns.

### Error Location:
The error is likely to occur when the code attempts to construct the `colnames` string by iterating over the columns when `self.columns` is `None`.

### Cause of the Bug:
- The buggy function does not check if `self.columns` is `None` before trying to construct `colnames` from it. This leads to the `TypeError` since `None` does not have a `len()` function.
- The failing test sets the `columns` parameter of the `DummyS3CopyToTableKey` object to `None`, triggering the bug.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
- Check if `self.columns` is not `None` before constructing the `colnames` string.
- If `self.columns` is not `None`, proceed with constructing `colnames`; otherwise, leave it empty.

### Corrected Version of the `copy` Function:
```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

The corrected version of the `copy` function checks if `self.columns` is not `None` before trying to construct the `colnames` string. This modification ensures that the code does not encounter a `TypeError` when `columns` is `None`.

By applying this fix, the function should now pass the failing test case and address the issue reported on GitHub regarding Redshift COPY failures when columns are not provided.
