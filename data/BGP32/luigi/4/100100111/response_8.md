### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `copy` in `luigi/contrib/redshift.py` is trying to execute a SQL `COPY` statement to load data from S3 into Redshift. The issue seems related to handling the `self.columns` parameter when it is set to `None`.
2. The bug seems to be occurring when trying to construct the `colnames` variable using the `self.columns` parameter. Since `self.columns` is `None`, trying to get the length of `None` results in the error.
3. The GitHub issue indicates that when `columns` are `None`, the error occurs due to an attempt to get the length of `None`. The suggestion in the GitHub issue proposes checking if `self.columns` is not None before processing it.
4. To fix the bug, we should modify the conditional check for `self.columns` to include a check for `None` before trying to access its length.

### Correction:
```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from S3 into Redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns is not None and len(self.columns) > 0:  # Fixing the condition
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

By adding the check `if self.columns is not None and len(self.columns) > 0`, we ensure that the code only tries to process `self.columns` if it is not `None`. This correction will prevent the `TypeError` when `columns` are `None`.
