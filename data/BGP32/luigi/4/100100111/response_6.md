### Identified Bug:
The bug in the `copy` function is caused by the condition `if len(self.columns) > 0:`. When `self.columns` is `None`, it throws a `TypeError` since `NoneType` does not have the `len()` method.

### Cause of the Bug:
The bug occurs because the code assumes `self.columns` will always have a value, leading to an error when it is `None`. This issue was reported in a GitHub issue related to Redshift COPY failures when `columns` are not provided.

### Resolution Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to check if `self.columns` has a value before trying to access its length. By modifying the condition to `if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:`, we can ensure that the code does not throw an error when `self.columns` is `None`.

### Corrected Version of the `copy` function:
```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

By making this change, the `copy` function should now handle cases where `self.columns` is `None` without throwing any errors. This updated version should pass the failing test and resolve the issue reported in GitHub related to Redshift COPY failures.
