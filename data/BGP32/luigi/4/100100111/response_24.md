### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `copy` is supposed to execute a `COPY` command in Redshift, copying data from S3 into a Redshift table. The issue arises when `self.columns` is `None`.
2. The `copy` function is failing when `self.columns` is `None` because it attempts to get the length of `self.columns`, which results in a `TypeError` as `NoneType` has no `len()` method.
3. The failing test `test_s3_copy_with_nonetype_columns` creates a `DummyS3CopyToTableKey` task with `columns` set to `None`. It expects the `COPY` query to be executed without any column names when `columns` are `None`.
4. To fix this issue, we should check if `self.columns` is not `None` before attempting to get its length in order to avoid the `TypeError`.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
- Check if `self.columns` is not `None` before trying to get its length.
- Update the `copy` function to handle `self.columns` being `None` gracefully.

### Corrected Version of the `copy` function:
```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from S3 into Redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

By adding the check `if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:` before processing `self.columns`, the function will only attempt to get the length of `self.columns` if it is not `None`. This change will prevent the `TypeError` when `self.columns` is `None`.
