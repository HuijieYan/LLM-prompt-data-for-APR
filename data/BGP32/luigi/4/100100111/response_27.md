## Analysis
The buggy function `copy` in `luigi/contrib/redshift.py` is failing when `self.columns` is `None` because it tries to access the length of `self.columns` without checking if it's `None` or not. This causes a `TypeError` when trying to iterate over `self.columns` to construct `colnames`. The failing test case `test_s3_copy_with_nonetype_columns` in `test/contrib/redshift_test.py` aims to test this scenario.

The root cause of the bug is the assumption that `self.columns` will always be a list, leading to the `TypeError` when it is `None`. The GitHub issue provides insights into the problem and suggests a potential fix by checking if `self.columns` is not `None` before trying to access its length.

## Bug Fixing Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to modify the `copy` function to handle the case where `self.columns` can be `None`. We will modify the code to first check if `self.columns` is not `None` before trying to access its length and construct the `colnames` string.

## Corrected Version
```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns is not None:
        colnames_list = [x[0] for x in self.columns]
        colnames = ",".join(colnames_list)
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

This corrected version checks if `self.columns` is not `None` before constructing the `colnames` string. This modification ensures that the function does not attempt to iterate over `None`, resolving the `TypeError` issue when `self.columns` is `None`.
