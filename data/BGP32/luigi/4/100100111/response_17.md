### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `copy` in `luigi/contrib/redshift.py` is responsible for performing a `COPY` operation from S3 into Redshift. The bug seems to be related to the handling of columns when they are not provided.
2. The issue described on GitHub highlights the problem where providing `columns=None` leads to a `TypeError` due to an attempt to calculate the length of `self.columns` when it is `None`.
3. The buggy function fails to handle the case where `self.columns` is `None`, resulting in an empty `colnames` variable being created.
4. To fix the bug, we need to check if `self.columns` is not `None` before attempting to access its length.
5. The corrected version of the function should include a check for the existence of `self.columns` before processing it.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Modify the conditional statement `if len(self.columns) > 0:` to `if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:` to avoid the `TypeError` when `self.columns` is `None`.
2. Check if `self.columns` is not `None` before constructing the `colnames` string.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
# The corrected version of the buggy function
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

By updating the conditional check for `self.columns` in the `copy` function, the bug related to handling `None` columns should be resolved. The corrected function should now pass the failing test and satisfy the expected input/output values while addressing the issue described on GitHub.
