### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `copy` in the `luigi/contrib/redshift.py` file is intended to copy data from S3 into Redshift. The issue occurs when `self.columns` is None, leading to a `len()` function call on a NoneType object.
2. The `copy` function constructs a SQL `COPY` statement using various attributes (`self.table`, `self.columns`, `f`, etc.).
3. The failing test `test_s3_copy_with_nonetype_columns` creates a task with `columns=None` and expects the `COPY` statement to have an empty `colnames`.
4. The GitHub issue relates to the same problem, indicating that the code is failing when `columns` are not provided (i.e., None), resulting in a `NoneType` error.

### Bug Cause:
The bug occurs due to the assumption that `self.columns` will always have a value before processing, leading to the issue when it is None in some cases.

### Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to handle the case where `self.columns` is None before attempting to get the length of it.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

By checking if `self.columns` is not None before getting its length, the corrected version of the function should now handle the case where `columns` are None and prevent the error from occurring.
