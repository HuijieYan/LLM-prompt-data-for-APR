### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `copy` in the `redshift.py` file is responsible for copying data from S3 into Redshift. The bug seems to be related to handling the `columns` parameter when it is `None`.
2. The bug occurs when the `columns` attribute is `None`, causing an error when trying to iterate over it to form the `colnames` string.
3. The bug causes a `TypeError: object of type 'NoneType' has no len()` due to attempting to call `len(self.columns)` when `self.columns` is `None`, as highlighted in the GitHub issue.
4. To fix the bug, we need to check if `self.columns` is not `None` before trying to form the `colnames` string.

### Bug Fix:
```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

By adding the condition `if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:` before processing `self.columns`, we ensure that the code only tries to form the `colnames` string when `self.columns` is not `None` and has elements in it.

This fix addresses the bug highlighted in the failing test and aligns with the suggested solution in the GitHub issue related to the bug.
