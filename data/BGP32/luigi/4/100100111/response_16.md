### Error locations in the buggy function:
The potential error in the buggy function lies in the check for the length of `self.columns` without validating if `self.columns` is not None.

### Cause of the bug:
The buggy function fails when `self.columns` is None because it attempts to check the length of `self.columns` without first verifying if `self.columns` is not None. This leads to a `TypeError` since `NoneType` does not have a length attribute.

### Strategy for fixing the bug:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that we only check the length of `self.columns` if `self.columns` is not None. We can achieve this by adding a check to validate if `self.columns` is not None before proceeding with obtaining the length.

### Corrected version of the function:
Here is the corrected version of the `copy` function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

By adding the condition `if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0`, we ensure that the length of `self.columns` is only checked if `self.columns` is not None, resolving the `TypeError` when `self.columns` is None. This corrected version will pass the failing test and satisfy the expected input/output values while resolving the GitHub issue related to the bug.
