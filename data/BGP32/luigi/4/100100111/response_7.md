### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `copy` in the `luigi/contrib/redshift.py` file is responsible for executing a `COPY` command in Redshift from an S3 source.
2. The function constructs a SQL query using input parameters like `table`, `colnames`, `source`, `creds`, and `options`.
3. The bug occurs when `self.columns` is `None`, causing an error when trying to get the length of `self.columns`.
4. The failing test `test_s3_copy_with_nonetype_columns` creates a task with `columns=None`, which triggers the bug in the `copy` function.
5. The expected behavior is for the function to handle `columns=None` gracefully by setting `colnames=''`.
6. The GitHub issue suggests a possible fix to modify the condition check for `self.columns`.

### Bug Explanation:
The bug in the `copy` function arises because the code tries to get the length of `self.columns` without checking if it is `None`. When `columns=None`, the `len(self.columns)` operation causes a `TypeError`. The expected behavior should be to set `colnames=''` when `self.columns` is `None`.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we should modify the condition checking for `self.columns` to handle the case when it is `None`. The fix involves ensuring that `self.columns` is not `None` before attempting to get its length.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns is not None and len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

By adding the condition `if self.columns is not None and len(self.columns) > 0:`, we make sure that the code only tries to get the length of `self.columns` when it is not `None`. This modification resolves the bug described in the failing test and aligns with the suggested fix in the GitHub issue.
