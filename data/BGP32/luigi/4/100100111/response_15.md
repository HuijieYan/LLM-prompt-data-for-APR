### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `copy` in the `luigi/contrib/redshift.py` file is designed to perform a Redshift COPY operation from S3, but it has a bug related to handling column names if they are not provided.
2. The bug occurs when `self.columns` is `None`, leading to a `TypeError: object of type 'NoneType' has no len()`.
3. The failing test `test_s3_copy_with_nonetype_columns` expects the `colnames` to be an empty string, but the buggy function does not handle the case where `self.columns` is `None` correctly.
4. The suggested fix in the GitHub issue is to update the condition to `if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0`.
5. The corrected version of the function needs to include this conditional check to prevent the `TypeError` when `self.columns` is `None`.

### Bug Fix:
```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

By adding the conditional check `if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0`, we ensure that the `colnames` variable is only constructed if `self.columns` is not `None`. This fix addresses the bug and aligns with the suggested solution from the GitHub issue.
