### Analysis:
- The buggy function `copy` in `luigi/contrib/redshift.py` is designed to copy data from S3 into Redshift. The bug seems to be related to the way it handles the `columns` attribute, as mentioned in the GitHub issue related to this bug.
- The failing test `test_s3_copy_with_nonetype_columns` in `test/contrib/redshift_test.py` creates a task with `columns` set to `None` and expects the `colnames` variable to be an empty string.
- The bug is causing an error due to `NoneType` not having a `len()` function, leading to a `TypeError`.
- The suggested fix from the GitHub issue is to check if `self.columns` is truthy before checking its length.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is caused by the buggy function's assumption that `self.columns` will always have a value. When `columns` is `None`, the buggy function tries to get the length of `None`, leading to a `TypeError`. This issue reflects the behavior described in the GitHub issue.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we should modify the condition that checks the length of `self.columns` to first check if `self.columns` is not `None`. If `self.columns` is truthy, then we can proceed to get its length.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from S3 into Redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

By making this change, the `copy` function will first check if `self.columns` is truthy before trying to get its length, effectively resolving the bug and passing the failing test.
