### Analysis:
The buggy function `copy` in the `redshift.py` file is failing when `self.columns` is `None`. The issue is related to the handling of `self.columns` when constructing `colnames`.

### Bug Location:
The bug is likely located in the following lines:
```python
if len(self.columns) > 0:
colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
```

### Cause of the Bug:
The bug occurs because when `self.columns` is `None`, trying to calculate `len(self.columns)` raises a `TypeError`. This matches the reported GitHub issue where the failure happens due to trying to get the length of `None`.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we should add a null check for `self.columns` before trying to access its length and generate the column names. We can modify the code to only construct `colnames` when `self.columns` is not `None`.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    
    if self.columns is not None and len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

By adding the null check `if self.columns is not None` before trying to access the length of `self.columns`, we avoid the `TypeError` that was causing the bug. This corrected version should now pass the failing test and handle the case where `self.columns` is `None`.
