### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `copy` is responsible for copying data from S3 into Redshift. The bug occurs when `self.columns` is `None`, leading to a `TypeError` due to trying to get the length of `None`.
2. The bug is caused by not checking if `self.columns` is `None` before trying to use it in the code.
3. The GitHub issue mentions that running Redshift COPY jobs with `columns = None` to prevent table creation fails due to this bug.
4. To fix the bug, we need to update the code to first check if `self.columns` exists before trying to access its length.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Modify the code to check if `self.columns` is not `None` before proceeding to use it.
2. If `self.columns` is not `None`, proceed to retrieve the column names.
3. Otherwise, set `colnames` to an empty string.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

By adding the check `if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0`, we ensure that the code only tries to extract column names if `self.columns` is not `None`. This correction should address the bug and resolve the GitHub issue related to Redshift COPY failures when `columns` is set to `None`.
