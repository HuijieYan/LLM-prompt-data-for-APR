### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `copy` is failing when `self.columns` is `None`. It tries to access the length of `self.columns` without checking if it is `None`.
2. The failing test `test_s3_copy_with_nonetype_columns` creates an instance of `DummyS3CopyToTableKey` with `columns` set to `None` and expects the `colnames` variable to remain empty.
3. The GitHub issue indicates that the bug occurs when `columns` are set to `None`, resulting in a `TypeError`.
   
### Bug Cause:
The buggy function fails due to the lack of a check for `None` value in `self.columns`. When `self.columns` is `None`, it tries to access its length, causing a `TypeError`.

### Fix Strategy:
Introduce a check to handle the case when `self.columns` is `None` before attempting to access its length.

### Corrected Function:
```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:  # Check for None before accessing length
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

By adding the check `if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0`, we ensure that the code only attempts to access the length of `self.columns` if it is not `None`. This modification addresses the bug reported in the GitHub issue and ensures that the function can handle cases where `columns` are set to `None`.
