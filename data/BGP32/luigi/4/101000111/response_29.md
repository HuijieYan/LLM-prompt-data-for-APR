## Analysis:
1. The buggy function `copy` within the `S3CopyToTable` class is responsible for copying data from S3 into Redshift. It constructs a SQL query to execute a `COPY` command based on input parameters.
2. The bug seems to be related to the handling of the `self.columns` attribute when it is `None`.
3. The GitHub issue mentions that when `columns` are `None`, the code fails with a `TypeError` due to `object of type 'NoneType'` having no `len()`. The bug occurs at the line checking the length of `self.columns`.
4. To fix the bug, we need to check if `self.columns` is not `None` before trying to access its length. If it is `None`, we should handle it gracefully to avoid the error.

## Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Update the line `if len(self.columns) > 0:` to `if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:` to ensure that if `self.columns` is `None`, it won't throw an error.
2. Additionally, it's essential to handle the case where `self.columns` is `None` and adjust the SQL query construction accordingly.

## Corrected Version of the Function:

```python
    def copy(self, cursor, f):
        """
        Defines copying from S3 into Redshift.
        
        If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
        """
        logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
        colnames = ''
        if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:
            colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
            colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

        if self.columns:
            colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
            colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

        cursor.execute("""
         COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
         CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
         {options}
         ;""".format(
            table=self.table,
            colnames=colnames,
            source=f,
            creds=self._credentials(),
            options=self.copy_options())
        )
```

The corrected version includes the necessary check for `self.columns` before accessing its length and adjusts the SQL query construction accordingly. This fix should address the bug reported in the GitHub issue for failing Redshift `COPY` jobs.
