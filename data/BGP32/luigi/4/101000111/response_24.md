## Analysis
1. The buggy function `copy` is supposed to execute a `COPY` command in Redshift. It is taking parameters such as cursor, f (source file), and self attributes like columns, table, and copy_options.
2. The bug seems to be in the line `if len(self.columns) > 0`. If `self.columns` is `None`, then `len(None)` operation will raise an exception.
3. The GitHub issue suggests that the bug occurs when `columns=None`. The proposed solution is to check `if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0` to avoid the exception.
4. The strategy to fix the bug is to modify the condition checking for columns before getting its length to prevent the `NoneType` error.

## Bug Fix
```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options())
    )
```

By modifying the condition to `if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0`, we prevent the `NoneType` error when `self.columns` is `None`. Additionally, we need to call `self.copy_options()` to correctly retrieve the copy options.
