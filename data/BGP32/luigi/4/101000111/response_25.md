## Analysis:
1. The buggy function `copy` is responsible for inserting a file into Redshift from an S3 bucket.
2. The bug occurs when `self.columns` is None, causing an error when trying to get the length of None.
3. The GitHub issue highlights this bug when running Redshift COPY jobs with `columns = None`, resulting in a TypeError.
4. To fix the bug, we need to check if `self.columns` is not None before trying to get its length.

## Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Update the condition for checking the length of `self.columns` to also verify if `self.columns` is not None.
2. Handle the case where `self.columns` is None appropriately to prevent the TypeError.
3. Ensure that the function can handle the scenario where no columns are provided.

## Corrected Version:
```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from S3 into Redshift.
    
    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)
    
    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

With this correction, the function will now properly handle the scenario where `self.columns` is None, as pointed out in the GitHub issue.
