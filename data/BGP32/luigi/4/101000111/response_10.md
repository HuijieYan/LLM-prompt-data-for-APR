## Analysis:
1. The buggy function `copy` in the `S3CopyToTable` class within the `redshift.py` file is failing due to an issue related to handling the `self.columns` variable.
2. The function is trying to construct the `colnames` variable by joining the columns if they exist in `self.columns`, but it is crashing when `self.columns` is `None`.
3. The GitHub issue confirms that the bug occurs when `columns = None`, causing a `TypeError` due to trying to get the length of `None`.
4. The suggested fix is to check if `self.columns` is not None and then proceed with getting its length, which will prevent the `TypeError`.

## Bug Fix Strategy:
To address the bug in the `copy` function, we will add a conditional check to ensure that `self.columns` is not `None` before proceeding with getting its length.

## Bug Fix in Python code:
```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:  # Check if self.columns is not None
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options())
    )
```

By adding the check `if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0`, we ensure that the `colnames` variable is constructed only when `self.columns` is not `None`. This modification addresses the bug reported in the GitHub issue and ensures that the function works correctly with or without columns provided.
