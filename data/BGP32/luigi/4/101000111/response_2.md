## Analysis
1. The buggy function `copy` is responsible for copying data from S3 to Redshift. It constructs a query using the provided parameters but has an issue when dealing with the `self.columns` attribute.
2. The bug seems to be related to the condition `if len(self.columns) > 0:` which causes an error if `self.columns` is `None`.
3. The bug arises from attempting to access the length of `self.columns` without checking if it is `None`. This leads to a `TypeError` when trying to take the length of a `NoneType`.
4. To fix the bug, we need to first check if `self.columns` is not `None` before trying to get its length.

## Bug Fix
```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options())
    )
```

I have added a check `if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:` before trying to access the length of `self.columns`. This ensures that the function won't try to get the length of `None` and avoids the `TypeError` mentioned in the GitHub issue.
