## Analysis
The buggy function `copy` in the `S3CopyToTable` class is failing when `self.columns` is `None`. The issue arises from the code trying to determine the length of `self.columns` without checking if it is `None` first. This results in a `TypeError` when trying to operate on a `NoneType` object.

The provided GitHub issue suggests a fix by explicitly checking if `self.columns` is not `None` before trying to get its length. This will prevent the `TypeError` when `self.columns` is `None`.

## Bug Fix Strategy
1. Check if `self.columns` is not `None` before trying to get its length.
2. If `self.columns` is not `None`, proceed with determining `colnames` as before.
3. Update the `cursor.execute` call to include the correct value for `colnames`.
4. Implement the suggested fix from the GitHub issue to handle the case when `self.columns` is `None`.

## Corrected Version
```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns is not None:  # Check if self.columns is not None
        if len(self.columns) > 0:
            colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
            colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

With this correction, the function checks if `self.columns` is not `None` before attempting to get its length. This change prevents the `TypeError` when `self.columns` is `None`. Additionally, the `cursor.execute` call now includes the correct value for `colnames` based on whether `self.columns` is `None` or not.
