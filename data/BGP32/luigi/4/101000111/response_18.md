### Analyzing the buggy function
The buggy function `copy` within the `S3CopyToTable` class in `luigi/contrib/redshift.py` is responsible for defining the copying process from an S3 source into Redshift. The issue arises when `self.columns` is set to `None`, causing a `TypeError` due to trying to get the length of a `NoneType`.

### Identified error location
The main error in the buggy function lies in the following lines:
```python
colnames = ''
if len(self.columns) > 0:
    colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
    colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)
```

### Cause of the bug
The bug is triggered when `self.columns` is `None`, as per the GitHub issue mentioned. The code checks if the length of `self.columns` is greater than zero without taking into account the possibility of `self.columns` being `None`. This leads to an exception when trying to get the length of `None`.

### Strategy for fixing the bug
To fix the bug and address the issue raised on GitHub, we should check if `self.columns` is not `None` before attempting to calculate the length. If `self.columns` is not `None`, then we can proceed with the rest of the logic.

### Corrected version of the function
```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:  # Check if self.columns is not None before getting its length
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

By making this simple adjustment to check if `self.columns` is not `None` before trying to get its length, the bug is fixed. This modification ensures that the function does not encounter a `TypeError` when `self.columns` is `None`.
