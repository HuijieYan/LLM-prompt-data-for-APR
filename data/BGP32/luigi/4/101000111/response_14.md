## Analysis:
1. The buggy function `copy` in the class `S3CopyToTable` fails to properly handle the case where `self.columns` is `None`. This results in a `TypeError` when trying to get the length of `self.columns`.
2. The GitHub issue highlights the problem and suggests a solution to check if `self.columns` exists and then proceed with checking its length.
3. The current code doesn't handle the scenario where `self.columns` is `None`, leading to a `TypeError` due to trying to get the length of `None`.
4. The suggested strategy for fixing the bug is to modify the code to first check if `self.columns` exists before trying to get its length.

## Corrected Version:

```python
class S3CopyToTable(rdbms.CopyToTable, _CredentialsMixin):
    
    def copy_options(self):
        # Please ignore the body of this function

    def copy(self, cursor, f):
        """
        Defines copying from s3 into redshift.
        
        If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
        """
        logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
        colnames = ''
        if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0: # Check if self.columns is not None before getting its length
            colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
            colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)
        
        cursor.execute("""
         COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
         CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
         {options}
         ;""".format(
            table=self.table,
            colnames=colnames,
            source=f,
            creds=self._credentials(),
            options=self.copy_options)
        )
```

By adding the check `if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0`, we ensure that the code will only try to get the length of `self.columns` if it exists, thus avoiding the `TypeError` when `self.columns` is `None`. This corrected version should address the bug reported in the GitHub issue and handle the scenario where `self.columns` is not provided correctly.
