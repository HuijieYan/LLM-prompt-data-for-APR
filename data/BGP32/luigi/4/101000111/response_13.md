## Analysis
The `copy` function is failing due to a bug in checking the length of `self.columns` without verifying if it is `None` or not. This bug leads to a `TypeError` when `self.columns` is `None`. The fix should include checking if `self.columns` is not `None` before attempting to get its length.

## Bug
The bug in the code occurs when trying to get the length of `self.columns` without checking if it is `None` or not. This leads to a `TypeError` when `self.columns` is `None`.

## Fix
To fix the bug, we need to check if `self.columns` is not `None` before trying to get its length. This will prevent the `TypeError` from occurring.

## Corrected Version
```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns is not None and len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options())
    )
``` 

In the corrected version, we have added a check `if self.columns is not None` before attempting to get the length of `self.columns`. This change will prevent the `TypeError` from occurring when `self.columns` is `None`.
