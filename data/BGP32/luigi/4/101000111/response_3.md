Based on the provided information, the bug in the function is related to the handling of the `self.columns` attribute when it is set to `None`. The buggy code tries to retrieve the length of `self.columns` without checking if it is `None` or not, leading to a `TypeError` when attempting to use it in the `if` condition to construct `colnames`.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the condition checking for the existence and non-emptiness of `self.columns` before trying to construct `colnames`.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    
    if self.columns:  # Check if self.columns is not None
        if len(self.columns) > 0:
            colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
            colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options())
    )
```

In the corrected version:
- We added a check `if self.columns:` before checking the length of `self.columns` to prevent the `TypeError` when `self.columns` is `None`.
- We modified the call to `self.copy_options` by adding `()` to correctly call the method.

These changes will ensure that the function behaves as expected, resolving the bug described in the GitHub issue.
