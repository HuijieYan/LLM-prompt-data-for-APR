### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `copy` is responsible for executing a `COPY` statement from an S3 source into a Redshift table. It constructs the query dynamically based on parameters like table name, columns, source file, credentials, and copy options.

2. The bug occurs when constructing the `colnames` string from the column names provided. If no columns are provided (`self.columns` is empty), the `colnames` string remains empty.

3. The bug is triggered when the buggy function tries to pass `self.copy_options` (which is a function) directly in the formatted SQL query string. This can result in unexpected behavior as it should be a function call.

4. To fix the bug, we need to correctly call the `self.copy_options()` function to retrieve the actual copy options string. Additionally, we should address the suggestion from the GitHub issue to handle the case where no columns are provided.

### Updated/Copy function code:

```python
    def copy(self, cursor, f):
        """
        Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

        If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
        """
        logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)

        colnames = '' if not self.columns else ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])

        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames) if colnames else ''

        cursor.execute("""
         COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
         CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
         {options}
         ;""".format(
            table=self.table,
            colnames=colnames,
            source=f,
            creds=self._credentials(),
            options=self.copy_options()
        )
        )
```

### Explanation:
1. Updated the construction of `colnames` to handle the case where no columns are provided.
2. Corrected the call to `self.copy_options()` to retrieve the actual copy options string.
3. Implemented the suggested change to check if `self.columns` is not empty before constructing `colnames`.

By applying these fixes, the function should now handle the case where columns are not provided and correctly construct the `COPY` query.
