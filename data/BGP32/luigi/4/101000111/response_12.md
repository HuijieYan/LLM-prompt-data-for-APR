## Analysis:
1. The buggy function `copy` is failing due to the `self.columns` attribute not being checked for `None` before checking its length.
2. The GitHub issue explains that passing `None` for columns to prohibit table creation causes the bug.
3. The bug occurs because the code does not check if `self.columns` is `None` before attempting to get its length, resulting in a `TypeError` when `self.columns` is `None`.
4. To fix the bug, we need to modify the code to check if `self.columns` is not `None` before accessing its length.

## Correction:
```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:  # Fix: Added check for None
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

By adding a check for `self.columns` not being `None`, we ensure that the code only attempts to get the length of `self.columns` when it is not `None`, preventing the `TypeError` raised when `self.columns` is `None`.
