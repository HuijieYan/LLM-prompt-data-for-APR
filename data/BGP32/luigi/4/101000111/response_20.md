### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `copy` within the `S3CopyToTable` class is supposed to define copying data from S3 into a Redshift table. It constructs a SQL query using various attributes of the class.
2. The bug seems to be related to the condition for creating the `colnames` variable. If `self.columns` is not provided (None), it results in an error due to calling `len()` on a NoneType object.
3. The GitHub issue indicates that this bug occurs when `self.columns` is None, and the fix suggested is to check for `self.columns` before trying to calculate its length.
4. The strategy for fixing the bug is to add a condition to check if `self.columns` is not None before trying to construct the `colnames` variable.
5. The corrected version of the function is provided below:

### Corrected Version:
```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from S3 into Redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:  # Check if self.columns is not None before proceeding
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

By adding the `if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:` condition, we ensure that `colnames` is only constructed when `self.columns` is not None and has a length greater than 0, thus fixing the bug addressed in the GitHub issue.
