### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `copy` is trying to execute a `COPY` command in Redshift with provided parameters. It is building the query string using string formatting but not executing it correctly.
2. The bug seems to be related to how `self.copy_options` is being used without calling the method `copy_options()` in the query string.
3. The bug causes the `COPY` command to fail when columns are not provided, resulting in a `TypeError`. The proposed solution in the GitHub issue suggests checking for `self.columns` before accessing its length to avoid this issue.
4. To fix the bug, we need to call the `copy_options()` method to get the correct options string and add a check for `self.columns` before constructing `colnames` in the query.

### Bug Fix:
```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:  # Fix the bug by checking self.columns
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options())  # Call the method to get copy options
    )
```

By making these changes, the function should now correctly handle cases where `self.columns` is `None` and avoid the `TypeError` mentioned in the GitHub issue.
