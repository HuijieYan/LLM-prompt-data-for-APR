## Analysis
1. The buggy function `copy` in the `S3CopyToTable` class is responsible for executing a COPY command in Redshift. It constructs the SQL query dynamically using various parameters like `table`, `columns`, `source`, `creds`, and `options`.
2. The bug is caused by `colnames` being empty when `self.columns` is not provided, leading to a malformed SQL query.
3. The GitHub issue points out that the bug occurs when `columns` are not provided, resulting in a `TypeError` due to `len(None)`. The suggested solution is to check `if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0` to prevent the error.
4. To fix the bug, we need to check if `self.columns` is not None before constructing `colnames` to avoid the `TypeError`.

## Corrected Version
```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: luigi/contrib/redshift.py

class S3CopyToTable(rdbms.CopyToTable, _CredentialsMixin):
    def copy_options(self):
        # Please ignore the body of this function

    def copy(self, cursor, f):
        """
        Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

        If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
        """
        logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
        colnames = ''
        if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:  # Check if self.columns is not None
            colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
            colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

        cursor.execute("""
         COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
         CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
         {options}
         ;""".format(
            table=self.table,
            colnames=colnames,
            source=f,
            creds=self._credentials(),
            options=self.copy_options())
        )
```

In the corrected version, I have added a check `if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0` before constructing `colnames`. This check ensures that `colnames` will only be constructed if `self.columns` is not None, preventing the `TypeError` mentioned in the GitHub issue.
