## Analysis:
1. The buggy function `copy` within the `S3CopyToTable` class is responsible for copying data from S3 to Redshift.
2. The bug occurs due to the condition checking the length of `self.columns` before creating the `colnames` string.
3. The bug causes the `colnames` variable to be left empty even if `self.columns` is not empty, leading to incorrect SQL query generation.
4. To fix the bug, we need to modify the condition to check if `self.columns` is not None before proceeding with creating the `colnames` string.

## Correction:
```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = '' 
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options())
    )
```

In the corrected version, we added a check `if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:` to ensure that `colnames` is only built if `self.columns` is not None and has a length greater than 0. This change addresses the bug and aligns with the expected behavior outlined in the GitHub issue.
