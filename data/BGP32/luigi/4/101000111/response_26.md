### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `copy` is responsible for executing a `COPY` command in Redshift with certain parameters.
2. The bug seems to be related to the condition `if len(self.columns) > 0:` when `self.columns` is `None`.
3. The GitHub issue suggests that when `columns` are set to `None`, a `TypeError` occurs due to trying to get the length of `None`.
4. The proposed solution is to change the condition to `if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:` to avoid the error.

### Bug Cause:
The bug occurs because the buggy function does not handle the case where `self.columns` is `None`. When `self.columns` is `None`, it should skip the logic related to fetching column names.

### Fix Strategy:
1. Check if `self.columns` is not `None` before trying to access its length.
2. If `self.columns` is not `None`, proceed with fetching column names and constructing the query; otherwise, skip the column-related logic.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

In the corrected version, we added a check for `self.columns` before accessing its length. This change ensures that the buggy function can handle cases where `self.columns` is `None` without causing a `TypeError`.
