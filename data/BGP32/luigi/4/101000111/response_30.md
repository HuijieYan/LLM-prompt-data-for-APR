### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `copy` is intended to copy data from S3 into Redshift.
2. The bug arises from the condition checking `len(self.columns) > 0` without properly handling cases where `self.columns` is `None`.
3. The GitHub issue highlights that running Redshift COPY jobs with `columns = None` to prohibit table creation fails due to this specific issue.
4. The suggested fix in the GitHub issue proposes changing the condition to `if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:` to handle the case where `self.columns` is `None`.

### Bug cause:
The bug occurs because the code does not handle the case where `self.columns` is `None`. When `self.columns` is `None`, trying to access its length using `len(self.columns)` leads to a `TypeError` as `NoneType` does not have a length attribute.

### Strategy for fixing the bug:
1. Modify the condition to ensure that it first checks if `self.columns` is not `None` before attempting to access its length.
2. If `self.columns` is `None`, then set `colnames` to an empty string without trying to extract column names.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    
    if self.columns is not None:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

This corrected version checks if `self.columns` is not `None` before attempting to extract column names. It handles the case where `self.columns` is `None`, as suggested in the GitHub issue, thereby resolving the bug where Redshift COPY fails when columns are not provided.
