## Analysis:
The buggy function `copy()` in the `S3CopyToTable` class is trying to execute a Redshift COPY command with certain parameters. The issue arises when `self.columns` is None, leading to a `TypeError` during the execution due to trying to determine the length of a NoneType object.

The GitHub issue identifies the root cause linked to a specific commit in the codebase where the check for `self.columns` is not done properly, causing the bug.

## Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the check for the existence and non-emptiness of `self.columns` is correctly done before attempting to use it in the variable `colnames`.

## Corrected Version:
```python
class S3CopyToTable(rdbms.CopyToTable, _CredentialsMixin):

    def copy_options(self):
        # Please ignore the body of this function

    def copy(self, cursor, f):
        """
        Defines copying from s3 into redshift.
    
        If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
        """
        logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
        colnames = ''
        if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:
            colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
            colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)
    
        cursor.execute("""
         COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
         CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
         {options}
         ;""".format(
            table=self.table,
            colnames=colnames,
            source=f,
            creds=self._credentials(),
            options=self.copy_options)
        )
```

In this corrected version, the `if` condition is updated to correctly check if `self.columns` exists and is not empty before processing it. This change should resolve the bug mentioned in the GitHub issue by preventing the `TypeError` that occurs when `self.columns` is None.
