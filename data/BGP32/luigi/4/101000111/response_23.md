### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `copy` within the `S3CopyToTable` class in `luigi/contrib/redshift.py` is expected to copy data from S3 into Redshift. The bug seems to be related to how it handles the absence of columns while executing the `COPY` command.
2. The code checks if there are columns defined, and if so, constructs the `colnames` string accordingly. If no columns are provided, the `colnames` string remains empty, which is expected behavior.
3. The bug seems to occur when the `cursor.execute` call is made within the `copy` function. The issue arises when trying to access `self.columns` without ensuring it's not `None`.
4. To fix the bug, we need to modify the conditional check for the presence of `self.columns` before proceeding with its processing.
5. Below is the corrected version of the `copy` function:

### Corrected Version:
```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from S3 into Redshift.
    
    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options())
    )
```

### Explanation:
- The corrected version now includes a check `if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0` before processing `self.columns`. This prevents the TypeError that occurred when `self.columns` was `None`.
- By ensuring that `self.columns` is not `None`, we avoid the issue highlighted in the GitHub report related to COPY jobs failing when there are no columns provided.

By applying this fix, the `COPY` operation in Redshift should now work correctly even when `self.columns` are not explicitly defined.
