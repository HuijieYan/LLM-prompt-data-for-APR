### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `copy` is meant to perform a Redshift COPY operation from an S3 source. It constructs a SQL query using the provided parameters like table name, column names, source file, credentials, and copy options.
2. The bug seems to be related to the handling of the `self.columns` attribute. If no columns are provided (`len(self.columns) == 0`), the code tries to join the columns which leads to an error due to NoneType.
3. The bug causes the function to crash with a `TypeError: object of type 'NoneType' has no len()`. This is in line with the GitHub issue mentioned, which highlights the problem when no columns are provided.
4. To fix the bug, we need to check if `self.columns` is not None before trying to concatenate it in the SQL query.
5. The corrected version of the function is provided below:

### Corrected Version:
```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from S3 into Redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options())
    )
``` 

In the corrected version:
- We added a check `if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0`, ensuring that `self.columns` is not None before manipulating it.
- We also corrected the `self.copy_options` call by using `self.copy_options()` to ensure it's a function call.
- This fix addresses the bug identified in the GitHub issue and should prevent the `TypeError` when no columns are provided.
