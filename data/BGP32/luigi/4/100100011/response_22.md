### Analysis:
1. The `copy` function in `luigi/contrib/redshift.py` is intended to copy data from S3 into Redshift.
2. The bug occurs when the `columns` parameter is `None`, leading to a `TypeError`.
3. The failing test in `test/contrib/redshift_test.py` attempts to test the behavior when `columns` is `None`.
4. The GitHub issue indicates that the bug was introduced in a specific commit and proposes a possible solution by checking `if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0`.

### Bug Cause:
The bug occurs in the `copy` function when `self.columns` is `None`. The current implementation does not handle this scenario, leading to a `TypeError` when trying to get the length of `None`.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we should modify the logic to check if `self.columns` is not `None` before trying to access its length. This approach will prevent the `TypeError` when `self.columns` is `None`.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from S3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:  # Fix: Check if self.columns is not None
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

By adding the check `if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0`, we ensure that the code only tries to access the length of `self.columns` if it is not `None`. This correction should address the bug and allow the function to handle cases where `columns` is `None` as in the failing test scenario.
