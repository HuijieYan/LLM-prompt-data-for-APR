### Analysis:
The buggy function `copy` in `luigi/contrib/redshift.py` is failing due to the `len` function being called on `self.columns` without checking if `self.columns` is `None`.

### Error Locations:
1. The line `if len(self.columns) > 0:` is assuming that `self.columns` is not `None`, leading to a `TypeError` when `self.columns` is `None`.

### Cause of the Bug:
The bug is causing a `TypeError` when `self.columns` is `None` because the length of `None` cannot be determined.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to check if `self.columns` is not `None` before trying to get its length using the `len` function.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns is not None and len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

By adding a check to ensure `self.columns` is not `None` before trying to get its length, we prevent the `TypeError` from occurring. This corrected version should now pass the failing test and resolve the GitHub issue.
