### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `copy` in `luigi/contrib/redshift.py` is supposed to define copying from S3 into Redshift but fails when `self.columns` is `None`.
2. The failing test `test_s3_copy_with_nonetype_columns` in `test/contrib/redshift_test.py` is mocking the behavior to test the `copy` function with `columns=None`.
3. The GitHub issue describes the problem where a `TypeError` occurs due to `NoneType` having no length, suggesting a solution to check for `self.columns` before checking its length.

### Bug Explanation:
The bug occurs because the function attempts to compute `len(self.columns)` without first checking if `self.columns` has been provided or is `None`. This causes a `TypeError` when trying to get the length of `None`.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we should modify the code to check if `self.columns` is not `None` before trying to calculate its length. This will prevent the `TypeError` when `columns` is `None`.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from S3 into Redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:  # Check if columns are provided and not None
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

By adding the check `if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0`, we ensure that `self.columns` is not `None` before trying to calculate its length, fixing the bug identified in the failing test and GitHub issue.
