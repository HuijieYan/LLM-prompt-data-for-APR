Based on the analysis provided, the bug in the `copy` function is caused when attempting to retrieve the length of `self.columns` without handling the case when it is `None`. This bug results in a `TypeError: object of type 'NoneType' has no len()` when `self.columns` is `None`.

To fix this bug, we can add a check to ensure that `self.columns` is not `None` before attempting to access its length. Here is the corrected version of the `copy` function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

By adding the check `if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:`, we ensure that the length of `self.columns` is only accessed when it is not `None`, fixing the bug identified in the failing test case and the GitHub issue. This corrected version of the `copy` function should now pass the failing test case and resolve the issue reported in GitHub.
