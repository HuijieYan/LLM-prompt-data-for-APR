## Analysis:
The buggy function `copy` in the `luigi/contrib/redshift.py` file is failing when `self.columns` is set to `None` due to the `TypeError: object of type 'NoneType' has no len()` error. The failing test `test_s3_copy_with_nonetype_columns` in `test/contrib/redshift_test.py` mocks the behavior, leading to the discovered bug.

## Error Location:
The potential error location within the buggy function `copy` is the check for the length of `self.columns`. When `self.columns` is `None`, the code tries to call `len()` on it, resulting in a `TypeError`.

## Cause of the Bug:
The root cause of the bug is the incorrect handling of `self.columns`. When `columns=None`, the code does not properly check whether `self.columns` is not `None` before attempting to get its length. This causes the `TypeError` to be raised.

## Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, the function needs to check if `self.columns` is not `None` before trying to get its length. By adding a condition to check for `None` before calling `len(self.columns)`, the bug can be resolved.

## Corrected Version:
```python
# Defining the corrected version of the buggy function
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:  # Check if self.columns is not None
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

By modifying the condition `if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0`, we ensure that `self.columns` is not `None` before trying to get its length, thus preventing the `TypeError` from occurring. This corrected version should pass the failing test and resolve the GitHub issue related to Redshift COPY failures in Luigi 2.7.1 when columns are not provided.
