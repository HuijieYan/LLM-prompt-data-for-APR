The bug in the provided function `copy` is caused by accessing the `self.columns` attribute without checking if it is `None`. This results in a `TypeError: object of type 'NoneType' has no len()` when trying to get the length of `self.columns`.

To fix this bug, we need to add a check for `self.columns` being `None` before performing any operations on it.

Here is the corrected version of the `copy` function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

By adding the `if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:` check, we ensure that the code only tries to access the length of `self.columns` when it is not `None`. This correction addresses the root cause of the bug mentioned in the GitHub issue and should now pass the failing test provided.
