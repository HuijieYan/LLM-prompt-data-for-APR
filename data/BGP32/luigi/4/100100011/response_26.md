The issue is related to the `copy` function in the `luigi/contrib/redshift.py` file. The problem arises when the `columns` attribute is set to `None`, causing a `TypeError` due to `len(None)`. The GitHub issue points out that the bug was introduced in version 2.7.1 of Luigi and suggests a solution to handle the case when `self.columns` is `None`.

To fix this bug, we need to add a check for `self.columns` being `None` before trying to get the length of `self.columns`. If `self.columns` is `None`, we should set `colnames` as an empty string without trying to get the column names.

Here is the corrected version of the `copy` function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns is not None:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

By checking for `self.columns` being `None`, we prevent the `TypeError` when trying to get the length of `None`. This corrected version should pass the failing test and resolve the issue reported on GitHub.
