## Analyzing the bug:
The buggy function `copy` in `redshift.py` is causing an issue when the `columns` parameter is set to `None`, leading to a `TypeError: object of type 'NoneType' has no len()`. The failing test in `redshift_test.py` specifically tests this scenario by passing `columns=None` to `DummyS3CopyToTableKey` task.

## Potential error locations:
The bug likely occurs when trying to get the length of `self.columns` without first checking if it is `None`.

## Cause of the bug:
The bug occurs due to the assumption that `self.columns` will always have a value before trying to check its length. When `columns` is set to `None`, it causes the `TypeError`.

## Strategy for fixing the bug:
To fix the bug, we should first check if `self.columns` is not `None` before trying to access its length. This will prevent the `TypeError` when `columns` is set to `None`.

## Corrected version of the function:
```python
# Corrected version of the copy function
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

By adding the check `if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:`, we ensure that `self.columns` is not `None` before trying to access its length. This correction should resolve the `TypeError` issue when `columns` is set to `None`.
