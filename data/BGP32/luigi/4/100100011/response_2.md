## Analysis:
The buggy function `copy` in `luigi/contrib/redshift.py` is failing to handle cases where `self.columns` is None, causing a `TypeError` due to trying to get the length of a None type object.

The failing test `test_s3_copy_with_nonetype_columns` in `test/contrib/redshift_test.py` calls the `copy` function with `columns=None` parameter, triggering the bug.

The GitHub issue highlights the bug where Redshift COPY jobs fail when columns are not provided, leading to a `TypeError` due to calling `len` on a NoneType object.

## Bug Cause:
The buggy function does not check if `self.columns` is None before trying to get its length, leading to a `TypeError` when `columns=None` is passed. This issue is due to an assumption that `self.columns` will always have a value, which is not true in all cases.

## Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to check if `self.columns` is not None before trying to get its length. This check will prevent the `TypeError` when `columns=None` is passed. By adding a condition to check for `self.columns` existence before accessing its length, we can ensure the function handles both cases correctly.

## Corrected Version:
```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

With this corrected version, the `copy` function will first check if `self.columns` is not None before proceeding to get its length, avoiding the `TypeError` when `columns=None` is provided. This fix addresses the bug reported in the GitHub issue and ensures the function behaves as intended.
