### Analysis:
1. The buggy function is the `copy` function within the `RedshiftTarget` class in the `luigi/contrib/redshift.py` file.
2. The failing test is checking the behavior when `columns` is `None` and making assertions on the SQL query generated by the `copy` function.
3. The GitHub issue indicates that the bug occurs because the `copy` function assumes `self.columns` will always be a list and tries to get its length, resulting in a `TypeError` when `self.columns` is `None`.
4. The suggested fix is to check if `self.columns` is not `None` before getting its length.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to modify the code to first check if `self.columns` is not `None` before trying to get its length to avoid the `TypeError`. This fix will ensure that the `copy` function can handle the case when `columns` is `None`.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

By adding the check `if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0`, we ensure that `self.columns` is not `None` before trying to get its length, thus preventing the `TypeError` when `columns` is `None`. This corrected version should address the issue reported in the GitHub bug and pass the failing test.
