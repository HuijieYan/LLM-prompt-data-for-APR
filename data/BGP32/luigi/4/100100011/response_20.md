## Analysis:
- The buggy function `copy` in `luigi/contrib/redshift.py` is attempting to process a COPY command to copy data from S3 into Redshift.
- The issue reported on GitHub states that when `columns` are not provided (set to `None`), a `TypeError` occurs due to calling `len(None)`.
- The buggy function is trying to generate the column names from `self.columns` which is causing the issue when it is `None`.

## Potential Error Locations:
1. The line `if len(self.columns) > 0:` is problematic when `self.columns` is `None`.
2. The way the column names retrieval and formatting is handled can lead to errors.

## Cause of the Bug:
The bug is caused by referencing `len(self.columns)` directly without checking if `self.columns` is `None`. When `columns=None` is passed, it results in `TypeError: object of type 'NoneType' has no len()`.

## Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we should check if `self.columns` is not `None` before trying to calculate its length. Additionally, handling the situation when `self.columns` is `None` should be done to prevent the error.

## Corrected Version:
```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

By adding the check `if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:`, we ensure that `self.columns` is not `None` before trying to calculate its length. This fix should resolve the `TypeError` issue when `columns=None`, as reported in the GitHub issue.
