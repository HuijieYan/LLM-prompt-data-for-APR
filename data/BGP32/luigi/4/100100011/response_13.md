### Analysis:
- The `copy` function in the `redshift.py` file is supposed to define copying from S3 into Redshift.
- The failing test `test_s3_copy_with_nonetype_columns` in `redshift_test.py` is trying to test the behavior when `columns` is set to `None`.
- The GitHub issue highlights that the bug occurs when `columns` is set to `None`, leading to a `TypeError: object of type 'NoneType' has no len()`.

### Bug Location:
- The issue arises due to the condition check `if len(self.columns) > 0` assuming `self.columns` is not `None`.
- When `self.columns` is `None`, the length check throws a `TypeError`.

### Bug Cause:
- The buggy function does not correctly handle the case when `columns` is set to `None`, causing the bug described in the GitHub issue.
- The bug occurs because `self.columns` is not checked for `None` before accessing its length.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
- Check if `self.columns` is not `None` before trying to access its length to avoid the `TypeError`.
- Update the condition to `if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0` to address the issue effectively.

### Corrected Version:
```python
# Fixing the buggy function in redshift.py
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from S3 into Redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

After applying this fix, the `copy` function should now handle the case when `columns` is set to `None` without causing any `TypeError`, resolving the issue reported in the GitHub bug.
