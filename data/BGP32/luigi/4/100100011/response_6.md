### Analysis:
The buggy function `copy` in `luigi/contrib/redshift.py` is failing due to the `columns` parameter being `None`. The issue is described in the GitHub issue as well, where the `TypeError: object of type 'NoneType' has no len()` error occurs when `self.columns` is `None`.

### Identified Error:
The error in the buggy function occurs when trying to check the length of `self.columns` without handling the case where `self.columns` is `None`.

### Explanation:
The bug occurs because the buggy function assumes that `self.columns` will always have a value, leading to the `TypeError` when trying to check its length when it is `None`. The test `test_s3_copy_with_nonetype_columns` in `redshift_test.py` specifically tests this scenario where `columns` is set to `None` and expects the `copy` function to handle it properly.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to handle the case where `self.columns` is `None` by checking if it has a value before trying to get its length in the `copy` function.

### Corrected Version:
Here is the corrected version of the `copy` function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

With this correction, the `copy` function will check if `self.columns` has a value before trying to access its length. This will prevent the `TypeError` when `columns` is `None`, resolving the issue reported in the GitHub bug report.
