Based on the provided information, the bug in the `copy` function of `luigi.contrib.redshift.py` arises from the case when `self.columns` is None, causing a `TypeError` when trying to check its length. To fix this bug, we need to modify the condition `if len(self.columns) > 0` to correctly handle the case when `self.columns` is None.

Here is the corrected version of the `copy` function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

Explanation:
- We added a check `if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0` to ensure that `self.columns` is not None before attempting to get its length.
- This modification prevents the `TypeError` that was occurring when `self.columns` was None.

By applying this fix, the `copy` function should now be able to handle cases where `self.columns` is None, as reported in the GitHub issue.
