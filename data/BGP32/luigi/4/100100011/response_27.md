### Bug Analysis:
- The bug in the `copy` function is related to the handling of columns when they are set to `None`.
- The failing test `test_s3_copy_with_nonetype_columns` is trying to create a `RedshiftTarget` with `columns=None` and then call the `copy` function with a mocked cursor. This results in a `TypeError` due to the attempt to get the length of `None`.
- The provided GitHub issue highlights that the bug occurs when `columns=None` is used, and suggests changing the condition in the code to ensure it handles this case correctly.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
- Modify the condition checking for `self.columns` to ensure it is not `None` before attempting to get its length.
- Update the function to handle the case where `self.columns` is `None` by checking if it is not `None` before getting its length.

### Corrected Version of the `copy` function:
```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

By updating the `copy` function with the corrected condition `if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0`, the bug related to handling `None` columns should be fixed. This change aligns with the suggestion provided in the GitHub issue.
