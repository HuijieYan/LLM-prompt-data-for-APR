Based on the information provided, the bug in the `copy` function stems from the condition `if len(self.columns) > 0:` which throws an error when `self.columns` is None. This bug causes the Redshift COPY operation to fail when `columns` is not provided.

To fix this bug, the condition should be updated to `if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:` to first check if `self.columns` is not None before attempting to get its length.

Here is the corrected version of the `copy` function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

By making this change, the bug should be fixed and the `copy` function should now work as expected, passing the failing test related to Redshift COPY jobs in Luigi 2.7.1 when columns are not provided.
