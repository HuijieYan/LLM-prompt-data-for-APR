## Analysis:
The buggy function `copy` in the file `luigi/contrib/redshift.py` is failing when the `columns` attribute is set to `None`. The function is attempting to access the length of `self.columns`, which results in a `TypeError` when `self.columns` is `None`.

The failing test `test_s3_copy_with_nonetype_columns` in the file `test/contrib/redshift_test.py` demonstrates this issue by mocking the scenario where `columns` is `None` and calling the `copy` function. The test expects the `copy` function to execute a `COPY` statement with an empty `colnames`.

The GitHub issue titled "Redshift COPY fails in luigi 2.7.1 when columns are not provided" provides context on the problem and suggests a possible solution by checking if `self.columns` is not `None` before attempting to access its length.

## Error Location:
The error is occurring at the following line in the `copy` function:
```python
if len(self.columns) > 0:
```

## Cause of the Bug:
The bug is caused by the function trying to access the length of `self.columns` when `self.columns` is `None`, leading to a `TypeError`. This behavior is in line with the failing test and the information from the GitHub issue, which states that providing `None` for `columns` should result in an empty `colnames`.

## Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we should modify the condition to first check if `self.columns` is not `None` before checking its length. This will prevent the `TypeError` when `columns` is explicitly set to `None`.

## Corrected Version of the Function:
Here is the corrected version of the `copy` function:
```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:  # Check if self.columns is not None
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

By adding the check `if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:`, we ensure that the `columns` are only processed if they are not `None`, resolving the `TypeError` when `columns` is set to `None`.
