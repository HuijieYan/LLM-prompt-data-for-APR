## Analysis:
The buggy function `copy` in `luigi/contrib/redshift.py` is failing when `columns=None` is passed. The issue is reported in GitHub and the proposed solution suggests changing the condition to `if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0`.

## Identified Issue:
The issue occurs due to the `if len(self.columns) > 0:` line in the `copy` function where it directly checks the length of `self.columns` without validating if `self.columns` is `None`.

## Cause of the Bug:
When `columns=None` is passed to the `copy` function, it tries to get the length of `self.columns`, which is `None`, resulting in a `TypeError: object of type 'NoneType' has no len()`.

## Fix Strategy:
Modify the condition in the `copy` function to handle the case where `self.columns` is `None` to prevent the `TypeError` and allow the function to execute smoothly.

## Corrected Version:
```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.
    
    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

By updating the `if` condition to `if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0`, the corrected version of the `copy` function should now handle the case where `columns=None` without raising a `TypeError`.
