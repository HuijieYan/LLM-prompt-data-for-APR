## Analysis:
1. The buggy function `copy` in `luigi/contrib/redshift.py` is trying to execute a `COPY` command in Redshift.
2. The test function in `test/contrib/redshift_test.py` is testing the behavior of the `copy` function when `columns` are set to `None`.
3. The `GitHub` issue highlights that the bug occurs in `luigi 2.7.1` when `columns` are set to `None`, resulting in a `TypeError`.
4. The cause of the bug is the assumption that `self.columns` will always have a length, leading to the error.

## Bug Fix Strategy:
- Update the condition for determining `colnames` to handle the case when `self.columns` is `None`.
- Check if `self.columns` is not `None` before trying to get its length.

## Corrected Version of the `copy` function:
```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

By updating the condition to check if `self.columns` is not `None`, the corrected version of the `copy` function will now handle the case when `columns` are set to `None` and avoid the `TypeError` mentioned in the GitHub issue.
