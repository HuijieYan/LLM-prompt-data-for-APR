## Analysis:
The buggy function `copy` in `luigi/contrib/redshift.py` is causing an issue when the `columns` parameter is set to `None`. The failing test `test_s3_copy_with_nonetype_columns` in `test/contrib/redshift_test.py` is trying to test the behavior when `columns` is `None`, but it leads to a `TypeError` due to trying to calculate the length of a `NoneType` object.

## Identification of potential error locations:
The potential error location in the buggy function is the following line:
```python
if len(self.columns) > 0:
```
Here, the `len(self.columns)` operation is causing the `TypeError` when `self.columns` is `None`.

## Cause of the bug:
The bug is causing a `TypeError` because the code is trying to get the length of `self.columns` without first checking if `self.columns` is `None`. This conflicts with the test scenario outlined in the failing test, which expects the code to handle the case where `columns` is `None`.

## Strategy for fixing the bug:
To fix the bug, we need to modify the condition that checks the length of `self.columns` to ensure it doesn't error out when `self.columns` is `None`. We can achieve this by checking if `self.columns` is not `None` before attempting to get its length in the `copy` function.

## Corrected Version:
Here is the corrected version of the `copy` function in `luigi/contrib/redshift.py`:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns is not None and len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

By adding the condition `if self.columns is not None and len(self.columns) > 0`, we ensure that the code doesn't try to get the length of `self.columns` when it is `None`, thereby fixing the bug and allowing the function to handle the scenario when `columns` is `None`.
