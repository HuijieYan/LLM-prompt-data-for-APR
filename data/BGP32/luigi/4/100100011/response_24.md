### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `copy` in `luigi/contrib/redshift.py` is failing due to the `if` condition that checks the length of `self.columns`.
2. The failing test `test_s3_copy_with_nonetype_columns` in `test/contrib/redshift_test.py` is mocking the `DummyS3CopyToTableKey` task and checking the execution of the `copy` method in `S3CopyToTable` class.
3. The GitHub issue indicates that the bug occurs when `columns` is `None`, resulting in a `TypeError`. The suggested solution is to change the condition to `if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0`.
4. To fix the bug, we should update the `if` condition to handle the case where `self.columns` can be `None`.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
- Update the `if` condition to consider the case when `self.columns` is `None`.
- Check if `self.columns` is not `None` before checking its length.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

By updating the `if` condition as suggested, the corrected version of the function should now handle the case where `self.columns` is `None` gracefully and pass the failing test case.
