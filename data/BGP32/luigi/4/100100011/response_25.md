## Analyzing the buggy function

The buggy function `copy` in the `luigi/contrib/redshift.py` file has a bug related to how it handles the `columns` parameter. The issue reported on GitHub mentions that when `columns` is set to `None`, it leads to a `TypeError`. The function constructs a `COPY` SQL statement for Redshift, and the bug occurs when trying to iterate over `self.columns` without checking if it is `None`.

## Identifying potential error locations

The error is likely to occur in the following line:
```python
if len(self.columns) > 0:
```
Here, the code assumes `self.columns` is not `None` before attempting to get its length, which causes the `TypeError` when `self.columns` is actually `None`.

## Explanation of the bug

The bug occurs because the function does not handle the case when `self.columns` is `None`. This can be seen in the failing test function `test_s3_copy_with_nonetype_columns` that passes `columns=None` to the task and expects the `COPY` statement to have no column names due to `columns` being `None`. However, the buggy function does not have proper handling for this scenario, leading to the `TypeError`.

## Strategy for fixing the bug

To fix the bug, we need to check if `self.columns` is not `None` before trying to get its length. This will prevent the `TypeError` and allow the function to work correctly when `columns` is `None`.

## Corrected version of the buggy function

Here is the corrected version of the `copy` function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns is not None and len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

By adding the check `if self.columns is not None and len(self.columns) > 0:`, we ensure that the function correctly handles the case when `columns` is `None`.

This corrected version should resolve the issue reported on GitHub and pass the failing test function.
