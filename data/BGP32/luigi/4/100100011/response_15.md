### Analysis:
1. The `copy` function in the `redshift.py` file is failing when `self.columns` is `None`.
2. The failing test `test_s3_copy_with_nonetype_columns` is mocking the behavior and expecting the `COPY` statement to have empty `colnames` when columns are set to `None`.
3. The GitHub issue points out that the bug occurs due to the check `if len(self.columns) > 0` when `self.columns` is `None`.
4. The suggested solution is to modify the condition to `if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0` to handle the case when `self.columns` is `None`.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is caused by trying to call `len` on `None` when `self.columns` is `None`, resulting in a `TypeError`.

### Fix Strategy:
To fix this bug, we need to update the condition to first check if `self.columns` is not `None` before attempting to get its length.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:  # Check if self.columns is not None before getting its length
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

This corrected version will handle the case when `self.columns` is `None` and should pass the failing test and resolve the issue reported on GitHub.
