## Analysis:
1. The `copy` function in the `luigi/contrib/redshift.py` file is attempting to construct a `COPY` SQL statement for copying data from S3 to Redshift.
2. The bug seems to be related to the handling of the `columns` attribute. If `self.columns` is None, then attempting to check the length of `self.columns` (`len(self.columns)`) will raise a `TypeError`.
3. The failing test `test_s3_copy_with_nonetype_columns` in `test/contrib/redshift_test.py` is trying to test the behavior when `columns` is None, which is triggering the bug.
4. The GitHub issue highlights the specific problem where the bug occurs when `columns` is not provided, leading to a `TypeError` due to the attempt to call `len` on a `NoneType` object.
   
## Bug Cause:
The bug occurs because the function doesn't handle the case when `self.columns` is None, resulting in trying to get the length of a `NoneType` object, which raises a `TypeError`.

## Suggested Fix:
To fix the bug, we should check if `self.columns` is not None before attempting to get its length. 

## Corrected Version:
```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from S3 into Redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
``` 

By adding the `if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:` check, we ensure that the `copy` function handles the case when `columns` is None correctly and prevents the `TypeError` from occurring.
