Here is the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: luigi/contrib/redshift.py

# Corrected function
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

### Analysis:
- The bug in the original function is a syntax error caused by not properly handling the SQL query string. Specifically, the placeholders `{table}`, `{colnames}`, `{source}`, `{creds}`, and `{options}` are not properly formatted and may not be replaced as intended when executing the query.

### Bug Cause:
- The cause of the bug is due to improper string formatting in the `cursor.execute` statement. The placeholders for `{table}`, `{colnames}`, `{source}`, `{creds}`, and `{options}` are not structured correctly, leading to potential errors while trying to replace them with actual values.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, the placeholders in the SQL query string need to be properly formatted for string replacement. Using f-strings or the `.format()` method correctly will ensure that the placeholders are replaced with the actual values when executing the query.

In the corrected version provided, the placeholders have been properly structured within the `cursor.execute` statement using the `.format()` method.

By correcting the formatting of the placeholders, the function should now be able to execute the SQL query correctly without syntax errors.
