### Analysis:
The buggy function `copy` in `luigi.contrib.redshift.py` is a method that defines copying data from S3 into Redshift. It constructs a SQL `COPY` query string using various parameters. The bug seems to be related to building the `colnames` string for the column names and its subsequent usage.

### Potential Error Locations:
1. The `colnames = ""` initialization is unnecessary.
2. If there are no columns, the `colnames` variable may remain empty, causing issues in the SQL query generation or execution.
3. The use of `colnames` directly in the query without proper handling if it's empty could cause syntax errors in the SQL query.

### Cause of the Bug:
The bug in the function lies in the way the `colnames` variable is handled. If there are no columns specified, the `colnames` variable remains empty, leading to potential syntax errors in the generated SQL query.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we should check if there are columns specified before constructing the `colnames` string. If there are no columns, we should handle this case appropriately in the SQL query generation.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    
    colnames = ''
    
    if self.columns:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

In the corrected version, we first check if `self.columns` is not empty. If there are columns specified, we construct the `colnames` string; otherwise, we leave it empty. This fix ensures that the SQL query is generated correctly even when there are no columns specified.
