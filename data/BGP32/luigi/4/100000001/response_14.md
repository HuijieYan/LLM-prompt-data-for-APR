## Analysis:
The buggy function seems to be a method inside a class related to copying data from S3 into Redshift. It is utilizing string formatting to construct a SQL query that performs the data copy operation.

## Identified Error Locations:
1. The `{options}` placeholder in the SQL query seems to be problematic as it is not handling optional arguments correctly.
2. The placeholder `{creds}` where `_credentials()` method is called might be causing issues if the method doesn't return a string in the correct format.

## Cause of Bug:
The bug in this function might be caused by incorrect handling of optional arguments for `options` and errors in the `_credentials()` method.

## Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
1. Ensure that optional arguments like `options` are properly handled within the string formatting.
2. Check and correct any issues in the `_credentials()` method to ensure it returns a valid string for the credentials.

## Corrected Version:
```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from S3 into Redshift.
    
    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {copy_options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        copy_options=self.copy_options if self.copy_options else "")
    )
```

In the corrected version, I have added a conditional check for `copy_options` to handle cases where it might not be provided. The `{copy_options}` placeholder is now filled with an empty string if `copy_options` is not specified. This should prevent any errors related to missing data in the SQL query.
