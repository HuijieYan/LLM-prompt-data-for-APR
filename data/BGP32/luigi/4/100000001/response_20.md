The potential error location in the buggy function is in the way the SQL query is formatted within the `cursor.execute()` method. There is a missing single quote around the CREDENTIALS placeholder.

The bug in the function is caused by the missing single quote around the `{creds}` parameter in the SQL query string. This can lead to a syntax error when executing the query.

To fix the bug, we need to add single quotes around the `{creds}` parameter in the SQL query.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
``` 

In the corrected version, we added single quotes around the `{creds}` parameter in the SQL query string to ensure correct syntax.
