## Bug Analysis:
The buggy function `copy` in the `luigi/contrib/redshift.py` file has the following potential errors:
- There is an issue with the formatting of the SQL query string within the `cursor.execute()` function. The string concatenation might be causing problems, especially with the `options` part of the string.

## Cause of the Bug:
The bug in the provided function is likely caused by the improper formatting and concatenation of the SQL query string. If any of the variables (`self.table`, `colnames`, `f`, `self._credentials()`, `self.copy_options`) contain special characters or invalid data types, it can lead to SQL syntax errors or query execution failures.

## Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we should use parameterized queries instead of string concatenation when constructing SQL queries. Parameterized queries help prevent SQL injection vulnerabilities and handle special characters properly. This can be achieved by passing the variables as parameters to the `cursor.execute()` function instead of directly embedding them in the query string.

## Corrected Version:
Here's the corrected version of the `copy` function using parameterized queries:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    query = """
    COPY {table} {colnames} from %s
    CREDENTIALS %s
    %s
    ;""".format(table=self.table, colnames=colnames)

    cursor.execute(query, (f, self._credentials(), self.copy_options))
```

In the corrected version, the SQL query is constructed using parameterized placeholders (%s) for the variables that need to be passed in. The `cursor.execute()` function now takes the query string and a tuple of parameters to be substituted into the query. This approach helps avoid SQL injection issues and ensures proper handling of special characters.
