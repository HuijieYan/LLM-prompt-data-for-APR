Potential Error Locations:
1. Issue with the `COPY` statement in the `cursor.execute` method.
2. Incorrect formatting of the SQL query string.

Cause of the Bug:
The bug in the provided function is related to the formatting of the SQL query string within the `cursor.execute` method. Due to incorrect indentation and formatting, the `COPY` statement and its parameters are not properly aligned, causing a syntax error when executing the query.

Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, the `COPY` statement and its parameters should be properly aligned and formatted within the `cursor.execute` method. This can be achieved by ensuring correct indentation and spacing for each parameter of the query.

Corrected Version:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} 
     FROM '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

In the corrected version, the `COPY` statement and its parameters are properly aligned within the `cursor.execute` method. This ensures that the SQL query string is formatted correctly and can be executed without syntax errors.
