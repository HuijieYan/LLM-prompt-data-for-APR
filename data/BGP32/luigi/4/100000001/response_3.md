The buggy function provided is a `copy` function that is meant to handle copying data from an S3 source into Redshift. There are a few potential error locations within the function that could lead to bugs:

1. Improper formatting of `colnames` variable: The `colnames` variable is being constructed by joining the column names from `self.columns`, but it is not being handled properly in the SQL query construction.
2. Missing a closing `'` in the SQL query for the `source` parameter.
3. Unspecified behavior of the `_credentials()` method: The function calls `_credentials()` method, but it is not clear what this method does or returns.

The cause of the bug in this function is likely due to improper handling of the `colnames` variable in the SQL query construction. The `colnames` variable is being constructed correctly, but it is not properly inserted into the SQL query which can lead to syntax errors or incorrect behavior.

To fix the bug, we should ensure that the `colnames` variable is inserted correctly into the SQL query. Additionally, we should check if the `_credentials()` method returns the proper credentials string for Redshift.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from S3 into Redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

In this corrected version, the `colnames` variable is inserted properly into the SQL query to ensure that the column names are handled correctly. Additionally, make sure that the `_credentials()` method returns the correct credentials string for Redshift.
