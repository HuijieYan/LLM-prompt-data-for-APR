There are a few potential errors in the buggy function:
1. The `creds` placeholder in the query is missing the `aws_iam_role` parameter.
2. The format string used in the `cursor.execute` statement may not be handling the placeholders correctly.

The cause of the bug is likely due to the missing `aws_iam_role` parameter in the `CREDENTIALS` statement, which is essential for role-based credentials for Redshift.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the `aws_iam_role` parameter is included in the `CREDENTIALS` statement. We also need to correct the format string to handle the placeholders properly.

Here is a corrected version of the function:

```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: luigi/contrib/redshift.py

def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS 'aws_iam_role={role};{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        role=self.aws_iam_role,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

In the corrected version, the `aws_iam_role` parameter is included in the `CREDENTIALS` statement along with the `creds` parameter. The placeholders in the format string are correctly handling the variables required for the query.
