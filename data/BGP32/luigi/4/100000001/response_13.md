## Buggy Function Analysis:
- The `copy` function is trying to copy data from a source (presumably a S3 bucket) into a Redshift table.
- It constructs a SQL query using string formatting to execute the `COPY` command.
- The function checks if there are any columns specified for the target table and constructs a comma-separated list of column names.

## Potential Errors:
1. There's a potential issue in the formatting of the SQL query string.
2. The `colnames` string is being constructed without considering the case where no columns are specified.
3. There might be an issue with the `_credentials()` method being called to get the credentials for Redshift.

## Bug Cause:
The bug occurs when the `colnames` string is not properly handled when no columns are specified for the target table. This results in an incorrect SQL query being generated, potentially causing syntax errors.

## Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to check if `colnames` is empty and handle it appropriately in the SQL query construction. Additionally, ensure that the `_credentials()` method is correctly providing the Redshift credentials needed for the `COPY` command.

## Corrected Version:
```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)
        
    credentials = self._credentials() if self._credentials() else ''
    
    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     {credentials}
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        credentials="CREDENTIALS '{}'".format(credentials) if credentials else '',
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

In the corrected version:
- If `colnames` is empty, it will not include an empty string in the SQL query.
- The `credentials` section is constructed based on the output of the `_credentials()` method, ensuring that it is correctly included in the query.
- Handle potential edge cases where either `columns` or `credentials` are empty or not provided.
