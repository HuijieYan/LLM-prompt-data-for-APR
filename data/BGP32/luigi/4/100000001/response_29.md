# The potential error location is the use of a multiline string for the SQL query within the `cursor.execute` call.

# The cause of the bug is that multi-line strings in Python may introduce unintended white spaces or newlines, which could lead to syntax errors in the SQL query being executed.

# A strategy to fix the bug is to use the triple-double quotes `"""` or triple-single quotes `'''` to define the multi-line string for the SQL query to avoid any whitespace or newline issues.

# Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = '' 
    if len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
