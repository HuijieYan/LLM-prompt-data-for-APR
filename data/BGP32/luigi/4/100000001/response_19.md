## Analysis:
The buggy function `copy` is trying to execute a `COPY` command to copy data from S3 into Redshift. The function constructs a SQL query string using formatted string with placeholders for table name, column names, source location, credentials, and copy options.

## Potential Error Locations:
1. There might be an issue with how the SQL query is constructed.
2. Potential issues with placeholders and formatting.
3. Mistakes in constructing the `colnames` string from column names.
4. Incorrect handling of `self.columns` and `self.copy_options`.

## Bug Cause:
The bug in the provided function is likely due to jumbled formatting of the SQL query string. The placeholders `{table}`, `{colnames}`, `{source}`, `{creds}`, and `{options}` might not be getting replaced with the appropriate values properly, leading to syntax errors.

## Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the placeholders in the SQL query string are correctly replaced with the corresponding values. We also need to check the construction of `colnames` to avoid syntax errors in the generated SQL query.

## Corrected Version:
```python
import logging

logger = logging.getLogger()

def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from S3 into Redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

In the corrected version, the issues related to string formatting and placeholder replacement have been addressed. The `colnames` construction has also been corrected to ensure it doesn't cause syntax errors in the SQL query.
