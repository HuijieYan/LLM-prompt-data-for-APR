## Analysis and Explanation:
The buggy function `copy` is designed to copy data from an S3 source into Redshift using SQL COPY command. The bug in this function is caused by the way the `source` parameter is being formatted in the execute SQL query. 

The `source = f` in the query string is directly inserted into the SQL query without proper quoting. This can lead to SQL injection vulnerabilities and errors, especially when the `f` parameter contains special characters or spaces. This bug can cause the SQL query to fail or execute incorrectly, leading to data corruption or unauthorized access.

## Error Location:
The error is in the `cursor.execute` call where the `source` parameter is being inserted directly without proper quoting.

## Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix this bug, the `source` parameter should be properly escaped or quoted before inserting it into the SQL query string. This can be achieved using parameterized queries or proper string formatting.

## Corrected Version:
Here is the corrected version of the `copy` function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from %s
     CREDENTIALS %s
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        options=self.copy_options), (f, self._credentials())
    )
```

In the corrected version, the `source` parameter is replaced with `%s` and passed as a parameter in the `cursor.execute` call along with properly quoted `credentials`. This ensures that the `source` parameter is properly escaped and prevents SQL injection vulnerabilities.
