### Analysis:
The buggy function `copy` is used to copy data from S3 into Redshift. The function constructs a SQL query to perform the copy operation. However, there is a bug in the way the `colnames` variable is constructed and used within the query.

### Potential Error Locations:
1. The `colnames` variable might cause an issue if `self.columns` is empty, as there is no check for an empty columns list before constructing the `colnames` string.
2. `creds=self._credentials()` is used without clarifying what `_credentials()` returns.

### Cause of the Bug:
The bug arises when `self.columns` is empty, leading to an empty `colnames` string being inserted into the SQL query. This can cause an error when the query is executed due to incorrect syntax or missing columns in the `COPY` command.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
1. Check if `self.columns` is empty before constructing the `colnames` string.
2. Handle the scenario where there are no columns in `self.columns` by providing a default value or skipping the `colnames` section in the query.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from S3 into Redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns:  # Check if self.columns is not empty
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

By adding the check `if self.columns:` before constructing the `colnames` string, we ensure that an empty `colnames` string is not inserted into the SQL query when there are no columns. This fix addresses the potential bug and improves the function's robustness.
