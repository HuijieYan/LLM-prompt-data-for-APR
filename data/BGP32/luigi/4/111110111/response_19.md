## Analysis
1. The `copy` function in the `S3CopyToTable` class is designed to copy data from s3 into Redshift. The bug occurs when the `columns` attribute is `None`, leading to a `TypeError` when trying to check its length. 
2. The buggy function does not handle the case where `self.columns` is `None`. It tries to access the length of `self.columns` directly without checking if it's not `None`.
3. The failing test `test_s3_copy_with_nonetype_columns` creates an instance of `DummyS3CopyToTableKey` with `columns=None`. When the `run` method is called, the `copy` function is executed, resulting in a `TypeError` due to trying to get the length of a `NoneType` object.
4. To fix the bug, we need to update the `copy` function to first check if `self.columns` is not `None` before trying to access its length.
5. The fixed version of the function is provided below.

### Corrected Version
```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:  # Check if self.columns is not None before accessing length
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options())
    )
```

By adding the check `if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0`, we ensure that the length of `self.columns` is accessed only if it's not `None`. This modification resolves the `TypeError` when `columns` is `None`.
