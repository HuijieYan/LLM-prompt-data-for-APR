## Analysis
1. The buggy function `copy` within the `S3CopyToTable` class in `luigi/contrib/redshift.py` is failing due to the `if len(self.columns) > 0:` line, where it tries to get the length of `self.columns`. If `self.columns` is `None`, it results in a `TypeError`.
2. The failing test `test_s3_copy_with_nonetype_columns` in `test/contrib/redshift_test.py` creates an instance of `DummyS3CopyToTableKey` with `columns=None`, which triggers the bug when the `copy` method is called.
3. The expected behavior is for the check `if len(self.columns) > 0:` to handle cases where `self.columns` might be `None`. The GitHub issue suggests fixing it by changing the condition to `if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:`.
   
## Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we will update the conditional check in the `copy` method to handle the case when `self.columns` is `None`. By modifying the condition to check if `self.columns` is not `None` before getting its length, we can prevent the `TypeError`.
   
## Bug-fixed version of the function
```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options())
    )
```

By incorporating the updated condition `if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:`, we ensure that the code handles the case where `self.columns` is `None` and prevents the `TypeError` encountered in the failing test. This fix aligns with the suggested solution in the GitHub issue.
