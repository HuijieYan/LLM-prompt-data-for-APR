To fix the bug in the `copy` function of the `S3CopyToTable` class, we need to address the issue with checking the length of the `columns` attribute when it is `None`. The current implementation raises a `TypeError` when trying to check the length of a `NoneType` object.

### Cause of the bug:
The bug occurs because the code in the `copy` function is checking the length of `self.columns` without considering the case when `self.columns` is `None`, resulting in a `TypeError`.

### Strategy for fixing the bug:
To fix the bug, we need to handle the case when `self.columns` is `None` before checking its length. We can modify the condition to ensure that `self.columns` is not `None` before proceeding with checking its length.

### Corrected version of the `copy` function:
```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    
    if self.columns is not None and len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options())
    )
```

In the corrected version of the `copy` function:
- We first check if `self.columns` is not `None` before trying to access its length.
- If `self.columns` is not `None` and has a length greater than 0, we proceed with constructing the `colnames` string.
- We call the `copy_options` function correctly with parentheses `()` to invoke it as a method.

By making these changes, we ensure that the `copy` function can handle the case when `self.columns` is `None` and avoid the `TypeError` that was occurring previously. This corrected version should satisfy the expected input/output values and fix the bug reported in the GitHub issue.
