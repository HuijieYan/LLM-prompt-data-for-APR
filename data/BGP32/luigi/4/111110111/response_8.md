### Analysis
1. The buggy function is the `copy` method inside the `S3CopyToTable` class in the `redshift.py` file. The function is responsible for executing a `COPY` command to load data from S3 into Redshift.
   
2. The bug occurs due to checking the length of `self.columns`, which is set to `None` when not provided. This results in a `TypeError` when trying to call `len(None)`.

3. The failing test `test_s3_copy_with_nonetype_columns` creates a task with `columns=None` and expects the `COPY` command to be executed with an empty set of columns. The error message confirms that the issue arises from checking the length of None.

4. To fix the bug, we need to modify the condition to check if `self.columns` is not None before attempting to get its length. We can use `if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0` to handle this scenario.

### Bug Fix
```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:  # Check if self.columns is not None before getting its length
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options())
    )
```

By adding the `if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:` condition, we ensure that we only attempt to get the length of `self.columns` if it is not `None`, avoiding the `TypeError` when `columns` is not provided.

This fix aligns with the expected behavior of the `copy` method and resolves the issue reported on GitHub.
