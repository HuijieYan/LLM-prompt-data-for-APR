To fix the bug in the `copy` function, we need to address the issue where it tries to check the length of `self.columns` even when it is `None`. We can modify the condition to check if `self.columns` is not `None` before attempting to get its length.

Here is the corrected version of the `copy` function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns is not None and len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

By checking if `self.columns` is not `None` before evaluating its length, we prevent the `TypeError: object of type 'NoneType' has no len()` error from occurring.

This corrected version of the function should pass the failing test case provided, and satisfy the expected input/output values and types. It also addresses the issue mentioned in the GitHub post related to this bug.
