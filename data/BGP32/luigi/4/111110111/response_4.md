## Correction:

### Explanation:
The error is occurring because the `copy` function is trying to check the length of `self.columns`, which is `None` in the case of the test scenario where `columns=None`. This causes a `TypeError` since `None` does not have a length property. To fix this, we should first check if `self.columns` is not `None` before proceeding with the length check.

### Updated `copy` function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:  # Check if self.columns is not None before getting its length
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options())
    )
```

By updating the condition to `if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0`, we ensure that the code only attempts to get the length of `self.columns` if it is not `None`. This change will prevent the `TypeError` when `columns=None`.

This correction aligns with the GitHub issue suggestion as well.

This should resolve the issue and the test should now pass without any errors.
