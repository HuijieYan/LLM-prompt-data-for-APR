## Analysis
1. The buggy function `copy` within the `S3CopyToTable` class in the `redshift.py` file is trying to check the length of `self.columns`, which is set to `None`, causing a `TypeError` when attempting to call `len(self.columns)`.
2. The error message in the failing test indicates that the `columns` attribute is explicitly set to `None`, leading to the TypeError during the execution.
3. The expected behavior is that when `columns` is `None`, the `colnames` variable should be an empty string. The proposed GitHub issue also suggests a similar solution.
4. To fix the bug, we should update the conditional check to properly handle the case when `self.columns` is `None`.

## Bug Fix
```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:  # Updated conditional check to handle None
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

With this update, the function will correctly handle the case when `self.columns` is `None`, preventing the `TypeError` and aligning with the expected behavior.
