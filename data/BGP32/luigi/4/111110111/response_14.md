To fix the bug in the `copy` function of the `S3CopyToTable` class in the `luigi/contrib/redshift.py` file, the condition `if len(self.columns) > 0:` should be modified to `if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:` to prevent the `TypeError` that occurs when `self.columns` is `None`.

Here is the corrected version of the `copy` function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:  # Modified condition
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

This modification ensures that the `if` condition checks if `self.columns` is not `None` before attempting to retrieve its length. This change addresses the issue raised in the failing test case related to `columns` being `None`.

After applying this fix, the `copy` function should now handle the case where `self.columns` is `None`, preventing the `TypeError` and ensuring that the function behaves as expected in various scenarios.
