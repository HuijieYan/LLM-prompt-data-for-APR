## Correction of the buggy function

```python
    def copy(self, cursor, f):
        """
        Defines copying from s3 into redshift.
    
        If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
        """
        logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
        colnames = ''
        if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:  # Check if self.columns is not None before accessing its length
            colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
            colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)
    
        cursor.execute(f"""
         COPY {self.table} {colnames} from '{f}'
         CREDENTIALS '{self._credentials()}'
         {self.copy_options()} ;""")
```

By adding a check `if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:` before trying to access the length of `self.columns`, we ensure that we are not operating on a NoneType object. Additionally, I made the SQL query generation more concise by using f-strings for readability.

This correction addresses the issue where the buggy function was throwing a TypeError when `self.columns` were passed as None, causing the function to fail.
