## Analysis
1. The buggy function `copy` in the `S3CopyToTable` class in the `luigi/contrib/redshift.py` file fails when `self.columns` is `None`, resulting in a `TypeError`.
2. The failing test `test_s3_copy_with_nonetype_columns` creates an instance of `DummyS3CopyToTableKey` with `columns=None` and calls `task.run()` causing the `copy` method to be invoked with `self.columns` being `None`.
3. The expected behavior should be to handle the case where `self.columns` is `None` gracefully and not attempt to access its length.
4. The provided GitHub issue suggests a solution of checking if `self.columns` is not None before attempting to get its length.

## Correction Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to modify the `copy` function to check if `self.columns` is not None before attempting to access its length. This will prevent the `TypeError` when `self.columns` is `None`.

## Corrected Code
```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns is not None and len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options())
    )
```

By adding the check `if self.columns is not None and len(self.columns) > 0`, we ensure that we only try to access the length of `self.columns` if it is not `None`. This change will prevent the `TypeError` in the original buggy function.
