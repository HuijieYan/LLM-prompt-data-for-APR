## Analysis
1. The buggy function `copy` in the `S3CopyToTable` class of `luigi/contrib/redshift.py` is utilized to define the copying operation from S3 into Redshift.
2. The error occurs when trying to calculate the length of `self.columns` which is `None` in the test case, leading to a `TypeError`.
3. The cause of the bug is that the condition `if len(self.columns) > 0` attempts to check the length of `self.columns` directly without considering the case where `self.columns` is `None`.
4. To fix the bug, it is necessary to modify the condition to first check if `self.columns` exists and then evaluate its length.
5. The corrected version of the function should handle the case of `self.columns` being `None` before attempting to calculate its length.

## Correction
```python
    def copy(self, cursor, f):
        """
        Defines copying from s3 into redshift.
    
        If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
        """
        logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
        colnames = ''
        if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:
            colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
            colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)
    
        cursor.execute("""
         COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
         CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
         {options}
         ;""".format(
            table=self.table,
            colnames=colnames,
            source=f,
            creds=self._credentials(),
            options=self.copy_options())
        )
```

By updating the conditional check to `if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0`, we ensure that the length of `self.columns` is only calculated when it exists and is not `None`. This modification addresses the issue identified in the failing test case and aligns with the expected behavior under such circumstances.
