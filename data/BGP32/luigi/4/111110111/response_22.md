To resolve the issue, we need to update the logic in the `copy` function to handle cases where `self.columns` is `None`. The current code is triggering an error because it attempts to check the length of `None`, which is not allowed and results in a `TypeError`.

Here is the corrected version of the `copy` function:
```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options())
    )
```

Explanation:
- The `if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:` condition now ensures that the length of `self.columns` is checked only when it exists and is not None.
- By updating the condition, we prevent the `TypeError` that was occurring when trying to check the length of `None`.
- Additionally, the `options=self.copy_options` in the formatted string was corrected to `options=self.copy_options()` to actually call the `copy_options` function.

With these changes, the `copy` function will handle cases where `self.columns` is None and execute without errors, resolving the issue described in the GitHub problem.
