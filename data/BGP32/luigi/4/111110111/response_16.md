## Analysis
1. The buggy function `copy` in the `S3CopyToTable` class in `luigi/contrib/redshift.py` is attempting to get the length of `self.columns`, which causes an error when `self.columns` is `None`.
2. The failing test `test_s3_copy_with_nonetype_columns` is designed to test the behavior of the function when `columns` is set to `None`.
3. The error message indicates a `TypeError` due to trying to find the length of a `NoneType` object.
4. To fix the bug, we need to check if `self.columns` is not `None` before trying to get its length.

## Bug Fix Strategy
Modify the `copy` function to add a conditional check to ensure that `self.columns` is not `None` before performing any operations that require its length.

## Corrected Version
```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.
    
    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''

    if self.columns is not None and len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options())
    )
```

In this corrected version, we added a conditional check on `self.columns` to ensure it is not `None` before proceeding to get its length and use it in the subsequent operations. This fix should address the `TypeError` that occurs when `columns` is `None`.
