## Analysis:
1. The buggy function `copy` in the `S3CopyToTable` class within the `luigi/contrib/redshift.py` file is causing the `TypeError: object of type 'NoneType' has no len()` error when the `columns` attribute is set to `None`.
2. The issue arises when trying to calculate the length of `self.columns` without checking if it is `None` first.
3. The failing test `test_s3_copy_with_nonetype_columns` exercises the behavior when `columns` is set to `None`, leading to the error.
4. To resolve this issue, the `copy` function should be modified to include a check for `None` before checking the length of `self.columns`, as suggested in the GitHub issue.

## Bug Fix:
```python
class S3CopyToTable(rdbms.CopyToTable, _CredentialsMixin):

    def copy(self, cursor, f):
        """
        Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

        If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
        """
        logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
        colnames = ''
        if self.columns is not None and len(self.columns) > 0:  # Check for None before checking length
            colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
            colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

        cursor.execute("""
         COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
         CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
         {options}
         ;""".format(
            table=self.table,
            colnames=colnames,
            source=f,
            creds=self._credentials(),
            options=self.copy_options())
        )
```

By adding the check `if self.columns is not None` before checking the length, we ensure that the code does not attempt to get the length of `None`. This modification resolves the `TypeError` when `columns` is set to `None`, addressing the bug reported in the GitHub issue.
