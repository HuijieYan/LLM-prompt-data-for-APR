To fix the bug in the `copy` function, we need to address the error caused by checking the length of `self.columns`, which can be `None`. The fix involves checking if `self.columns` is not `None` before attempting to get its length. 

Here is the corrected version of the `copy` function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
        """
        Defines copying from s3 into redshift.
    
        If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
        """
        logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
        colnames = ''
        if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:
            colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
            colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)
    
        cursor.execute("""
         COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
         CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
         {options}
         ;""".format(
            table=self.table,
            colnames=colnames,
            source=f,
            creds=self._credentials(),
            options=self.copy_options())
        )
```

In this corrected version, we added the check `if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:` before attempting to get the length of `self.columns`. This check ensures that if `self.columns` is `None`, the length will not be calculated, avoiding the `TypeError` that was encountered.

By making this change, the corrected function should now pass the failing test case and resolve the GitHub issue related to this bug.
