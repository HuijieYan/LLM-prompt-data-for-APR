To fix the bug in the `copy` function of the `S3CopyToTable` class in the `redshift.py` file, we need to address the issue where the `self.columns` attribute is directly checked for its length without considering the case where it might be `None`, leading to a `TypeError`. The proposed solution is to first check if `self.columns` is not `None` before attempting to access its length.

Here is the corrected version of the `copy` function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    
    if self.columns is not None and len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options())
    )
```

By adding the check `if self.columns is not None and len(self.columns) > 0`, we ensure that we only attempt to access the length of `self.columns` when it is not `None`, preventing the `TypeError` that was occurring when `columns` was `None`.

This corrected version should pass the failing test case provided and also satisfy the expected input/output variable values mentioned.
