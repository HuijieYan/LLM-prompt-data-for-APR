## Analyzing the buggy function and identifying potential errors
The buggy function is a method named `copy` that is supposed to define copying from an S3 source into a Redshift database. The function builds a query using the provided parameters and executes it using the `cursor`.

### Identified issues:
1. The `creds` parameter is being formatted incorrectly using `self._credentials()` without considering any potential formatting issues.
2. There seems to be a potential issue with the formatting of the `COPY` query itself, as it might not be building the query with the correct syntax.

## Cause of the bug
The bug likely arises from the incorrect formatting of the `creds` parameter and the `COPY` query in the `cursor.execute` statement. These issues could result in syntax errors when trying to execute the SQL query.

## Strategy for fixing the bug
1. Properly format the `creds` parameter in the SQL query.
2. Verify the syntax of the `COPY` query being built to ensure it matches the expected Redshift syntax.

## The corrected version of the function
```python

# corrected version of the buggy function
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS 'aws_access_key_id={access_key};aws_secret_access_key={secret_key}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        access_key=self.aws_access_key,
        secret_key=self.aws_secret_key,
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

By correcting the formatting of the `creds` parameter using the `aws_access_key_id` and `aws_secret_access_key`, and ensuring the `COPY` query is constructed correctly, the function should now execute the Redshift copy operation as expected.
