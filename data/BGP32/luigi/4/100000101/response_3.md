The bug in the provided function is related to the incorrect format of the SQL query string being passed to the `cursor.execute()` function. The curly braces `{}` used for formatting the query are not properly formatted which causes a syntax error.

To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the string formatting placeholders `{}` are properly formatted so that the SQL query is constructed correctly.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
import logging

logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)

def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS 'aws_access_key_id={access_key};aws_secret_access_key={secret_key}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        access_key=self.access_key,
        secret_key=self.secret_key,
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

This corrected version ensures that the SQL query is properly formatted and the placeholders are substituted with the correct values before executing the query.
