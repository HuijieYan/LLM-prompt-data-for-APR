The bug in the provided function is that the `colnames` variable is not being correctly initialized or formatted when constructing the SQL query string. This results in an incorrect query being executed when calling `cursor.execute()`.

To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the `colnames` variable is properly formatted and included in the SQL query. We can initialize `colnames` with an empty string outside of the if statement and then update it with the column names if they exist.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

With this correction, the `colnames` variable will be correctly formatted based on the column names provided in `self.columns`, ensuring that the SQL query is properly constructed and executed.
