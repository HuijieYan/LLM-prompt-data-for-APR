The bug in the provided function is that the `source` parameter is being passed as `f` directly instead of properly formatting it as an S3 URI in the SQL query.

The buggy function is not correctly formatting the `source` parameter for the `COPY` command in Redshift. It should be formatted as an S3 URI within single quotes. However, in the buggy code, it is directly inserting the value of `f` without the necessary formatting.

To fix this bug, we need to format the `source` parameter properly as an S3 URI within single quotes.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source='\'{}\''.format(f),  # format source as S3 URI
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

This corrected version formats the `source` parameter as an S3 URI within single quotes, which is the correct format for the `COPY` command in Redshift.
