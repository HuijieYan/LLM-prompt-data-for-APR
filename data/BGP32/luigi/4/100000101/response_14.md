The bug in the provided function is that the placeholder `{creds}` is used for the credentials string, but it should be actually represented as `{credentials}`. 

To fix the bug, we need to update the placeholder in the `cursor.execute` statement from `{creds}` to `{credentials}`.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: luigi/contrib/redshift.py

def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{credentials}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        credentials=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

With this correction, the function should now correctly insert the file into Redshift using the provided credentials.
