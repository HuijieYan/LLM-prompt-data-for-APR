### Analysis:
The buggy function contains a call to `cursor.execute` to execute a COPY command on a Redshift table. The bug seems to be related to the way the query string is formatted, as it may not be correctly substituting the values for `table`, `colnames`, `source`, `creds`, and `options` in the query.

### Bug:
The bug in the function is that the `colnames` variable is being concatenated with the query string directly, without checking if it is empty or not. This can result in an incorrect query being formed if `self.columns` is empty.

### Fix:
We need to check if `colnames` is empty before including it in the query string. If it is empty, we should avoid including it in the query.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    query = """
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    
    if not colnames:
        query = query.replace(colnames, '')

    cursor.execute(query)
``` 

This corrected version checks if `colnames` is empty before including it in the query string. If it is empty, it removes the empty parentheses from the query to avoid syntax errors. This fix ensures that the query is formed correctly regardless of the presence of columns.
