The bug in the provided function is that the colnames variable is not properly formatted when constructing the SQL query. The function attempts to use a placeholder for column names when none are provided, resulting in an empty string for colnames. This leads to an incorrect SQL query format when executing cursor.execute().

To fix this bug:
1. Check if column names are provided before constructing the colnames variable and the SQL query.
2. Only include the colnames in the SQL query if they are provided.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)
    
    colnames_sql = colnames if colnames else ''  # include colnames only if they are provided

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames_sql} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames_sql=colnames_sql,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

This corrected version ensures that the colnames are only included in the SQL query if they are provided, preventing any formatting errors in the query.
