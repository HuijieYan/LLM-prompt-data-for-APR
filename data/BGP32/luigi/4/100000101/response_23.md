The bug in the provided function is the missing opening and closing parenthesis around the 'COPY' query. This causes a syntax error when executing the query.

To fix this bug, we need to add the opening and closing parenthesis to the 'COPY' query in the cursor.execute statement.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

With this correction, the 'COPY' query will have the correct syntax, and the function will execute without any syntax errors.
