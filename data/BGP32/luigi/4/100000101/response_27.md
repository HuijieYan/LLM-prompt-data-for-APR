The bug in the provided function is that the `colnames` variable is not being passed correctly in the SQL query when generating the `COPY` command. The `colnames` variable is being defined inside an `if` block but not being considered in the SQL query if it is empty.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the SQL query to include the `colnames` variable only if it is not empty.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: luigi/contrib/redshift.py

def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames='' if colnames == '' else colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )

```

This corrected version of the function checks if `colnames` is empty and only includes it in the SQL query if it is not empty. This modification ensures that the SQL query is constructed correctly regardless of whether `colnames` is empty or not.
