### Analysis
The bug in the provided function seems to be related to how the `colnames` variable is constructed. It is expected to be a comma-separated string of column names, but the if statement checking the length of `self.columns` may not be functioning correctly.

### Cause of the Bug
The bug occurs because the condition `if len(self.columns) > 0:` may not be evaluating as expected, resulting in an empty `colnames` variable being assigned instead of a string of column names.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the `colnames` variable is correctly constructed as a comma-separated string of column names when `self.columns` is not empty.

### Corrected Version of the Function
```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

In the corrected version of the function, the `if` condition `if self.columns:` is used to check if `self.columns` is not empty. This ensures that the `colnames` variable is constructed correctly as a comma-separated string of column names.
