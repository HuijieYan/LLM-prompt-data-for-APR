The bug in the provided function is likely caused by missing single quotes around the credentials in the `cursor.execute` statement. This can lead to a syntax error in the SQL query.

To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the `creds` parameter is enclosed in single quotes in the SQL query string.

Here is the corrected version of the function:
```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

This corrected version fixes the missing single quotes around the `creds` parameter in the SQL query string, ensuring correct syntax and preventing any potential errors.
