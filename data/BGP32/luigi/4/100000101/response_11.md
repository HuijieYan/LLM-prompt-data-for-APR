### Analysis
The buggy function `copy` is attempting to execute a COPY command to load data from an S3 source into a Redshift table. However, there are a few potential issues in the function:
1. The `colnames` variable might not be properly constructed based on the columns provided in `self.columns`.
2. The `creds` variable might not be correctly generated using the `_credentials` method.
3. The `options` variable might not be defined correctly.

### Cause of the Bug
The bug in the function is likely due to the incorrect construction of the `colnames` variable and the `creds` variable. The `colnames` variable is expected to be a comma-separated list of column names, but the logic for constructing it may not be working as intended. Similarly, the `_credentials` method used to generate the `creds` variable might not be returning the correct credentials string.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug
To fix the bug:
1. Ensure that the `colnames` variable is correctly constructed based on the columns provided in `self.columns`.
2. Verify that the `_credentials` method returns the correct credentials string.
3. Make sure the `options` variable is correctly defined and passed to the COPY command.

### Corrected Function
```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames) if colnames else ''

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS 'aws_access_key_id={access_key};aws_secret_access_key={secret_key}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        access_key=self._credentials()['access_key'],
        secret_key=self._credentials()['secret_key'],
        options=self.copy_options)
    )

``` 

This corrected version ensures that the `colnames` variable is constructed properly, uses the correct credentials generated by the `_credentials` method, and ensures that the `options` variable is correctly passed to the COPY command.
