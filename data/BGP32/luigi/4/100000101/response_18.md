The bug in the provided function is due to the incorrect handling of the column names when constructing the SQL query for the COPY command in Redshift.

The issue arises from the fact that the colnames variable is being set to an empty string at the beginning of the function, and then later updated based on the column names provided in the self.columns attribute. However, if there are no columns specified (as in the expected test case), colnames remains an empty string, which leads to a syntax error in the SQL query.

To fix this bug, we need to make sure that if there are no columns specified, the colnames variable should not be included in the SQL query to avoid syntax errors.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

In this corrected version, we check if self.columns is not empty before constructing the colnames variable. This ensures that the SQL query is properly constructed even when there are no columns specified.

By making this change, the function should now handle cases where no columns are provided without causing a syntax error.
