The bug in the provided function is that the `colnames` variable is not being correctly formatted when there are columns present in the self.columns attribute. This results in an incorrect SQL query being executed when calling cursor.execute().

To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the `colnames` variable is properly formatted with the column names if they exist in self.columns. We can do this by checking if self.columns has any values before constructing the colnames variable.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

This corrected version handles the formatting of the `colnames` variable correctly based on the presence of columns in the self.columns attribute. Now, the function should execute the SQL query correctly with the expected input/output values specified in the test cases.
