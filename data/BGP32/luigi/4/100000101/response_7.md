The bug in the provided function is that the `colnames` variable is empty and not being properly formatted before being used in the SQL query. This results in a syntax error in the `cursor.execute()` call.

To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the `colnames` variable is correctly formatted even when there are no columns specified.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: luigi/contrib/redshift.py

def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

This corrected version checks if there are any columns specified before formatting the `colnames` variable. This way, the SQL query will be correctly constructed even when there are no columns to include in the `COPY` statement.
