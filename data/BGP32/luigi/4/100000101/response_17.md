The bug in the provided function is due to the incorrect handling of the `colnames` variable. The code is not considering the case where `self.columns` is an empty list, leading to an empty `colnames` variable being passed to the SQL query.

To fix the bug, we need to check if `self.columns` is empty before constructing the `colnames` variable and appropriately handle this case.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    if self.columns:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)
    else:
        colnames = ''

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

With this correction, the function will correctly handle the case when `self.columns` is an empty list. Now, the `colnames` variable will be empty if `self.columns` is empty, ensuring that the SQL query is constructed correctly.
