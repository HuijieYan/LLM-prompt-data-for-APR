The bug in the provided function is that the `colnames` variable is always initialized as an empty string, regardless of the conditions. This causes an issue when the `colnames` variable is used in the query string without checking if it should be included.

To fix this bug, we need to update the code to only include the `colnames` variable in the query if there are actually columns defined in the `self.columns` list.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    query = """
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)

    cursor.execute(query)
```

This corrected version ensures that the `colnames` variable is only included in the query if there are columns defined in the `self.columns` list, preventing the use of an empty `colnames` variable in the query.
