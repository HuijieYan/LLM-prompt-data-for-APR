### Analysis
- The function is supposed to copy data from S3 into Redshift.
- The function constructs a SQL query using the input parameters and executes it using the cursor.
- The `colnames` variable is constructed by joining the column names provided in `self.columns`.
- The SQL query is constructed dynamically using the provided parameters.

### Bug Explanation
The bug in the function lies in the construction of the `colnames` variable. If the `self.columns` list is empty, the `colnames` variable remains as an empty string. However, the syntax of the SQL query expects the column names to be enclosed in parentheses '()'. If `self.columns` is empty, the parentheses should not be included in the `colnames` variable.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix this bug, we need to check if `self.columns` is empty before constructing the `colnames` variable with parentheses. If `self.columns` is not empty, then construct the `colnames` variable with parentheses.

### Corrected Version
```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames if colnames else '',  # Check if colnames is empty and handle it
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

This corrected version checks if `colnames` is empty before adding the parentheses around the column names in the SQL query. If `colnames` is empty, it doesn't include the parentheses. This fix ensures that the SQL query is constructed correctly based on the presence of column names.
