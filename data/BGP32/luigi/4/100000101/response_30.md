The issue in the buggy function lies in the formatting of the COPY SQL query. The colnames variable is being formatted with parentheses even when there are no columns specified, which leads to a syntax error when executing the query.

To fix this issue, we need to modify the logic for constructing the colnames variable so that it only includes parentheses when there are columns specified.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

This corrected version checks if there are any columns specified before formatting the colnames variable with parentheses. This will prevent any syntax errors when executing the query.
