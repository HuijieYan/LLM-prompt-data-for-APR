### Analysis
The buggy function is supposed to execute a COPY command in Redshift to copy data from an S3 source. The bug seems to be related to how the colnames variable is being handled, as it is expected to be an empty string if the self.columns list is empty. The cursor.execute() statement is also missing the proper indentation, which may cause syntax errors.

### Bug Explanation
The bug occurs because the colnames variable is not properly handled when the self.columns list is empty. This leads to a syntax error when constructing the SQL query in the cursor.execute() statement.

### Bug Fix
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the colnames variable is only included in the SQL query if the self.columns list is not empty. Additionally, we need to fix the indentation of the cursor.execute() statement.

### Corrected Function
```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: luigi/contrib/redshift.py

def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
    COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
    CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
    {options}
    ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```
