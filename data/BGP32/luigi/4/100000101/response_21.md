The bug in the provided function is that the `colnames` variable is being set as an empty string `''` and not being used in the SQL query string. This results in the `COPY` command being executed without specifying any column names, which can lead to errors while copying the data.

To fix this bug, we need to ensure that if column names are provided in `self.columns`, they are included in the `COPY` command.

Here is the corrected version of the function:
```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,  # Including colnames in the query
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

This corrected version ensures that if column names are provided, they are included in the `COPY` command, otherwise an empty string will be used. This should fix the bug and ensure that the `COPY` command works correctly with the provided input parameters and expected values.
