The bug in the provided code is likely causing an error due to the format of the COPY query string being incorrect. The placeholders for colnames and credentials might not be correctly filled, leading to a syntax error in the query.

To fix this bug, we should ensure that the placeholders in the COPY query string are properly formatted and filled with the corresponding values.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS 'aws_access_key_id={access_key};aws_secret_access_key={secret_key}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        access_key=self.access_key,
        secret_key=self.secret_key,
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

Make sure to replace `{access_key}` and `{secret_key}` with the actual values of your AWS access key ID and secret access key.

This corrected version should now properly format the COPY query string and execute it without any syntax errors.
