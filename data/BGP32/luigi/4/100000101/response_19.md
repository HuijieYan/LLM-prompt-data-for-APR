The bug in the provided function is likely caused by missing single quotes around the table name in the SQL query being executed. This can lead to a syntax error when running the `COPY` command on Redshift.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the table name is properly enclosed in single quotes in the SQL query.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
    COPY "{table}" {colnames} from '{source}'
    CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
    {options}
    ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

In the corrected version, we have added double quotes around the `{table}` placeholder in the SQL query to ensure that the table name is properly enclosed. This should prevent any syntax errors when executing the `COPY` command on Redshift.
