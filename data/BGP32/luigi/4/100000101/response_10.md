The bug in the provided function is related to the `'source'` parameter in the `cursor.execute` statement. The `'source'` parameter is directly passed the value of the variable `f`, which is expected to be the S3 path. However, the S3 path should be enclosed within single quotes in the SQL query string. 

To fix this bug, we need to modify the `source=f` part in the `cursor.execute` statement to `'source=''{source}'''.format(source=f)`.

Here is the corrected version of the function:
```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: luigi/contrib/redshift.py

def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source='''{f}'''.format(f=f),
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

This corrected version ensures that the S3 path in the SQL query string is properly enclosed within single quotes, which is necessary for the query to execute correctly.
