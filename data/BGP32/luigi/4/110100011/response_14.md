## Analysis:
1. The buggy function `copy` in the `S3CopyToTable` class within `redshift.py` file is failing when `self.columns` is `None`.
2. The failing test `test_s3_copy_with_nonetype_columns` is mocking the `cursor.execute` call for the `COPY` statement with `colnames` as `''` which reflects the bug in the function.
3. The GitHub issue highlights the root cause as the check for `len(self.columns)` causing the `TypeError` when `self.columns` is `None`.
4. The suggested solution is to change the condition to `if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0`.

## Bug Cause:
The bug is caused by directly trying to access the length of `self.columns` without checking if it is `None` or not. When `self.columns` is `None`, it raises a `TypeError`.

## Strategy for Fixing:
To fix the bug, we need to modify the condition to first check if `self.columns` is not `None` and then proceed to check the length.

## Corrected Version:
```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.
    
    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

By making the above change in the `copy` function, it will now first check if `self.columns` is not `None` before trying to access its length, hence fixing the bug reported in the GitHub issue.
