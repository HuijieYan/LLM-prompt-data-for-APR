## Analysis:
The buggy function `copy` in the `S3CopyToTable` class within the `luigi/contrib/redshift.py` file is failing when `columns` is set to `None`. It is throwing a `TypeError: object of type 'NoneType' has no len()` because it tries to check the length of `self.columns` without verifying if it is not `None` before doing so.

The test function `test_s3_copy_with_nonetype_columns` in `test/contrib/redshift_test.py` is verifying the behavior when `columns` is `None` by mocking the behavior of the `RedshiftTarget` and checking the executed SQL statement.

The GitHub issue highlights that the bug was introduced in version 2.7.1 of Luigi due to a specific line of code that checks the length of `self.columns` without verifying if it is not `None`.

## Bug Cause:
The buggy function `copy` in `S3CopyToTable` class is directly accessing the length of `self.columns` without checking if it is `None` first. This causes the `TypeError` when `columns` is set to `None`.

## Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to modify the line where the length of `self.columns` is checked to first verify that `self.columns` is not `None` before attempting to get its length. By adding an additional condition to check for `self.columns` before checking its length, we can avoid the `TypeError` when `columns` is `None`.

## Corrected Version:
```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
``` 

By adding the `if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:` condition before trying to access the length of `self.columns`, we ensure that the code only checks the length when `self.columns` is not `None`. This modification will fix the bug and the corrected version should now pass the failing test and resolve the issue reported on GitHub.
