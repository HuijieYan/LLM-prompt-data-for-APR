### Analysis:
The buggy function `copy` within the `S3CopyToTable` class is failing due to the incorrect handling of the `self.columns` attribute. The failing test `test_s3_copy_with_nonetype_columns` is mocking a scenario where `columns` is `None`, which is causing the bug to surface.

### Error Location:
The error is occurring in the `copy` function when attempting to check the length of `self.columns` without properly handling the scenario where `self.columns` is `None`.

### Cause of the Bug:
The bug occurs because the buggy function does not handle the case where `self.columns` is `None`. When `self.columns` is `None`, attempting to access its length (`len(self.columns)`) results in a `TypeError` as `NoneType` has no length attribute.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to properly handle the scenario where `self.columns` is `None` before attempting to access its length. We can modify the condition check to ensure that `self.columns` is not `None` before checking its length.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:  # Check if self.columns is not None
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

By adding `if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:` before trying to access the length of `self.columns`, we ensure that the bug is fixed by handling the `None` case. This corrected version should pass the failing test and resolve the issue posted in GitHub.
