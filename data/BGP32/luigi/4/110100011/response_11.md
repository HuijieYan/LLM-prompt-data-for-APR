### Analysis:
The buggy function `copy` within the `S3CopyToTable` class in the `luigi/contrib/redshift.py` file is causing an issue when the `columns` attribute is set to `None`. This issue has been reported on GitHub where it fails with a `TypeError` due to trying to get the length of a `NoneType` object.

### Error Location:
The issue is in the following part of the buggy function:
```python
if len(self.columns) > 0:
```
Here, the `self.columns` attribute might be `None`, causing the `TypeError` when trying to get the length.

### Cause of the Bug:
The bug occurs because the buggy function does not handle the case when the `self.columns` attribute is `None`. The failing test provided in the test file `redshift_test.py` attempts to test this scenario, and the bug is triggered when the `columns` are set to `None`.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we should check if `self.columns` is not `None` before trying to get its length. This check will prevent the `TypeError` and ensure that the function behaves correctly even when `columns` are set to `None`.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
Here is the corrected version of the `copy` function within the `S3CopyToTable` class:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns is not None and len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

In this corrected version, we have added a check `if self.columns is not None` before trying to get the length of `self.columns`. This check ensures that the length is only calculated if `self.columns` is not `None`, addressing the bug reported in the GitHub issue.
