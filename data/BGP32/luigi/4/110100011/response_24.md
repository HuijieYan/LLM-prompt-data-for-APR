### Analysis:
- **Buggy Function:** The `copy` function within the `S3CopyToTable` class is responsible for copying data from S3 into Redshift.
- **Relation to Buggy Class:** The `S3CopyToTable` class is a subclass of `rdbms.CopyToTable` and `_CredentialsMixin`, providing functionality for inserting data into Redshift from S3.
- **Test Code:** The failing test `test_s3_copy_with_nonetype_columns` attempts to run the `DummyS3CopyToTableKey` task and expects a `COPY` SQL query to be executed on a mocked cursor object.
- **GitHub Issue:** The issue highlights that providing `columns=None` to prevent table creation leads to a `TypeError` in Luigi 2.7.1 due to a check for the length of `self.columns`.

### Error Location:
- The error seems to occur in the `copy` function when checking the length of `self.columns`.

### Bug Cause:
- The bug is caused by the assumption that `self.columns` will always have a value. When `columns=None` is provided, it leads to `NoneType` and results in a `TypeError`.

### Fix Strategy:
- Modify the condition for checking the existence and length of `self.columns` to avoid the `TypeError` when `columns=None`.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:  # Check if columns exist and have length
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

By updating the condition to check for the existence of `self.columns` before checking its length, the corrected version of the `copy` function should now handle the case where `columns=None` is provided without causing a `TypeError`. This fix should address the issue reported in the GitHub bug.
