## Analysis:
The buggy function `copy` in the `S3CopyToTable` class is failing because it is trying to check the length of `self.columns` without first checking if `self.columns` is not None. This is causing a `TypeError: object of type 'NoneType' has no len()` when `self.columns` is None. The failing test `test_s3_copy_with_nonetype_columns` further confirms the issue by passing `columns=None` to the task.

## Bug Explanation:
- The `columns` attribute in the `S3CopyToTable` class is expected to contain a list of columns, but it can be None if the user wants to prohibit table creation.
- The buggy function `copy` does not handle the case when `self.columns` is None, leading to the failure.
- The failing test is intentionally passing `columns=None` to trigger this specific scenario.
- The GitHub issue suggests a fix by checking if `self.columns` is not None before checking its length.

## Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to add a check to ensure that `self.columns` is not None before trying to access its length. By following the suggestion from the GitHub issue, we can update the code to handle this scenario properly.

## Corrected Version:
```python
    def copy(self, cursor, f):
        """
        Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

        If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
        """
        logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
        colnames = ''
        if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:
            colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
            colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

        cursor.execute("""
         COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
         CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
         {options}
         ;""".format(
            table=self.table,
            colnames=colnames,
            source=f,
            creds=self._credentials(),
            options=self.copy_options)
        )
```

By making this change, the corrected version of the `copy` function should now handle the scenario when `self.columns` is None and pass the failing test case mentioned above, resolving the GitHub issue as well.
