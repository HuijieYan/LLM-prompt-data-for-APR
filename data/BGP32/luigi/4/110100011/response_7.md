## Analysis:
1. The buggy function `copy` in the `S3CopyToTable` class is trying to construct a SQL query for copying data from S3 to Redshift. The issue seems to be related to the handling of the `columns` attribute when it is set to `None`.

2. The bug occurs when the `columns` attribute is `None` and the code tries to calculate the length of `self.columns` without checking if `self.columns` is not `None`. This leads to the `TypeError: object of type 'NoneType' has no len()`.

3. The `test_s3_copy_with_nonetype_columns` test case is trying to test the behavior when `columns` is `None`. Since the `columns` attribute is not provided in the test task `DummyS3CopyToTableKey`, it expects the `colnames` to be empty in the executed SQL query.

4. To fix the bug, we need to modify the code in a way that it handles the case when `self.columns` is `None` gracefully, without trying to calculate the length.

## Bug Fix:
```python
class S3CopyToTable(rdbms.CopyToTable, _CredentialsMixin):
    # Other class code remains unchanged

    def copy(self, cursor, f):
        """
        Defines copying from s3 into redshift.
        
        If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
        """
        logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
        
        colnames = ''
        if self.columns is not None and len(self.columns) > 0:
            colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
            colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)
    
        cursor.execute("""
         COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
         CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
         {options}
         ;""".format(
            table=self.table,
            colnames=colnames,
            source=f,
            creds=self._credentials(),
            options=self.copy_options)
        )
```

By adding a check `if self.columns is not None and len(self.columns) > 0:`, we ensure that the code handles the case when `self.columns` is `None` without causing a `TypeError`. This change aligns with the suggested solution in the GitHub issue.

With this fix, the corrected version of the `copy` function should now work correctly for cases when `columns` is `None`.
