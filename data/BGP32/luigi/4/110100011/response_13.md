### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `copy` in the `S3CopyToTable` class within `luigi/contrib/redshift.py` is responsible for copying data from S3 to Redshift.
2. The failing test `test_s3_copy_with_nonetype_columns` in `test/contrib/redshift_test.py` mocks the required objects and checks if the COPY statement is executed correctly.
3. The GitHub issue mentions that when `columns` are `None`, the job fails due to a `TypeError` caused by trying to get the length of `self.columns`.
4. The suggested solution in the GitHub issue is to check if `self.columns` exists and has a length before trying to access its length.
  
### Bug Explanation:
The buggy function `copy` accesses `len(self.columns)` directly without checking if `self.columns` is `None`. This results in a `TypeError` when `self.columns` is `None`, as it does not have a length attribute.

### Strategy for Fixing:
To fix the bug, we should modify the condition `if len(self.columns) > 0` to `if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0` to ensure `self.columns` is not `None` before accessing its length.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from S3 into Redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

The corrected version includes the suggested condition `if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0` before accessing the length of `self.columns`. This fix should resolve the `TypeError` issue when `columns` are `None`.
