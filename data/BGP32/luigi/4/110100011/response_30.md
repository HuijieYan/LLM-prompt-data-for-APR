Looking at the buggy function `copy` in the `S3CopyToTable` class from the `luigi.contrib.redshift.py` file, the potential error location is identified in this line:
```python
colnames = ''
if len(self.columns) > 0:
```
The bug occurs when `self.columns` is `None`, resulting in a `TypeError: object of type 'NoneType' has no len()`.

The bug is related to the GitHub issue where the user is trying to run Redshift COPY jobs with `columns` set to `None` to prevent table creation but encounters the mentioned `TypeError`.

To fix this bug and address the issue, we can modify the condition to check if `self.columns` exists and is not `None` before checking its length:
```python
if self.columns is not None and len(self.columns) > 0:
```

Here is the corrected version of the `copy` function:
```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns is not None and len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

With this correction, the `copy` function should now handle the case where `self.columns` is `None` without raising any errors and pass the failing test related to the GitHub issue.
