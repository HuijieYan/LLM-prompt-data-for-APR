### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `copy` is within the `S3CopyToTable` class in the `luigi/contrib/redshift.py` file.
2. The function is responsible for executing a `COPY` command from S3 into Redshift.
3. The failing test `test_s3_copy_with_nonetype_columns` in `test/contrib/redshift_test.py` confirms that the bug occurs when `columns` is `None`.
4. The GitHub issue highlights that the bug originates from checking the length of `self.columns` without verifying if it is `None`.

### Error Location:
The bug occurs when attempting to get the length of `self.columns` without first checking if `self.columns` is not `None`.

### Cause of the Bug:
The bug is caused by directly checking the length of `self.columns` without considering the case when `self.columns` is `None`. This leads to the `TypeError: object of type 'NoneType' has no len()` when `columns` is `None`.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to modify the condition to first check if `self.columns` is not `None` before attempting to get its length.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:  # Check if self.columns is not None before getting its length
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

By adding the check `if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0`, we ensure that the length of `self.columns` is only checked when it is not `None`. This correction should resolve the bug and make the function work correctly when `columns` is `None`.
