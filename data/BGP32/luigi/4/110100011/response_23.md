### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `copy` within the `S3CopyToTable` class in the `luigi/contrib/redshift.py` file is responsible for executing a `COPY` command from an S3 source into Redshift.
2. The buggy function attempts to construct a SQL query string using attributes like `table`, `colnames`, `source`, `creds`, and `copy_options`.
3. The bug is related to the usage of `self.columns` to construct `colnames`, which leads to a `TypeError` when `self.columns` is `None`. This issue is reported in the GitHub issue titled "Redshift COPY fails in luigi 2.7.1 when columns are not provided".
4. To fix the bug, we need to ensure that `self.columns` is checked for existence before trying to access its length.

### Bug Cause:
The bug occurs because the buggy function assumes `self.columns` will always have a value, leading to an error when it is `None`.

### Bug Fix:
To fix the bug, we need to update the condition checking for the existence and length of `self.columns`. We can modify the line to check if `self.columns` is not None before trying to access its length.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

By making this change, the corrected version of the `copy` function will properly handle cases where `self.columns` is `None`, resolving the bug reported in the GitHub issue.
