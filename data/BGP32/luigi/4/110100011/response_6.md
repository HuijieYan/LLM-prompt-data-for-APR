Based on the information provided above, the bug in the `copy` function of the `S3CopyToTable` class arises when the `columns` attribute is `None`. This causes a `TypeError` because the buggy code does not handle this scenario and tries to get the length of `None`.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the line that checks the length of `self.columns`. Instead of checking if the length is greater than 0, we should first check if `self.columns` is not `None`.

Here is the corrected version of the `copy` function:

```python
    def copy(self, cursor, f):
        """
        Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

        If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
        """
        logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
        colnames = ''
        if self.columns is not None:
            colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
            colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

        cursor.execute("""
         COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
         CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
         {options}
         ;""".format(
            table=self.table,
            colnames=colnames,
            source=f,
            creds=self._credentials(),
            options=self.copy_options)
        )
```

With this correction, the function will check if `self.columns` is not `None` before trying to get its length.

This fix will address the bug reported in the GitHub issue related to Redshift COPY failing in luigi 2.7.1 when columns are not provided.
