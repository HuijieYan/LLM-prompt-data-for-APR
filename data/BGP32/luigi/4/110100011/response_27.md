### Analysis:
- The buggy function `copy` is part of the `S3CopyToTable` class in the `luigi/contrib/redshift.py` file.
- The failing test `test_s3_copy_with_nonetype_columns` in `test/contrib/redshift_test.py` checks for the behavior when `columns` is `None`.
- The bug is related to the use of `self.columns` without checking if it is `None`.
- The GitHub issue explains that passing `columns = None` causes a `TypeError` due to the assumption that it is a list without checking for `None`.

### Bug Cause:
The bug occurs because the `copy` function assumes `self.columns` is always a list without checking if it is `None`. This causes a `TypeError` when trying to get the length of `None`.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we should add a check to ensure that `self.columns` is not `None` before getting its length. If `self.columns` is `None`, we should handle it appropriately without trying to access its length.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns is not None and len(self.columns) > 0:  # Fix: Added check for None
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

By adding the check `if self.columns is not None and len(self.columns) > 0:`, we ensure that the code handles the scenario where `self.columns` is `None` correctly. This corrected version should resolve the `TypeError` issue mentioned in the GitHub bug report.
