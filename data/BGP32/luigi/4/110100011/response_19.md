## Analysis:
1. The buggy function `copy` within the `S3CopyToTable` class is responsible for executing the `COPY` command in Redshift.
2. The bug seems to be related to the handling of the `columns` attribute. When `self.columns` is None, the code throws a `TypeError` because it attempts to call `len()` on a NoneType object.
3. The failing test `test_s3_copy_with_nonetype_columns` mocks the scenario where `columns` is set to None and expects the `COPY` command to be executed with empty `colnames`.
4. The GitHub issue highlights the crash when `columns` is None and suggests a solution by checking if `self.columns` is truthy before checking its length.
5. To fix the bug, we need to modify the `copy` function to handle the case when `self.columns` is None gracefully.

## Bug Fix Strategy:
- Modify the `copy` function to explicitly check if `self.columns` is not None before trying to access its length.
- Update the `colnames` variable assignment to handle the case when `self.columns` is None.

## Corrected Version:
```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames) if colnames else ''

    cursor.execute(
    """
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

Now, with this corrected version, the `copy` function should handle the case when `columns` is None gracefully and pass the failing test scenario.
