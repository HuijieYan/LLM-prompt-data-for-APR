## Analysis:
1. The buggy function `copy` in the `S3CopyToTable` class is failing when `self.columns` is set to `None`.
2. The root cause of the bug seems to be related to the check for the length of `self.columns` without checking if it is `None`.
3. The failing test `test_s3_copy_with_nonetype_columns` is testing the behavior of the `copy` function when `self.columns` is `None`.
4. According to the GitHub issue, the bug is triggered when `self.columns` is `None` due to a missing check before getting the length of columns. The proposed solution is to add a check `if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0` instead of just `if len(self.columns) > 0`.

## Bug Cause:
The bug is caused by directly checking the length of `self.columns` without validating if `self.columns` is not `None`. When `self.columns` is `None`, it results in a `TypeError` because `NoneType` has no length.

## Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to modify the condition where we check the length of `self.columns` to first ensure that `self.columns` is not `None` before checking its length.

## Corrected Version:
```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:  # Fix: Check if self.columns is not None
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

By adding the check `if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0`, we ensure that the length is only checked when `self.columns` is not `None`, thus preventing the `TypeError` when `self.columns` is `None`.
