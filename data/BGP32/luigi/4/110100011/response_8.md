## Analysis:
The buggy function in the `S3CopyToTable` class of `luigi/contrib/redshift.py` is causing an issue when `self.columns` is set to `None`. The buggy function `copy` is trying to access the length of `self.columns` without checking if it is not `None`, leading to a `TypeError`. The failing test `test_s3_copy_with_nonetype_columns` is validating the behavior when `columns` are set to `None`.

The GitHub issue indicates that the root cause of the bug is due to the lack of check for `None` in `self.columns` before attempting to get its length.

## Error Location:
The error occurs in the line:
```python
if len(self.columns) > 0:
```
where `self.columns` is assumed to be not `None`.

## Bug Cause:
The bug is caused by the assumption that `self.columns` is always a list or iterable, leading to an error when it is set to `None`. The failing test case `test_s3_copy_with_nonetype_columns` specifically tests this scenario.

## Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to add a check to ensure that `self.columns` is not `None` before attempting to get its length. This will prevent the `TypeError` when `columns` are set to `None`.

## Corrected Version:
```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

By adding the check `if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:` we ensure that `self.columns` is not `None` before attempting to access its length. This corrected version should pass the failing test and resolve the issue reported on GitHub.
