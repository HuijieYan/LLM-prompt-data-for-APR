## Analysis:
1. The buggy function `copy` within the `S3CopyToTable` class from `luigi/contrib/redshift.py` is responsible for copying data from S3 to Redshift.
2. The bug occurs due to the function assuming that `self.columns` is always provided and attempting to access its length without checking if it's `None` or empty.
3. The failing test `test_s3_copy_with_nonetype_columns` calls the `copy` function with `columns=None` which triggers the bug. The GitHub issue confirms that this behavior causes a `TypeError`.
4. To fix the bug, we need to check if `self.columns` is not None before attempting to access its length in the `copy` function.

## Suggestions for Fixing the Bug:
1. Modify the `copy` function to check if `self.columns` is not None before proceeding to extract column names.
2. Add a conditional check to handle the scenario where `columns` is provided as `None` to prevent the `TypeError`.

## Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from S3 into Redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:  # Check if columns are provided and not None
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

By incorporating the change mentioned above in the corrected version of the `copy` function, the bug will be fixed and the failing test `test_s3_copy_with_nonetype_columns` will pass.
