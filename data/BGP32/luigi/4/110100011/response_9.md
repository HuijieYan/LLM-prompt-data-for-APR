### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `copy` belongs to the `S3CopyToTable` class in the `luigi/contrib/redshift.py` file.
2. The failing test `test_s3_copy_with_nonetype_columns` in `test/contrib/redshift_test.py` tries to test the behavior of the `copy` function when `columns` is set to `None`.
3. The GitHub issue highlights that the bug occurs when `columns` is `None`, leading to a `TypeError` due to `len(None)`.
4. The suggested solution in the GitHub issue recommends modifying the condition to check if `self.columns` is not `None` before checking its length.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is caused by directly checking the length of `self.columns` without verifying if it is `None` first. When `columns` is `None`, the code attempts to get the length of `None` which results in a `TypeError`.

### Fix Strategy:
Modify the code to first check if `self.columns` is not `None` before checking its length to avoid the `TypeError`.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:  # Check if self.columns is not None before getting length
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

By making this change, the corrected version of the function will now properly handle the case when `columns` is `None` without causing a `TypeError`. This correction will address the bug reported in the GitHub issue and allow the failing test to pass successfully.
