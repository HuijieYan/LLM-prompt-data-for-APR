### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `copy` within the `S3CopyToTable` class in `redshift.py` file of the `luigi` library is failing to handle the case when `self.columns` is `None`.
2. The failing test `test_s3_copy_with_nonetype_columns` is mocking the `cursor.execute` call and expects an SQL string without column names (`colnames`) when `self.columns` is `None`.
3. The bug causes a `TypeError: object of type 'NoneType' has no len()` when trying to get the length of `self.columns` if it is `None`, which fails the test case.
4. The suggested solution from the GitHub issue is to check if `self.columns` is not `None` before checking its length to avoid the `TypeError`.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we will update the condition to check if `self.columns` is not `None` before processing it to construct the `colnames` part of the SQL query.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

By updating the `if self.columns` condition in the `copy` function, we can ensure that the code handles the case where `self.columns` is `None` correctly and constructs the SQL query as expected. This correction should resolve the bug reported in the GitHub issue and make the failing test pass successfully.
