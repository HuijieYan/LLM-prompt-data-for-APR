### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `copy()` is part of the `S3CopyToTable` class in the `luigi.contrib.redshift` module.
2. The function is responsible for copying data from S3 into Redshift.
3. The bug seems to be related to the way it handles checking the length of columns.
4. The failing test `test_s3_copy_with_nonetype_columns` is mocking the `RedshiftTarget` object and checking if the `COPY` statement executed correctly.
5. The GitHub issue highlights that the bug occurs when `columns` are set to `None`.

### Bug Cause:
The bug occurs because the `copy()` function does not handle the case when `self.columns` is `None`. This results in a `TypeError` when trying to get the length of `None`.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to modify the conditional check for `self.columns` to ensure it is not `None` before attempting to get its length.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:  # Check if self.columns is not None before getting its length
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

By adding the `if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0` check, we ensure that the code only proceeds when `self.columns` is not `None`. This corrected version should resolve the bug and pass the failing test.
