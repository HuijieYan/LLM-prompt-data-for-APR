## Analysis:
1. The provided buggy function `copy` in the `S3CopyToTable` class is responsible for inserting data into Redshift from S3.
2. The bug occurs when the `columns` attribute is set to `None`, resulting in a `TypeError` due to calling `len` on a `NoneType`.
3. The failing test `test_s3_copy_with_nonetype_columns` verifies that the `COPY` statement is formatted correctly and expects an empty `colnames` when `columns` is `None`.
4. The GitHub issue indicates that the bug was introduced in version 2.7.1 and suggests changing the condition to `if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:` as a possible solution.

## Bug:
The bug occurs in the `S3CopyToTable.copy` function when the `columns` attribute is set to `None`. The code does not handle this case properly and results in a `TypeError`.

## Fix:
To fix the bug, we need to modify the condition checking the length of `self.columns` to handle the case when it is `None`. We should update the condition as suggested in the GitHub issue.

## Corrected Version:
```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.
    
    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

By updating the condition to check if `self.columns` is not `None` before checking its length, we can avoid the `TypeError` when `columns` is `None`. This corrected version should fix the bug and pass the failing test.
