### Analysis:
The buggy function `copy` in the `S3CopyToTable` class in `redshift.py` fails when `self.columns` is `None`. The `copy` function is trying to access the length of `self.columns` without checking if it is `None` or not. This issue was reported in a GitHub Issue where it was observed that running Redshift COPY jobs with `columns = None` fails due to a `TypeError`.

### Error Location:
The error is likely occurring on the line:
```python
if len(self.columns) > 0:
```
when `self.columns` is `None`.

### Cause of the Bug:
The bug is caused because the code does not check if `self.columns` is `None` before trying to access its length. This results in a `TypeError` when trying to get the length of `None`.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to first check if `self.columns` is not `None` before trying to access its length. If `self.columns` is `None`, we can assume that there are no columns provided and skip constructing the column names string.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

The corrected version checks if `self.columns` is not `None` before accessing its length. This will prevent the `TypeError` when `self.columns` is `None`.
