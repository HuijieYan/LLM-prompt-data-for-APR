### Analysis:
- The error message indicates a `TypeError` on line 338 of the `luigi/contrib/redshift.py` file.
- The error occurs when trying to check the length of `self.columns` which is `None`.

### Bug:
- The bug occurs because the function is trying to check the length of `self.columns` without handling the case when `self.columns` is `None`.

### Fix:
- To fix the bug, we need to add a check to ensure `self.columns` is not `None` before trying to get its length.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns is not None and len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

### Note:
The corrected version checks if `self.columns` is not `None` before attempting to get its length, preventing the `TypeError` that was raised in the buggy version.
