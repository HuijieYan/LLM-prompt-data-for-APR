### Analysis:
The error message indicates a `TypeError` at line 356 of the `luigi/contrib/redshift.py` file. Specifically, it points out that an object of type `NoneType` has no length. This error occurs when trying to check the length of `self.columns` when it is `None`, which is not allowed.

### Bug Location:
The buggy function is located in the `copy` method where it tries to check the length of `self.columns`.

### Cause of the Bug:
The bug occurs because the function is not handling the case where `self.columns` is `None`. This causes a `TypeError` when trying to determine the length of `None`.

### Fix Strategy:
To fix this bug, we need to handle the case where `self.columns` is `None` before attempting to get its length. One way to do this is to check if `self.columns` is `None` at the beginning of the function and set `colnames` accordingly.

### Corrected Version:
Below is the corrected version of the `copy` function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns is not None:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

This corrected version checks if `self.columns` is not `None` before attempting to get its length, preventing the `TypeError` that was occurring previously.
