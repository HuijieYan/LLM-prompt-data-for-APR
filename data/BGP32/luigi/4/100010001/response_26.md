### Analysis:
- The error message indicates a `TypeError` at line 356 of the `luigi/contrib/redshift.py` file.
- The error occurs due to attempting to perform `len()` on a `NoneType` object (self.columns).

### Bug:
The buggy function does not check if `self.columns` is `None` before trying to access its length. If `self.columns` is `None` (as is the case in the failing test), then the `len()` operation will raise a `TypeError`.

### Fix:
To fix the bug, we need to add a check to ensure that `self.columns` is not `None` before attempting to access its length.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns is not None and len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

By adding the check `if self.columns is not None and len(self.columns) > 0`, we ensure that the code only tries to access the length of `self.columns` if it is not `None`. This modification will prevent the `TypeError` that was occurring previously when `self.columns` was `None`.
