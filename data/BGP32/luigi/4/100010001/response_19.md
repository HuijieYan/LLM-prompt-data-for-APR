### Analysis:
The error message indicated that a `TypeError` was raised due to the `if len(self.columns) > 0:` condition in the `copy` function. The error occurred because `self.columns` was set to `None`, which caused the comparison `len(self.columns) > 0` to fail since `None` does not have a length.

### Bug Cause:
The bug was caused by `self.columns` being set to `None` when it should have been an empty list `[]`. This error occurred during the condition check `if len(self.columns) > 0:` which led to the `TypeError`.

### Bug Fix:
To fix this bug, we need to ensure that `self.columns` is correctly handled as an empty list `[]` when no columns are provided. This way, the comparison `if len(self.columns) > 0:` will work as expected without raising any errors.

### Corrected Version:
Here is the corrected version of the `copy` function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

By checking `if self.columns` directly in the condition, we can handle the case where `self.columns` is `None` and avoid the `TypeError`.
