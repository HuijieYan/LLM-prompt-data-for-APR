The error message indicates a `TypeError` due to attempting to take the length of `NoneType` object in the `if len(self.columns) > 0` condition. This means that `self.columns` is `None`, hence causing the error.

To fix this bug, we need to handle the case where `self.columns` is None by adding a check to verify if `self.columns` is not None before trying to access its length. If `self.columns` is None, we can set `colnames` to an empty string to avoid the error.

Here's the corrected version of the `copy` function:

```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: luigi/contrib/redshift.py

def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns is not None and len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

With this modification, the function will check if `self.columns` is not `None` before checking its length, thus preventing the `TypeError` encountered when `self.columns` is `None`.
