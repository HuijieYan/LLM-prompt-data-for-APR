The bug in the provided function is caused by trying to call `len()` on a `None` type object when checking the length of `self.columns`. This results in a `TypeError` when trying to compare the length of a `None` object.

To fix this bug, we need to add a check to ensure that `self.columns` is not `None` before attempting to retrieve its length. This can be done using an `if` statement to handle the case where `self.columns` is `None`.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns is not None and len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

With this correction, the function will first check if `self.columns` is not `None` before trying to get its length. This will prevent the `TypeError` that was occurring previously. The corrected function should now pass the failing test.
