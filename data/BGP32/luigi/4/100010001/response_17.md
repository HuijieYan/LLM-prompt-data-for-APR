The bug in this function is caused by checking the length of a NoneType object directly in the `if` condition on line 338 of the `copy` function. When `self.columns` is `None`, trying to get the length of it using `len(self.columns)` results in a `TypeError`.

To fix this bug, you can check if `self.columns` is `None` before trying to get its length. If it is not `None`, then proceed with the rest of the logic. Otherwise, handle the `None` case accordingly.

Here is the corrected version of the `copy` function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    
    if self.columns is not None:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

With this change, the function will first check if `self.columns` is not `None` before attempting to calculate its length, which should prevent the `TypeError` from occurring.
