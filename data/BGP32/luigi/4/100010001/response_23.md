### Analysis:
The buggy function `copy` is failing with a `TypeError` when trying to check the length of `self.columns` because it is being compared to `0` but `self.columns` is `None`.

### Bug:
The bug is caused due to the `if len(self.columns) > 0:` condition which is checking the length of `self.columns` without handling the case when `self.columns` is `None`.

### Fix:
To fix the bug, we need to handle the case when `self.columns` is `None` before checking its length.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns is not None:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

By adding a check `if self.columns is not None:` before trying to access the length of `self.columns`, we are ensuring that the code does not throw a `TypeError` in case `self.columns` is `None`.
