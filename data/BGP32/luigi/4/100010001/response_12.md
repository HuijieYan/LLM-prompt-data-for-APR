The error message is indicating a `TypeError` due to the fact that the function is trying to retrieve the length of `self.columns`, which is `None`. This happens when `columns` is set to `None` in the `DummyS3CopyToTableKey` instance.

To fix this bug, we need to handle the case where `columns` is `None` before trying to access its length. We can do this by checking if `self.columns` is `None` before attempting to get its length.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

By checking if `self.columns` is not `None` before accessing its length, we avoid the `TypeError` that was previously occurring. This corrected version should address the bug and allow the function to run without any errors.
