### Analysis:
The error message `TypeError: object of type 'NoneType' has no len()` indicates that the `self.columns` is `None` which is causing the `TypeError` when trying to check its length.

### Identified potential error location:
The potential error location causing the issue is the condition `if len(self.columns) > 0:` which directly depends on the `self.columns`.

### Cause of the Bug:
The bug is caused by passing `None` as the value for the `columns` parameter of the `DummyS3CopyToTableKey` instance. This results in `self.columns` being `None`, which cannot be used in a length check causing the `TypeError`.

### Strategy for fixing the bug:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the `self.columns` parameter is never `None` before checking its length. We can include a check before processing `self.columns` to handle the case where it might be `None`.

### Corrected Version:
Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

By adding the check `if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:` before processing `self.columns`, we ensure that even if `self.columns` is `None`, it won't cause a `TypeError`.
