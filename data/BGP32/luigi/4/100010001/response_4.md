### Analysis:
- The error message indicates a `TypeError` on line 338 of `luigi/contrib/redshift.py` in the `copy` function.
- The error occurs due to attempting to call `len()` on a variable that is `NoneType`.

### Bug Cause:
- The bug occurs because the `columns` attribute is being set to `None`, causing an error when checking its length using `len()`.

### Bug Fix:
- To fix the bug, we can add a check to ensure that `self.columns` is not `None` before trying to get its length.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns is not None:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
``` 

By adding a check on `self.columns` for `None`, we prevent the `TypeError` and ensure that the corrected function works as expected.
