### Analysis:
The error message `TypeError: object of type 'NoneType' has no len()` indicates that the `self.columns` variable is of type `NoneType` which is causing the error when trying to call `len()` on it.

### Potential Error Location:
The potential error location is in the `copy` function where the `len()` function is being called on `self.columns` without any check for `None`.

### Cause of the Bug:
The bug is caused by the `self.columns` variable being `None` instead of a list. This could be due to not providing any columns during task initialization.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix this bug, we need to check if `self.columns` is `None` before trying to call the `len()` function on it.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:  # Check if self.columns is not None and has length greater than 0
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

By adding the check `if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:`, we ensure that `self.columns` is not `None` before trying to access its length. This should fix the bug and allow the function to run successfully even when `self.columns` is `None`.
