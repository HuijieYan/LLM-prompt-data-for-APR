### Analysis:
The error occurs at line 338 where the function is trying to check the length of `self.columns`, but since `self.columns` is set to `None`, when it tries to use the `len()` function on a `NoneType`, it raises a `TypeError`.

### Bug:
The bug is caused by `self.columns` being set to `None`, which leads to a `TypeError` when trying to get the length of `None`.

### Fix:
To fix the bug, we need to add a check to ensure that `self.columns` is not `None` before trying to get its length.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:  # Add a check to ensure self.columns is not None
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
