### Analysis:
The error message indicates that there is a `TypeError: object of type 'NoneType' has no len()` occurring when trying to check the length of `self.columns` in the `copy` function. This error occurs because the `columns` attribute is `None`, and we cannot check the length of `None`.

### Bug Location:
The bug is located in the `copy` function where it attempts to check the length of `self.columns`.

### Cause of the Bug:
The bug is caused by the fact that the `columns` attribute is `None`, and the function is trying to get the length of `None`, resulting in a `TypeError`.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to handle the case where `self.columns` is `None` properly before trying to access its length. This can be done by adding a check to see if `self.columns` is `None`, and if it is, handle the case accordingly.

### Corrected Version:
Here is the corrected version of the `copy` function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    
    if self.columns is not None and len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

With this change, the function first checks if `self.columns` is not `None` before attempting to get its length. If `self.columns` is `None`, it will skip this block of code and not try to access the length of `None`, thereby avoiding the `TypeError`.
