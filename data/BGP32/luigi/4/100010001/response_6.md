### Analysis:
1. The error message indicates a `TypeError` on line 338 of the `luigi/contrib/redshift.py` file, specifically when attempting to check the length of `self.columns`.
2. The error occurs because `self.columns` is potentially `None`, resulting in a `NoneType` error when trying to use `len()` on it.
3. The `self.columns` variable is not properly handled to check for `None` values before operating on it.
4. A strategy to fix this bug would involve checking if `self.columns` is `None` before attempting to access its length. This can be done by adding a condition to check for this scenario.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns is not None and len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

With this correction, the function will first check if `self.columns` is not `None` before trying to access its length. This will prevent the `TypeError` from occurring when the length of `None` is attempted to be calculated.
