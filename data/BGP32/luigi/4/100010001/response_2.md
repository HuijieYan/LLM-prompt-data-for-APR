### Analysis:
1. The error message indicates a `TypeError` occurring in the `copy` function at line 356 in `luigi/contrib/redshift.py`.
2. The error is due to the expression `len(self.columns)` where `self.columns` is `None`.
3. The `TypeError` occurs because `self.columns` is `None` and calling `len(None)` is not valid.
4. To fix this bug, we need to check if `self.columns` is not `None` before trying to get its length.

### Bug Fix:
```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:  # Check if self.columns is not None before getting its length
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

By adding the condition `if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0`, we are ensuring that `self.columns` is not `None` before trying to get its length, thus avoiding the `TypeError` that occurred. This fix will handle the case where `self.columns` is `None` appropriately.
