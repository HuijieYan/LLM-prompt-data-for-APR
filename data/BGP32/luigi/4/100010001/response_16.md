### Analysis:
The error message is a `TypeError` with the message "object of type 'NoneType' has no len()". This error occurs on line 338 in the `copy` function when trying to check the length of `self.columns`.

### Potential Error Locations:
The error is likely due to the `columns` parameter being `None` in the `DummyS3CopyToTableKey` instance, leading to the `NoneType` error when trying to get the length of `self.columns`.

### Cause of the Bug:
The bug is caused by the `if len(self.columns) > 0:` line in the `copy` function, where `self.columns` is `None`, and trying to get the length of `None` throws a `TypeError`.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we should check if `self.columns` is `None` before trying to get its length. If `self.columns` is `None`, then we can default `colnames` to an empty string.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    if self.columns is None:
        colnames = ''
    else:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

In the corrected version, we check if `self.columns` is `None` before trying to access its length. If it is `None`, we set `colnames` to an empty string. This way, we avoid the `TypeError` when `self.columns` is `None`.
