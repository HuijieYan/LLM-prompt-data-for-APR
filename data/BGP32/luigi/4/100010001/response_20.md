### Analysis:
1. The error message indicates a `TypeError` in the `copy` function in the file `luigi/contrib/redshift.py`.
2. The error is caused by trying to get the length of `self.columns`, which is `None`.
3. The buggy function is attempting to check the length of `self.columns` without handling the case where it might be `None`, resulting in a `TypeError`.
4. To fix the bug, we need to first check if `self.columns` is `None` before attempting to get its length.

### Correction:
Here is the corrected version of the `copy` function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns is not None and len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

With this correction, the `copy` function will check if `self.columns` is `None` before attempting to get its length, preventing the `TypeError` from occurring. This corrected version should now pass the failing test scenario.
