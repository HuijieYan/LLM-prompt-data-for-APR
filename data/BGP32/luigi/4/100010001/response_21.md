The issue in the buggy function is that it assumes `self.columns` will always be a list, but in the failing test case `columns` is `None`. This leads to a `TypeError` when trying to check the length of `None`.

To fix this issue, we can add a check to handle the case when `self.columns` is `None` before attempting to access its length.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

By adding the `if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:` check, we ensure that the function will only access the length of `self.columns` if it is not `None`. This will prevent the `TypeError` from occurring in cases where `columns` is `None`.
