### Analysis:
The error message indicates a `TypeError` caused by attempting to get the length of a `NoneType` object. This occurs in the buggy function on line 338 where the `if len(self.columns) > 0:` statement is trying to check the length of `self.columns` which is `None`.

### Bug Cause:
The `TypeError` occurs because the `self.columns` parameter is set to `None` and the code does not handle this scenario. The function assumes that `self.columns` will always be a list. 

### Bug Fix:
To fix this bug, we need to add a check to handle the scenario where `self.columns` is `None`. If `self.columns` is `None`, there is no need to process it further. 

### Corrected Function:
```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: luigi/contrib/redshift.py

def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    if self.columns is None:
        colnames = ''
    else:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

By adding a conditional check to handle the `None` case for `self.columns`, the function will now handle the scenario without raising a `TypeError` and should pass the failing test.
