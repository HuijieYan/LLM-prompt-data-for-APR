### Analysis:
The error message indicates that the buggy function is trying to check the length of a variable `self.columns`, which is of type `NoneType`. This results in a `TypeError` when trying to compare the length of `NoneType`.

### Bug Location:
The bug is located in the `copy` function at line 338, where it checks the length of `self.columns`.

### Cause of the Bug:
The bug occurs because the function does not handle the case where `self.columns` is `None`.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to check if `self.columns` is `None` before trying to get its length. If it is `None`, we should handle it accordingly.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

In the corrected version, we added a check `if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:` to ensure that `self.columns` is not `None` before trying to get its length. This will prevent the `TypeError` when `self.columns` is `None`.
