### Analysis:
- The error message indicates a `TypeError` in the `copy` function due to trying to get the length of `self.columns`, which is `NoneType`.
- The condition `if len(self.columns) > 0:` is causing the issue because it attempts to check the length of `None`, resulting in a `TypeError`.
- To fix the bug, we need to add a check to handle the case where `self.columns` is `None`.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
- Add a condition to check if `self.columns` is `None` before attempting to get its length.
- If `self.columns` is `None`, handle it by setting `colnames` to an empty string.
- This way, we can prevent the `TypeError` caused by trying to get the length of `None`.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns is not None:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

By adding a check to handle `NoneType` before trying to get the length of `self.columns`, the bug causing the `TypeError` should be fixed.
