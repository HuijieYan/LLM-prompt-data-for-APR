### Analysis:
1. The error message indicates a `TypeError` at line 356 in the `luigi/contrib/redshift.py` file.
2. The error is caused by trying to get the length of a `NoneType`.
3. The `copy` function is trying to check the length of `self.columns`, which are `None` in this case.
4. To fix the bug, we need to handle the case when `self.columns` is `None` before trying to get its length.

### Strategies for Fixing the Bug:
1. Check if `self.columns` is `None` before getting its length.
2. If `self.columns` is `None`, handle this case to avoid the `TypeError`.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns is not None:  # Check if self.columns is not None
        if len(self.columns) > 0:
            colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
            colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

By adding the `if self.columns is not None:` check before checking the length of `self.columns`, we ensure that the code runs without any `TypeError` when `self.columns` is `None`.
