### Analysis:
The error message `TypeError: object of type 'NoneType' has no len()` indicates that the `self.columns` attribute is of type `None` and cannot be used to check its length in the `copy` function. This causes the program to throw a `TypeError` when trying to access the length property on a NoneType object.

### Bug Location:
The bug is located in the `if len(self.columns) > 0:` line inside the `copy` function.

### Cause of the Bug:
The cause of the bug is that the `columns` attribute passed to the `DummyS3CopyToTableKey` constructor is set to `None`, which results in the `self.columns` being of type `NoneType`. Since `NoneType` objects do not have a length property, attempting to access the length of the `self.columns` attribute results in a `TypeError`.

### Bug Fix:
To fix the bug, we need to check if `self.columns` is not `None` before attempting to access its length. We can use a conditional check to handle this situation.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    
    if self.columns is not None:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)
    else:
        colnames = ''

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

With this correction, the `copy` function will first check if `self.columns` is not `None` before processing its content, thus avoiding the `TypeError` that was raised previously.
