### Analysis:
1. The error message indicates a `TypeError` with the message "object of type 'NoneType' has no len()".
2. The line causing the error is `if len(self.columns) > 0:`, where `self.columns` is expected to be a list, but it is currently `None`.
3. The bug occurs because the `columns` attribute of the `DummyS3CopyToTableKey` instance is set to `None`.
4. To fix the bug, we need to handle the case when `columns` is `None` by checking if it's `None` before trying to get its length.

### Correction:
```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:  # Check if self.columns is not None
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
``` 

By adding the condition `if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:`, we ensure that the code will only try to calculate the length of `self.columns` if it is not `None`. This modification will prevent the `TypeError` from occurring when `columns` is set to `None`.
