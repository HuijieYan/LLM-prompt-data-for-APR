### Analysis:
- The error message indicates a `TypeError` related to the use of `len()` function on a `NoneType` object.
- The buggy function tries to check the length of `self.columns` without handling the case where `self.columns` is `None`.
- This is causing the function to raise a `TypeError` when trying to determine the length of a `NoneType` object.

### Bug Cause:
- The buggy function does not handle the scenario where `self.columns` is `None`.
- The code attempts to call `len(self.columns)` directly without checking if `self.columns` is `None` or not.
- When `self.columns` is `None`, trying to get the length of `None` leads to a `TypeError`.

### Fix Strategy:
- To fix the bug, we need to add a check to handle the case where `self.columns` is `None` before trying to get its length.
- By adding a condition to check if `self.columns` is `None`, we can prevent the code from trying to call `len()` on a `NoneType` object.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns is not None:  # Check if self.columns is not None
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

By adding the condition `if self.columns is not None:` before trying to use `len(self.columns)`, we can ensure that the code won't raise a `TypeError` when `self.columns` is `None`.
