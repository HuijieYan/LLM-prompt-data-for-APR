### Analysis
1. The `copy` function in the `S3CopyToTable` class is trying to check the length of `self.columns` which is set to `None` in the failing test case.
2. The error occurs because when `self.columns` is `None`, the code is trying to apply the `len` function on a `NoneType` object.
3. The error message clearly indicates that `'NoneType' has no len()`.
4. To fix this bug, we should first check if `self.columns` is not `None` before trying to calculate its length.

### Solution
Here is the corrected version of the `copy` function in the `S3CopyToTable` class:

```python
    def copy(self, cursor, f):
        """
        Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

        If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
        """
        logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
        
        colnames = ''
        if self.columns is not None and len(self.columns) > 0:
            colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
            colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

        cursor.execute("""
         COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
         CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
         {options}
         ;""".format(
            table=self.table,
            colnames=colnames,
            source=f,
            creds=self._credentials(),
            options=self.copy_options)
        )
```

With this correction, the code first checks if `self.columns` is not `None` before trying to calculate its length. This will prevent the `TypeError` that was occurring in the failing test.
