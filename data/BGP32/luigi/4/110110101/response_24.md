### Analysis
1. The buggy function `copy()` is trying to check the length of `self.columns`, but if `self.columns` is `None`, it will raise a `TypeError`.
2. The error message `object of type 'NoneType' has no len()` indicates that `self.columns` is `None`.
3. The failing test provides the expected input values and the expected SQL string that should be executed by the `cursor`.
4. To fix this bug, we need to handle the case when `self.columns` is `None` by checking if it is `None` before trying to get its length.

### Correction
```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns is not None and len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

By adding a check to see if `self.columns` is not `None` before checking its length, we can prevent the `TypeError` from occurring when `self.columns` is `None`. This correction ensures that the function will still work correctly even when `self.columns` is not provided.
