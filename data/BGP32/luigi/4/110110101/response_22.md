The bug in the `copy` function lies in the conditional check `if len(self.columns) > 0`. The error occurs when `self.columns` is `None`, causing a `TypeError` when trying to get the length of `None`.

To fix this issue, we need to check if `self.columns` is not `None` before getting its length. We can use the `is not None` comparison in the conditional check.

Here is the corrected version of the `copy` function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns is not None:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

This corrected version will handle the case where `self.columns` is `None`, preventing the `TypeError` from occurring.

Ensure to test this corrected function with the failing test case provided to confirm that it now passes without any errors.
