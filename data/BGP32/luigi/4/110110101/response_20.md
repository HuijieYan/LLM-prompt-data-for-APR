### Analysis
1. **Buggy Function**: The `copy` function in the `S3CopyToTable` class is intended to execute a `COPY` command from an S3 source into a Redshift table. The bug occurs when checking the length of `self.columns`, which results in a `TypeError` due to trying to find the length of a `NoneType` object.
   
2. **Error location**: The error occurs in the line:
   ```python
   if len(self.columns) > 0:
   ```
   where `self.columns` is expected to be a list but is `None` in the failing test case.

3. **Cause of the Bug**:
   - **Buggy Function**: The `copy` function assumes that `self.columns` is always a list. However, in the failing test, it is passed as `None`.
   - **Failing Test**: The failing test case creates an instance (`task`) of `DummyS3CopyToTableKey` class with `columns` set to `None`, triggering the bug when `copy` method is called.
   - **Error Message**: The error message indicates a `TypeError` when trying to find the length of a `NoneType` object, which aligns with the analysis.

4. **Strategy for Fixing the Bug**:
   - Check if `self.columns` is `None` before trying to access its length.
   - If `self.columns` is `None`, handle it appropriately or set `colnames` to an empty string.

### Bug-fixed Version
```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns is not None:  # Check if self.columns is not None
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

By adding the check `if self.columns is not None:`, the function will now handle cases where `self.columns` is `None` without raising a `TypeError`.
