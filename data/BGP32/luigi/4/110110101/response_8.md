### Analysis
1. The buggy function `copy` in the `S3CopyToTable` class is attempting to check the length of `self.columns`, which is `None`, causing a `TypeError` when calling `len` on a `NoneType` object.
2. The issue here is that when `self.columns` is `None`, the length should not be checked directly.
3. The failing test is verifying that when `columns` is `None`, the `colnames` variable should be an empty string. The error message indicates that a `TypeError` occurred because `self.columns` is `None`. The expected input/output values demonstrate the correct behavior for this scenario.
4. To fix the bug, we need to handle the case where `self.columns` is `None` separately before trying to access its length.

### Bug Fix
```python
class S3CopyToTable(rdbms.CopyToTable, _CredentialsMixin):
    def copy(self, cursor, f):
        """
        Defines copying from s3 into redshift.
    
        If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
        """
        logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
        colnames = ''
        if self.columns is not None:  # Handle case where columns is None
            colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
            colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)
    
        cursor.execute("""
         COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
         CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
         {options}
         ;""".format(
            table=self.table,
            colnames=colnames,
            source=f,
            creds=self._credentials(),
            options=self.copy_options)
        )
```

With this fix, the `copy` function will first check if `self.columns` is `None`, and if not, it will construct the `colnames` string as before. This approach will prevent the `TypeError` that occurred due to trying to get the length of `None`.
