### Analysis
1. The buggy function `copy` in the `S3CopyToTable` class is trying to check the length of `self.columns`, but in the failing test scenario `columns` is set to `None`, hence causing a `TypeError`.
2. The error is due to the fact that the function is not handling the case when `self.columns` is `None`.
3. The failing test expects the function to handle the case when `self.columns` is `None` and not raise a `TypeError`.
4. To fix the bug, we need to check if `self.columns` is `None` before trying to get its length.

### Bug Fix
Here's the corrected version of the `copy` function in the `S3CopyToTable` class:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:  # Check if self.columns is not None before getting its length
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

By adding the condition `if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0`, we avoid the `TypeError` that was occurring when `self.columns` was `None`. This fix ensures that the function handles the case when `self.columns` is `None` gracefully.
