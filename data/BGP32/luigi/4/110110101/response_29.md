The bug in the provided `copy` function is due to the condition `if len(self.columns) > 0:`, where `self.columns` is None, and trying to get the length of a `NoneType` object raises a `TypeError`. To fix this bug, we need to handle the case where `self.columns` is `None` before checking its length.

Here is the corrected version of the `copy` function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    
    if self.columns is not None and len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

By adding the check `if self.columns is not None:` before checking its length, we ensure that the `TypeError` will not occur when `self.columns` is `None`. This correction addresses the bug and the function should now pass the failing test case provided.

The corrected function ensures that when `self.columns` is `None`, it will not try to calculate its length and directly assign an empty string to `colnames`, thus preventing the `TypeError` from occurring.
