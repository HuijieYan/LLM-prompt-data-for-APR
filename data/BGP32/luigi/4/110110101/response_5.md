### Analysis
The buggy function `copy` in the `S3CopyToTable` class is failing due to the comparison `len(self.columns) > 0` where `self.columns` is of type `None`. This comparison is causing a `TypeError` since `NoneType` does not have a `len` method.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug
To fix the bug, we need to check if `self.columns` is `None` before trying to access its length. If it is `None`, we can assign an empty list to `colnames` to prevent the `TypeError`.

### Corrected Version of the Function
```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

By checking if `self.columns` is not `None` before accessing its length, we prevent the `TypeError` and correctly handle the case where `self.columns` is `None` in the corrected function.
