### Analysis
1. The buggy function `copy` in the `S3CopyToTable` class is trying to handle a case where `self.columns` is `None`, however, it is not properly checking for this case leading to a `TypeError`.
2. The error occurs at the line `if len(self.columns) > 0` because `self.columns` is `None` and cannot be used with the `len()` function.
3. The failing test `test_s3_copy_with_nonetype_columns` creates a `DummyS3CopyToTableKey` object with `columns` set to `None`, and expects an empty `colnames` in the `COPY` SQL query.
4. To fix the bug, we need to check if `self.columns` is not `None` before trying to get its length.
5. A corrected version of the function is provided below.

### Corrected Version
```python
    def copy(self, cursor, f):
        """
        Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

        If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
        """
        logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
        colnames = ''
        if self.columns is not None:  # Check if self.columns is not None
            colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
            colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

        cursor.execute("""
         COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
         CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
         {options}
         ;""".format(
            table=self.table,
            colnames=colnames,
            source=f,
            creds=self._credentials(),
            options=self.copy_options)
        )
```

This corrected version includes a check for `self.columns` being `None` before attempting to get its length. This change will prevent the `TypeError` when `self.columns` is `None`.
