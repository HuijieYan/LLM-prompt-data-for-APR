### Analysis
1. The buggy function is `copy(self, cursor, f)` in the `S3CopyToTable` class.
2. The function is failing due to a `TypeError` caused by attempting to call `len()` on a `NoneType` object.
3. The failing test `test_s3_copy_with_nonetype_columns` is passing `columns=None` to the `DummyS3CopyToTableKey` instance, resulting in `self.columns` being `None`. This leads to the `TypeError` as the code tries to check the length of a `None` object.
4. To fix the bug, we need to handle the case where `self.columns` is `None`.
5. The corrected version of the function is provided below:

### Corrected Version
```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:  # Check if self.columns is not None before accessing its length
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

By checking if `self.columns` is not `None` before trying to access its length, we prevent the `TypeError` when `self.columns` is `None`. This correction ensures that the function can handle `None` values for `self.columns` without throwing an error.
