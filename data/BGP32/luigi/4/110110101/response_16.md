The bug in the provided function `copy` lies in the comparison condition `len(self.columns) > 0` where `self.columns` can be `None`. A `NoneType` object does not have a `len()` method, hence the error `TypeError: object of type 'NoneType' has no len()` occurs.

To fix this bug, you can modify the condition to check if `self.columns` is not `None` before checking its length.

Here is the corrected version of the function `copy`:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    
    if self.columns is not None:  # Check if self.columns is not None
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

This correction ensures that `self.columns` is checked for `None` before attempting to get its length, preventing the `TypeError` from occurring.

After applying this fix, the function should pass the failing test case with the expected input/output values.
