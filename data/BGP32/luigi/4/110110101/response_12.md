### Analysis
1. The `copy` function in the `S3CopyToTable` class expects a non-None value for the `columns` attribute of the class instance. However, in the failing test, the `columns` attribute is set to `None`, leading to a `TypeError` when trying to determine the length of `None`.
2. The error message clearly indicates that the bug is caused by attempting to get the length of a `NoneType` object.

### Bug Cause
When the `columns` attribute of the class instance is `None`, the buggy function tries to determine the length of `None` which results in a `TypeError`.

### Fix
To fix the bug, we need to handle the case where the `columns` attribute is `None` by checking its value before trying to access its length.

### Corrected Version

```python
class S3CopyToTable(rdbms.CopyToTable, _CredentialsMixin):
    def copy(self, cursor, f):
        logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
        colnames = ''
        if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:
            colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
            colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

        cursor.execute("""
         COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
         CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
         {options}
         ;""".format(
            table=self.table,
            colnames=colnames,
            source=f,
            creds=self._credentials(),
            options=self.copy_options)
        )
```

With this correction, the function `copy` will first check if the `columns` attribute is not `None` before trying to access its length, thus avoiding the `TypeError` encountered in the failing test.
