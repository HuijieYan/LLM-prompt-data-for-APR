The buggy function fails due to an error when trying to check the length of a NoneType object (`self.columns`). The `self.columns` attribute is expected to be a list of column names, but in this case, it is None.

To fix this bug, we need to handle the case where `self.columns` is None before attempting to get its length. We can use an if statement to check if `self.columns` is not None before proceeding with the rest of the logic.

Here is the corrected version of the `copy` function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns is not None and len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

By adding the condition `if self.columns is not None and len(self.columns) > 0`, we ensure that the code inside the if block is only executed if `self.columns` is not None and has a length greater than 0. This modification prevents the TypeError that was occurring when `self.columns` was None.

Now, if `self.columns` is None, the `colnames` variable will remain an empty string as expected, and the function should work correctly with the given test case.
