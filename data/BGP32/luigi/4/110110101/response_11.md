### Analysis
1. The buggy function `copy` is trying to check the length of `self.columns`, which is set to `None` in the test case, causing a `TypeError` when trying to check the length of a `NoneType` object.
2. The error message clearly states that a `TypeError` is raised due to trying to get the length of a `NoneType`.
3. The expected behavior is to handle the case when `self.columns` is `None` and set `colnames` to an empty string in that scenario.
4. To fix the bug, we need to check if `self.columns` is not `None` before trying to get its length.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we will modify the code to check if `self.columns` is not `None` before proceeding to get its length. If `self.columns` is `None`, we will set `colnames` to an empty string.

### Corrected Code
```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns is not None:  # Check if self.columns is not None
        if len(self.columns) > 0:
            colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
            colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
``` 

By adding the check `if self.columns is not None:` before the length check, we ensure that the code handles the case when `self.columns` is `None` without raising a `TypeError`. This corrected code should now pass the failing test scenario provided.
