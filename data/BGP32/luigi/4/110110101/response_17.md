### Identification of potential error locations:
1. The error occurs at line 338 where the buggy function tries to check the length of `self.columns`.
2. The `columns` attribute is set to `None` in the test case, resulting in a `NoneType` object being checked for length.
3. This leads to a `TypeError: object of type 'NoneType' has no len()` being raised.

### Bug cause:
1. The buggy function `copy` in the `S3CopyToTable` class is checking the length of `self.columns` without handling the case where `self.columns` is `None`.
2. In the failing test case, `columns=None` is passed to the `DummyS3CopyToTableKey` instance, causing `self.columns` to be `None`.
3. This results in a `TypeError` when trying to check the length of `None`.

### Strategy for fixing the bug:
1. Add a check to handle the case where `self.columns` is `None` in the `copy` function so that it doesn't result in a `TypeError`.
2. Update the logic to handle the scenario where `self.columns` is `None` appropriately.

### The corrected version of the buggy function:
```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

By adding a check `if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0`, we ensure that the length is only checked if `self.columns` is not `None`. This prevents the `TypeError` from occurring and appropriately handles the scenario where `columns` is `None`.
