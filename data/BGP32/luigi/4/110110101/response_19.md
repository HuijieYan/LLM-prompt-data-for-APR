### Strategy for fixing the bug
The error occurs because the code is trying to check the length of `self.columns`, which is set to `None` causing a `TypeError`. To fix this bug, we need to handle the case where `self.columns` is `None` before trying to access its length. We can do this by checking if `self.columns` is not `None` before proceeding to construct `colnames`.

### Corrected version of the buggy function

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns is not None:  # check if self.columns is not None
        if len(self.columns) > 0:
            colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
            colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
``` 

By adding the check `if self.columns is not None`, we ensure that we only attempt to access the length of `self.columns` if it is not `None`. This modification will prevent the `TypeError` that occurred before and the corrected function should now pass the failing test.
