### Analysis
1. The `copy` function in the `S3CopyToTable` class is trying to check the length of `self.columns` without handling the case where `self.columns` is `None`.
2. The failing test is passing `None` to the `columns` parameter of `DummyS3CopyToTableKey`, triggering a `TypeError` when trying to find the length of `None`.
3. The error message clearly indicates that a `TypeError` is raised due to trying to find the length of a `NoneType` object.
4. To fix the bug, we need to handle the case where `self.columns` is `None` before trying to access its length.

### Bug Fixing Strategy
To fix the bug, we will modify the `copy` function to check if `self.columns` is `None` first before trying to get its length. If `self.columns` is not `None`, we will proceed with constructing the `colnames` string.

### Corrected Version of the Function

```python
class S3CopyToTable(rdbms.CopyToTable, _CredentialsMixin):
    """
    Template task for inserting a data set into Redshift from s3.
    
    Usage:
    
    * Subclass and override the required attributes:
    
      * `host`,
      * `database`,
      * `user`,
      * `password`,
      * `table`,
      * `columns`,
      * `s3_load_path`.
    
    * You can also override the attributes provided by the
      CredentialsMixin if they are not supplied by your
      configuration or environment variables.
    """

    def copy(self, cursor, f):
        """
        Defines copying from s3 into redshift.
    
        If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
        """
        logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
        colnames = ''
        
        if self.columns is not None:
            colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
            colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)
    
        cursor.execute("""
         COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
         CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
         {options}
         ;""".format(
            table=self.table,
            colnames=colnames,
            source=f,
            creds=self._credentials(),
            options=self.copy_options)
        )
``` 

After applying this fix, the `copy` function should handle the case where `self.columns` is `None` and avoid the `TypeError` that was previously occurring.
