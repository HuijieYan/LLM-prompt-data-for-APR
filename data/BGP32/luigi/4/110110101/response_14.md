## Bug Analysis
The `TypeError: object of type 'NoneType' has no len()` error occurs in the `copy` function of the `S3CopyToTable` class when `self.columns` is `None`, causing the length check to fail. This error prevents the correct execution of the `COPY` SQL statement, leading to the test failure.

## Bug Fix Strategy
To fix this bug, we need to handle the case when `self.columns` is `None` before attempting to get its length. We can use an `if` statement to check if `self.columns` is not `None` before performing the length check.

## Corrected Function

```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: luigi/contrib/redshift.py

class S3CopyToTable(rdbms.CopyToTable, _CredentialsMixin):
    """
    Template task for inserting a data set into Redshift from s3.
    
    Usage:
    
    * Subclass and override the required attributes:
    
      * `host`,
      * `database`,
      * `user`,
      * `password`,
      * `table`,
      * `columns`,
      * `s3_load_path`.
    
    * You can also override the attributes provided by the
      CredentialsMixin if they are not supplied by your
      configuration or environment variables.
    """


    def copy(self, cursor, f):
        """
        Defines copying from s3 into redshift.
    
        If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
        """
        logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
        colnames = ''
        if self.columns is not None:
            colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
            colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)
    
        cursor.execute("""
         COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
         CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
         {options}
         ;""".format(
            table=self.table,
            colnames=colnames,
            source=f,
            creds=self._credentials(),
            options=self.copy_options)
        )
``` 

This corrected version of the `copy` function includes an `if` statement to handle the case when `self.columns` is `None`, preventing the `TypeError` from occurring. Now, the function should execute properly for both cases when `self.columns` is `None` and when it is not, satisfying the expected input/output values.
