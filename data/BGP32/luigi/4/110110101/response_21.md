### Analysis
1. The buggy function `copy(self, cursor, f)` is trying to check the length of `self.columns` which is passed as `None` in the failing test case.
2. The error message indicates that it's a `TypeError` caused by trying to find the length of a `NoneType` object.
3. The expected behavior is that if `self.columns` is `None`, then `colnames` should be an empty string.
4. The bug can be fixed by adding a check for `None` before trying to find the length of `self.columns`.

### Bug Fix
```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:  # Added a check for None
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

By adding a check for `None` in `if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:`, we ensure that the length is only calculated if `self.columns` is not `None`. This fix will prevent the `TypeError` from occurring when `self.columns` is `None`.
