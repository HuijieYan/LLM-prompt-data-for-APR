## Bug Analysis
1. The buggy function `copy` in the class `S3CopyToTable` of `luigi.contrib.redshift.py` is failing due to a `TypeError` caused by checking the length of `self.columns` when it is `None`.
2. The failing test `test_s3_copy_with_nonetype_columns` in `test/contrib/redshift_test.py` is designed to test the behavior of the `copy` function with `columns` set to `None`.
3. The expected behavior is that when `columns` is `None`, the `colnames` variable should be set to an empty string `''`.
4. The bug results in a `TypeError` due to trying to get the length of `None`.
5. The GitHub issue related to this bug suggests a potential fix by checking `if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0` to avoid the `TypeError`.

## Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, the code needs to be modified to handle the case where `self.columns` is `None` correctly. By checking `if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0`, we can avoid the `TypeError` and proceed with setting `colnames` as an empty string when `columns` is `None`.

## Corrected Version of the Function
```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options())
    )
```

By making this modification, the corrected function should now handle the case where `self.columns` is `None` without causing a `TypeError` and pass the failing test successfully.
