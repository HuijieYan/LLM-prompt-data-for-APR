## Potential Error Location
The error occurs at line 338 in the `copy` function of the `S3CopyToTable` class. The `if len(self.columns) > 0:` condition checks the length of `self.columns`, which is set to `None` in the failing test case. This causes a `TypeError` because `NoneType` has no length.

## Cause of the Bug
The bug originates from the conditional check on `self.columns` in the `copy` function. When `columns` is `None`, the code attempts to call `len()` on a `NoneType`, leading to a `TypeError`.

## Strategy for Fixing the Bug
To fix the bug, we need to update the conditional check to ensure that `self.columns` is not `None` before attempting to get its length. We can use an `and` logical operator to combine the condition with checking if `self.columns` is truthy (not `None`).

## Correction of the Buggy Function
```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options())
    )
```

By updating the conditional check in the `copy` function to include `self.columns and`, we make sure that the code doesn't attempt to check the length of `None`. The corrected version should now handle the case where `columns` is `None` correctly.
