## Analysis
1. The buggy function `copy()` is failing due to `TypeError: object of type 'NoneType' has no len()`.
2. This error occurs when trying to retrieve the length of a `NoneType` object, which is `self.columns` in this case.
3. The failing test `test_s3_copy_with_nonetype_columns` provides the input values and the expected behavior of the function when `columns` is `None`.
4. The expected behavior is that `colnames` should be an empty string when `self.columns` is `None`.
5. The issue on GitHub highlights the problem caused by passing `None` as `columns` for Redshift COPY jobs in luigi 2.7.1.

## Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug:
- Check if `self.columns` is not `None` before trying to retrieve its length.
- If `self.columns` is not `None`, proceed with getting the column names.
- If `self.columns` is `None`, set `colnames` as an empty string.

## Corrected Version
```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns is not None:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options())
    )
```

By checking if `self.columns` is not `None` before getting its length, we prevent the `TypeError` that was occurring. This corrected version should now pass the failing test and provide the expected behavior as described in the test case.
