## Fixing the buggy function

The bug occurs in the buggy function `copy` of the `S3CopyToTable` class in the `redshift.py` file. The issue arises due to the `if len(self.columns) > 0` statement, where it directly tries to check the length of `self.columns` without considering if `self.columns` is None.

The fix involves checking if `self.columns` is not None before trying to check its length to avoid the `TypeError: object of type 'NoneType' has no len()` error.

Here's the corrected version of the `copy` function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns is not None and len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

By adding the check `if self.columns is not None and len(self.columns) > 0`, we ensure that we only check the length of `self.columns` when it is not None. This modification prevents the `TypeError` from occurring when `self.columns` is None.

This correction aligns with the expected behavior and values for the given failing test case and resolves the reported GitHub issue related to the bug.
