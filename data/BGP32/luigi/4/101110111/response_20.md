## Bug Analysis

1. The buggy function `copy` in the `S3CopyToTable` class of `luigi/contrib/redshift.py` is failing due to the condition `if len(self.columns) > 0:` where `self.columns` is `None`.
   
2. The failing test `test_s3_copy_with_nonetype_columns` from `test/contrib/redshift_test.py` is mocking the `DummyS3CopyToTableKey` object with `columns=None` and calling the `run` method. This triggers the `copy` method which expects `self.columns` to be a list but encounters `None` leading to a `TypeError`.

3. The error message indicates `TypeError: object of type 'NoneType' has no len()` which precisely points to the issue where the code tries to get the `len()` of a `NoneType` object.

4. The expected behavior is to handle cases where `self.columns` is `None` without causing the `TypeError`, which can be achieved by modifying the condition to `if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:`.

## Bug Fix Strategy

To fix the bug, we need to modify the condition checking the length of `self.columns` to first ensure that `self.columns` is not `None`. By doing so, we prevent the `TypeError` when trying to get the length of `None`.

## Corrected Version of the Buggy Function

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options())
    )
```

By making the above change in the `copy` method, we ensure that the code handles the case when `self.columns` is `None` and avoids the `TypeError`.
