## Correction

To fix the bug in the `copy` function, we need to handle the case when `self.columns` is `None`. Currently, the code tries to get the length of `self.columns` without checking if it is `None`, leading to the `TypeError`.

Here is the corrected version of the `copy` function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:  # Check if self.columns is not None
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

Explanation:
- I added a check to see if `self.columns` is not `None` before trying to get its length. This prevents the `TypeError` when `self.columns` is `None`.
- By adding the `self.columns and` condition, the check for the length of `self.columns` will only happen if `self.columns` is not `None`.

This correction should address the issue reported on GitHub and ensure that the function works correctly even when `self.columns` is `None`.
