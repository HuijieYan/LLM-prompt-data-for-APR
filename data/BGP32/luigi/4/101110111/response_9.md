## Correction:

```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: luigi/contrib/redshift.py

# The declaration of the corrected class containing the fixed function
class S3CopyToTable(rdbms.CopyToTable, _CredentialsMixin):
    # This function from the same class is called by the buggy function
    def copy_options(self):
        # Please ignore the body of this function

    # The corrected version of the buggy function
    def copy(self, cursor, f):
        """
        Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

        If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
        """
        logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
        colnames = ''
        if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:  # Fixed line
            colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
            colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

        cursor.execute("""
         COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
         CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
         {options}
         ;""".format(
            table=self.table,
            colnames=colnames,
            source=f,
            creds=self._credentials(),
            options=self.copy_options())
        )
```

### Explanation:
1. The bug occurred due to trying to get the length of `self.columns` without checking if it is None. This resulted in a `TypeError` when `self.columns` was None.
2. By adding a check `if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0`, we ensure that the `len()` function is only called when `self.columns` is not None.
3. The corrected version of the `copy()` function will now handle the case when `self.columns` is None and prevent the `TypeError` from occurring.
4. This fix aligns with the suggested solution in the GitHub issue to address the problem related to Redshift COPY job failures when columns are not provided.

The corrected function should now pass the failing test case and prevent the `TypeError` from occurring when `self.columns` is None.
