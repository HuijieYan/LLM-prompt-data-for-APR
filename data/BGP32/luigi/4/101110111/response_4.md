## Analysis
The buggy `copy` function in the `S3CopyToTable` class inside `luigi/contrib/redshift.py` is failing due to checking the length of `self.columns` without first verifying if `self.columns` is not `None`. The failing test expects the function to handle the case where `self.columns` is `None`, but the current implementation does not account for this scenario, causing a `TypeError: object of type 'NoneType' has no len()`.

## Bug Explanation
1. The failing test `test_s3_copy_with_nonetype_columns` creates a `DummyS3CopyToTableKey` task with `columns=None`.
2. This task executes the `run` method, which in turn calls the `copy` method with the mocked cursor and a file path.
3. Inside the `copy` method, the buggy line tries to check the length of `self.columns` without verifying if `self.columns` is not `None` first.
4. Since `self.columns` is `None` in this case, the call to `len(self.columns)` results in a `TypeError`.

## Suggested Fix
To address this bug, we need to modify the line that checks the length of `self.columns` to first verify if `self.columns` is not `None`. If `self.columns` is `None`, we should handle this case appropriately to prevent the `TypeError`.

## Corrected Version
Below is the corrected version of the `copy` function with the bug fixed:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns is not None and len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options())
    )
```

In the corrected version, we first check if `self.columns` is not `None` before attempting to get its length. This change ensures that the function can handle the case where `self.columns` is `None` without causing a `TypeError`. This modification aligns with the expectations of the failing test and addresses the bug reported in the GitHub issue.
