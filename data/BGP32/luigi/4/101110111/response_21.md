## Analysis
1. The buggy function `copy` in the `S3CopyToTable` class is expecting `self.columns` to be a list of columns. However, in the failing test case, `columns` is being set to `None`, which causes the `TypeError: object of type 'NoneType' has no len()`.
2. The `copy` function is trying to construct a query string for copying data from S3 to Redshift. It uses `self.columns` to determine if column names need to be included in the query.
3. The failing test case sets `columns` to `None` for the `DummyS3CopyToTableKey`. The expected behavior in this case should be to skip adding column names to the query.
4. The GitHub issue suggests a possible solution by checking if `self.columns` is not `None` and then checking its length.

## Fixing the Bug
To fix the bug, we need to update the condition in the `copy` function to handle `None` values for `self.columns`.

Here is the corrected version of the `copy` function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns is not None and len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options())
    )
```

By adding the check `if self.columns is not None and len(self.columns) > 0`, we ensure that we only construct the `colnames` string if `self.columns` is not `None`.

This corrected version should now pass the failing test case and handle the case where `self.columns` is set to `None`.
