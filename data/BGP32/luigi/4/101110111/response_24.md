## Correction

### Strategy for fixing the bug
The bug occurs due to trying to calculate the length of `self.columns` when it is `None`. To fix this bug, we need to first check if `self.columns` is not `None` before trying to calculate its length.

### Corrected Version

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.
    
    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options())
    )
```

In this corrected version, we added a check `if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:` before trying to calculate the length of `self.columns`. This will prevent the `TypeError` that was occurring when `self.columns` was `None`. Now the function will only proceed with calculating colnames if `self.columns` is not `None`.
