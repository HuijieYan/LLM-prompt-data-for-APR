## Corrected version of the buggy function

```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: luigi/contrib/redshift.py

# The declaration of the class containing the corrected function
class S3CopyToTable(rdbms.CopyToTable, _CredentialsMixin):
    # This function from the same class is called by the buggy function
    def copy_options(self):
        # Please ignore the body of this function



    # this is the corrected function
    def copy(self, cursor, f):
        """
        Defines copying from s3 into redshift.
    
        If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
        """
        logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
        colnames = ''
        if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:
            colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
            colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)
    
        cursor.execute("""
         COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
         CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
         {options}
         ;""".format(
            table=self.table,
            colnames=colnames,
            source=f,
            creds=self._credentials(),
            options=self.copy_options)
        )
    
```

By adding the condition `if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:`, we first check if `self.columns` is not None before attempting to get its length. This change ensures that we only proceed with constructing `colnames` if `self.columns` is not None, avoiding the `TypeError: object of type 'NoneType' has no len()` issue.

This correction aligns with the suggested solution in the related GitHub issue.
