## Fixing the buggy function

### Potential error locations within the buggy function
1. The line causing the error is `if len(self.columns) > 0:` when `self.columns` is `None`.
2. The `if` condition does not handle the case where `self.columns` is `None`.
3. The `colnames` variable assignment expects `self.columns` to be a list but fails when it's `None`.

### Explanation of the bug
The error occurs because the buggy function assumes `self.columns` is always a list and tries to get its length when it's `None`. This assumption leads to a `TypeError` when trying to find the length of a `NoneType` object.

### Strategy for fixing the bug
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the `if` condition checks if `self.columns` is not `None` before trying to get its length. If `self.columns` is `None`, we can set `colnames` to an empty string directly.

### Corrected version of the function
```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns is not None:  # Check if self.columns is not None
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options())
    )
```

By including a check for `self.columns` not being `None` before trying to get its length, we handle the case where `columns` is `None` and ensure the function executes without errors.
