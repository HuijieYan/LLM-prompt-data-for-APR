## Correction of the buggy function

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options())
    )
```

In the corrected version of the `copy` function:
- The `if` condition now verifies if `self.columns` is not `None` before checking its length. This prevents the `TypeError` when `self.columns` is `None`.
- The `colnames` variable is constructed based on the condition that `self.columns` is not `None`.
- `self.copy_options` is now called as a method to provide the necessary options for the `COPY` statement.

By making these changes, the function should now handle the case where `self.columns` is `None` as intended and execute successfully, passing the failing test case and meeting the expected input/output values.
