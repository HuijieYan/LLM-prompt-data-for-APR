## Fixing the bug in the provided function

### Analysis:
The bug occurs in the `copy` function of the `S3CopyToTable` class in the `redshift.py` file. The issue is caused by trying to check the length of `self.columns`, which might be None. This results in a `TypeError: object of type 'NoneType' has no len()`.

### Bug Location:
The bug is located in the line:
```python
if len(self.columns) > 0
```

### Cause of the Bug:
The bug occurs because the code is trying to get the length of `self.columns` without checking if it is None. Since `self.columns` is being set as `None` in the test case, this check can raise an error.

### Suggested Fix:
To fix the bug, we need to update the conditional check to first verify if `self.columns` is not `None` before trying to get its length.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
class S3CopyToTable(rdbms.CopyToTable, _CredentialsMixin):
    
    def copy(self, cursor, f):
        """
        Defines copying from s3 into redshift.
    
        If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
        """
        logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
        colnames = ''
        if self.columns is not None and len(self.columns) > 0:
            colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
            colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)
    
        cursor.execute("""
         COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
         CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
         {options}
         ;""".format(
            table=self.table,
            colnames=colnames,
            source=f,
            creds=self._credentials(),
            options=self.copy_options)
        )
```

With this correction, the function will first check if `self.columns` is not `None` before attempting to get its length, preventing the `TypeError` that was occurring in the buggy function.
