The bug in the `copy` function is due to checking the length of `self.columns` without verifying if `self.columns` is not None. When `self.columns` is None, the buggy code attempts to check the length of a NoneType, leading to the TypeError.

To fix this bug, we need to add a condition to check if `self.columns` is not None before checking its length.

Below is the corrected version of the `copy` function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''

    if self.columns is not None and len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

By adding the condition `if self.columns is not None and len(self.columns) > 0` before accessing the length of `self.columns`, we ensure that the bug is fixed and the function will behave correctly when `self.columns` is None.

This correction addresses the bug identified in the failing test and follows the expected input/output values.
