The bug in the provided function is that the `colnames` variable is being set to an empty string `''`, but then being formatted as `(colname1,colname2,..)` in the SQL query. This will cause an error if there are columns present in `self.columns`.

To fix this bug, we need to only add the column names in the `colnames` variable if `self.columns` is not empty.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

This corrected version will now only include column names in the SQL query if `self.columns` is not empty, fixing the bug where an empty string was being formatted as column names.
