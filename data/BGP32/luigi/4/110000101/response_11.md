### Analysis
The buggy function `copy` in the `S3CopyToTable` class is expected to copy data from S3 into Redshift. However, there is a bug in the function where the `colnames` variable is not being used correctly. The `colnames` variable is being constructed based on the `self.columns`, but it is not being passed correctly into the `COPY` query.

### Bug in the code
The bug in the code is that the `colnames` variable is constructed correctly but not being used in the `COPY` query. The `colnames` variable should be included in the `COPY` query to specify the column names.

### Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to include the `colnames` variable in the `COPY` query template string.

### Corrected Version
```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```
