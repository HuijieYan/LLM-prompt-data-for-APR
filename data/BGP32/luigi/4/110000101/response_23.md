### Analysis
The buggy function `copy` in the `S3CopyToTable` class is supposed to copy data from an S3 source into a Redshift table. The bug seems to be related to the formatting of the `COPY` command query in the `cursor.execute` statement. The `colnames` variable is not properly formatted and included in the query.

### Bug Explanation
The bug occurs because the `colnames` variable, which is supposed to contain the column names for insertion, is not being formatted correctly. The `cursor.execute` statement is not properly including the `colnames` in the `COPY` command query, which can lead to errors during the data insertion process.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to properly format the `colnames` variable and ensure it is included in the `COPY` command query within the `cursor.execute` statement. The `colnames` should be included after the table name in the `COPY` command query.

### Corrected Version
```python
# The declaration of the class containing the corrected function
class S3CopyToTable(rdbms.CopyToTable, _CredentialsMixin):
    """
    Template task for inserting a data set into Redshift from s3.
    
    Usage:
    
    * Subclass and override the required attributes:
    
      * `host`,
      * `database`,
      * `user`,
      * `password`,
      * `table`,
      * `columns`,
      * `s3_load_path`.
    
    * You can also override the attributes provided by the
      CredentialsMixin if they are not supplied by your
      configuration or environment variables.
    """
    
    # The corrected copy function
    def copy(self, cursor, f):
        """
        Defines copying from s3 into redshift.
    
        If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
        """
        logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
        colnames = ''
        if len(self.columns) > 0:
            colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
            colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)
    
        cursor.execute("""
         COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
         CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
         {options}
         ;""".format(
            table=self.table,
            colnames=colnames,  # Include colnames after the table name in the COPY command query
            source=f,
            creds=self._credentials(),
            options=self.copy_options)
        )
```

This corrected version properly formats the `colnames` variable and includes it in the `COPY` command query within the `cursor.execute` statement.
