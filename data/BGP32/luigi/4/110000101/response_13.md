### Analysis
The buggy function `copy` in the `S3CopyToTable` class is responsible for copying data from S3 into Redshift. The bug seems to be related to the formatting of the SQL query string in the `cursor.execute` method. The `colnames` variable is being formatted with parentheses even when it is empty.

### Bug Explanation
The bug occurs because the `colnames` variable is being formatted with parentheses (`'({})'`) even when it is empty. This causes the SQL query string to have unnecessary parentheses when there are no column names. This can lead to syntax errors in the SQL query when executed.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we should only include the column names in the SQL query if `self.columns` is not empty. This way, we can avoid unnecessary parentheses in the query.

### Corrected Version
```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

In the corrected version, the `colnames` variable is only added to the query if `self.columns` is not empty. This avoids unnecessary parentheses in the SQL query.
