The bug in the provided function is that the `colnames` variable is being incorrectly defined as an empty string before checking the length of `self.columns`. This results in an empty `colnames` being used in the SQL query even if `self.columns` has values.

To fix this bug, we need to move the assignment of `colnames` inside the conditional block where we check the length of `self.columns`.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)

    if len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)
    else:
        colnames = ''
    
    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

This corrected version ensures that `colnames` is correctly defined based on the length of `self.columns` before being used in the SQL query for the `COPY` operation.
