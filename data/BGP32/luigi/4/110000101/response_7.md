The bug in the provided function is that the placeholder `{options}` is not being replaced with the actual value of `self.copy_options` in the SQL query passed to `cursor.execute()`.

To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the `{options}` placeholder is correctly replaced with the value of `self.copy_options` in the SQL query.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

In this corrected version, the `{options}` placeholder in the SQL query will be correctly replaced with the value of `self.copy_options` before executing the query using `cursor.execute()`.
