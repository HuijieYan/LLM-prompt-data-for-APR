The bug in the provided function is that it is not correctly formatting the COPY query string. The `colnames` variable is being generated but not used correctly in the query.

To fix this bug, we need to make sure that if `colnames` is not empty, it should be included in the query. Additionally, we need to properly format the `credentials` part of the query using `_credentials()` method.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    credentials = self._credentials() if hasattr(self, '_credentials') else ''

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=credentials,
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

This corrected version ensures that `colnames` is correctly included in the query when not empty, and the `credentials` part is generated properly using the `_credentials()` method.
