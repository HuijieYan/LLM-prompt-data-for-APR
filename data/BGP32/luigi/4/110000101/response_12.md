### Analysis
The buggy function `copy` in the `S3CopyToTable` class is designed to copy data from S3 into Redshift. The function constructs a SQL query using attributes of the class such as `table`, `columns`, `s3_load_path`, and `_credentials()` method. The bug seems to be related to the construction of the `colnames` variable and its usage in the SQL query.

### Bug Explanation
The bug in the current implementation occurs when constructing the `colnames` variable. If the `columns` attribute is empty, the `colnames` variable remains an empty string, which is expected behavior. However, in the SQL query construction, the `colnames` variable is being included even if it's an empty string, resulting in a syntax error in the SQL query.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the `colnames` variable is only included in the SQL query if it is not an empty string. We can achieve this by checking if the `colnames` variable is not empty before including it in the SQL query.

### Corrected Version

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)  # Include colnames only if it's not empty

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

With this correction, the `colnames` variable will only be included in the SQL query if it is not empty, preventing any syntax errors in the query.
