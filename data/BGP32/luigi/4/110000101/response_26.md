### Identified bug:
The bug in the `copy` function lies in the formatting of the SQL query string. The `colnames` variable is being formatted as part of the query without considering the case when`self.columns` is empty. This results in a syntax error in the SQL query if `self.columns` is empty.

### Strategy for fixing the bug:
To fix the bug, we need to check if `self.columns` is not empty before formatting the `colnames` variable in the SQL query string. If `self.columns` is empty, we should skip including `colnames` in the query.

### Corrected version of the function:
```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)
  
    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

By making the adjustment to check if `self.columns` is not empty before formatting `colnames` variable, we ensure that the SQL query will be constructed correctly, regardless of the presence or absence of columns in the `self.columns` attribute.
