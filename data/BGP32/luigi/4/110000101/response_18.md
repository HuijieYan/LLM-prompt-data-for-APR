### Bug Explanation
The bug in the `copy` function lies in the formatting of the SQL query. The `colnames` variable is being incorporated into the query without handling the case when it is empty. This results in a SQL query syntax error when `colnames` is empty, as it leaves an extra comma in the query.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to check if `colnames` is empty before including it in the SQL query. If it is empty, we should exclude the column names section from the query.

### Corrected Version of the Function
```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    if colnames:
        colnames = f" {colnames}"
    
    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table}{colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

This corrected version of the function includes a check to only append the column names section if `colnames` is not empty. This ensures that the SQL query is constructed correctly and avoids syntax errors.
