### Analysis
The buggy function `copy` is responsible for copying data from an S3 bucket into a Redshift table. The bug seems to be related to the formatting of the SQL query within the `cursor.execute` method. The `colnames` variable is not being used correctly in the query construction, which may lead to incorrect SQL syntax.

### Bug Cause
The bug occurs because the `colnames` variable is not being properly formatted within the SQL query. The `colnames` variable should be enclosed in parentheses when constructing the column names in the `COPY` command.

### Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the `colnames` variable is correctly formatted within the SQL query by enclosing the column names in parentheses.

### Corrected Version
```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

In the corrected version, the `colnames` variable is enclosed in parentheses when constructing the column names in the `COPY` command. This should resolve the bug and ensure the correct SQL syntax for copying data from S3 to Redshift.
