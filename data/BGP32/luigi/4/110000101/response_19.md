### Bugs Identified:
1. The `logger` object is being used in the `copy` function without being imported or defined within the scope of the function.
2. The `copy_options` attribute is being used in the `cursor.execute` statement without being properly handled if it is not provided by the user.

### Cause of the Bugs:
1. The `logger` object is a standard way of logging in Python, and it seems to be expected to be used in the `copy` function to log information. However, it is not imported or defined in the function's scope, leading to a `NameError` when trying to access it.
2. The `copy_options` attribute is being used directly in the `cursor.execute` statement without any handling for cases where it might not be provided by the user. This could result in an error if `copy_options` is empty.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bugs:
1. Import the necessary `logger` module and define a `logger` object within the scope of the `copy` function to address the first bug.
2. Check if `self.copy_options` is empty and handle it gracefully by providing a default value or excluding it from the `cursor.execute` statement if necessary.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
import logging  # Define logger for logging

class S3CopyToTable(rdbms.CopyToTable, _CredentialsMixin):
    """
    Template task for inserting a data set into Redshift from s3.
    
    Usage:
    
    * Subclass and override the required attributes:
    
      * `host`,
      * `database`,
      * `user`,
      * `password`,
      * `table`,
      * `columns`,
      * `s3_load_path`.
    
    * You can also override the attributes provided by the
      CredentialsMixin if they are not supplied by your
      configuration or environment variables.
    """

    def copy(self, cursor, f):
        """
        Defines copying from s3 into redshift.
    
        If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
        """
        logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)  # Define logger object for logging
        logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
        colnames = ''
        if len(self.columns) > 0:
            colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
            colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)
        
        copy_options = self.copy_options if hasattr(self, 'copy_options') else ''  # Handle empty copy_options
        
        cursor.execute("""
         COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
         CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
         {options}
         ;""".format(
            table=self.table,
            colnames=colnames,
            source=f,
            creds=self._credentials(),
            options=copy_options)
        )
```

This corrected version of the function addresses the identified bugs by importing the `logging` module to define a `logger` object for logging within the function. It also checks for empty `copy_options` and handles it appropriately before using it in the `cursor.execute` statement.
