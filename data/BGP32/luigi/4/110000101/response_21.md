### Analysis
The buggy function `copy` in the class `S3CopyToTable` is supposed to copy data from S3 into Redshift. The bug seems to be related to the construction of the SQL query in the `cursor.execute` statement. The `colnames` variable is being constructed incorrectly, which might lead to errors in the SQL query execution.

### Cause of the Bug
The bug is caused by the construction of the `colnames` variable. The `colnames` variable is being initialized as an empty string and then concatenated with column names without checking if `self.columns` is empty. This might lead to an incorrect SQL query being constructed with an empty `colnames` string.

### Bug Fixing Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to properly handle the case when `self.columns` is empty. We need to check if `self.columns` has any elements before constructing the `colnames` string to ensure that the SQL query is constructed correctly.

### Corrected Version
```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns:  # Check if self.columns is not empty
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

By adding the check `if self.columns:` before constructing the `colnames` string, we ensure that the `colnames` string is only constructed when `self.columns` is not empty. This should fix the bug and ensure the correct construction of the SQL query.
