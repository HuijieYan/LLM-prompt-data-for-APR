### Analysis
The buggy function `copy` is responsible for copying data from an S3 source to a Redshift table. The bug seems to be related to the handling of the `columns` attribute when constructing the SQL query in the `cursor.execute` call. The `colnames` variable is being correctly generated by joining the column names, but then it is enclosed in parentheses incorrectly.

### Bug Explanation
The bug occurs because the `colnames` variable is being enclosed in parentheses when constructing the SQL query, even if the column names are empty. This leads to a syntax error in the SQL query when there are no columns to insert.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug
To fix this bug, we need to only enclose the column names in parentheses if they are not empty. We can achieve this by adding a conditional check to determine if there are any columns before enclosing in parentheses.

### Corrected Version
```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)
    
    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
``` 

In the corrected version, we check if `self.columns` has any values before enclosing `colnames` in parentheses. This ensures that the SQL query is constructed correctly even when there are no columns to insert.
