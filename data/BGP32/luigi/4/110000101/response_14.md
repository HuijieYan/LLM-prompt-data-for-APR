### Analysis
The buggy function `copy` is responsible for copying data from an S3 source into Redshift. The bug in the code seems to be related to the formatting of the `COPY` query, particularly with the `colnames` variable. The `colnames` variable should be constructed based on the columns provided, but the current implementation is not handling this correctly.

### Bug Explanation
The bug in the code is that the `colnames` variable is being incorrectly constructed before being used in the `COPY` query. If the `self.columns` attribute is empty, the `colnames` variable should remain an empty string. However, the current implementation is attempting to construct `colnames` based on the columns provided, and this can lead to errors if `self.columns` is empty.

### Bug Fix
To fix the bug, we need to check if `self.columns` is empty before constructing the `colnames` variable. If `self.columns` is not empty, we will construct `colnames` as intended, otherwise, we will keep it as an empty string.

### Corrected Version
```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

By making this change, the `colnames` variable will be constructed correctly based on the columns provided only if `self.columns` is not empty. This will prevent any errors related to an empty `self.columns`.
