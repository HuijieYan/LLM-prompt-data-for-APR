### Analysis
The `copy` function is responsible for executing a SQL `COPY` command to copy data from S3 into Redshift. The bug seems to be related to the construction of the `COPY` command string using the `cursor.execute` method.

### Potential Error Locations
1. Constructing the `colnames` variable from `self.columns`.
2. Formatting the SQL `COPY` command string.
3. Passing the wrong parameters to the `format` method.

### Cause of the Bug
The bug may be caused by incorrect formatting of the `COPY` command string, which results in an error when executing the `cursor.execute` method. The wrong parameters may be passed to the `format` method, causing an invalid SQL command to be generated.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug
1. Ensure that the `colnames` variable is constructed correctly.
2. Verify that the `COPY` command string is formatted properly with all the required parameters.
3. Double-check that the parameters passed to the `format` method match the placeholders in the command string.

### Corrected Version of the Function
```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    
    if self.columns:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS 'aws_access_key_id={aws_access_key_id};aws_secret_access_key={aws_secret_access_key}'
     {options};
     """.format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        aws_access_key_id=self.aws_access_key_id,
        aws_secret_access_key=self.aws_secret_access_key,
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

This corrected version ensures that the `COPY` command string is properly formatted with the correct placeholders and variables passed. Additionally, it checks if `self.columns` is not empty before constructing the `colnames` variable.
