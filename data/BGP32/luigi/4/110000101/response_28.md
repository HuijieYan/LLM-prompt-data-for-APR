The bug in the provided function is that the `cols` variable is not being defined properly and used in the `COPY` query. This leads to an error when trying to execute the SQL query.

To fix this bug, we need to properly define the `colnames` variable by checking if `self.columns` is not empty and then constructing the comma-separated column names. 

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

This version fixes the bug by properly defining the `colnames` variable before using it in the `COPY` query. This change ensures that the function can execute the SQL query without any errors.
