The bug in the provided code is that the `copy_options` attribute is being referenced without being initialized. This results in a `NoneType` object being used in the format string, causing an error during the `cursor.execute()` call.

To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the `copy_options` attribute is properly initialized in the `S3CopyToTable` class. We can set a default value for `copy_options` attribute in the class definition.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
# The corrected version of the buggy function
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options if hasattr(self, 'copy_options') else '')
    )
```

By including the check `if hasattr(self, 'copy_options')`, we ensure that the `copy_options` attribute is only included in the format string if it has been initialized in the class. This should prevent any errors related to the `copy_options` attribute being `None`.
