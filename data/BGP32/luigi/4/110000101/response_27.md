### Analysis
The buggy function `copy()` in the class `S3CopyToTable` is responsible for executing a SQL COPY command in Redshift from an S3 source. The function builds the SQL query dynamically based on the input parameters.

### Identified Error
The bug in the function is that the `colnames` variable is defined but not used in the SQL query construction.

### Cause of the Bug
The cause of the bug is that the `colnames` variable is computed correctly but not included in the SQL query string, so the SQL query is missing the column names part.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug
To fix the bug, we need to include the `colnames` variable in the SQL query string so that the column names are properly included in the COPY command.

### Corrected Version
```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

By including the `colnames` variable in the SQL query string, the corrected version of the `copy()` function will properly construct the COPY command with the column names included.
