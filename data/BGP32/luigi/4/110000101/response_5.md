### Analysis:
The buggy function `copy` is responsible for copying data from an S3 bucket into a Redshift table. The bug seems to be related to the generation of the `colnames`, which is used in the SQL query to specify the columns to copy. If the `columns` attribute is empty, the `colnames` variable is not being set correctly.

### Potential Error Locations:
1. Incorrect assignment of `colnames` when `self.columns` is empty.
2. The use of `colnames` in the SQL query without considering that it might be empty.

### Cause of the Bug:
The bug occurs because the `colnames` variable is not being properly handled when `self.columns` is empty. This leads to an invalid SQL query being generated.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
We need to check if `self.columns` is empty and handle it accordingly when constructing the SQL query. If `self.columns` is empty, we should not include `colnames` in the SQL query.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)
    
    query = """
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    
    cursor.execute(query)
```

### Explanation:
In the corrected version of the function, we first check if `self.columns` is not empty before constructing the `colnames` variable. If `self.columns` is empty, `colnames` will remain as an empty string. This ensures that the SQL query is generated correctly without any errors related to an empty `colnames` variable.
