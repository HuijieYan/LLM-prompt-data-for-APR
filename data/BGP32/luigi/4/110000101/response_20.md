### Analysis
The buggy function `copy` is responsible for copying data from an S3 source to a Redshift table. The bug seems to be caused by the incorrect formatting of the `COPY` query. In the current implementation, the `colnames` variable is being constructed using the columns provided, but it is not being used correctly in the `COPY` query.

The `colnames` variable should be included within the parentheses `()` of the `COPY` query after the table name. This will correctly specify the columns to be copied from the source file.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug
To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the `colnames` variable is placed correctly in the `COPY` query, right after the table name. We can do this by updating the string formatting in the `cursor.execute()` call.

### Corrected Version of the Function
```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

By including `{colnames}` in the `COPY` query template, we ensure that the columns will be correctly specified in the query when it is executed.
