### Error location:
The bug is located in the `copy` function of the `S3CopyToTable` class. The issue lies in the construction of the SQL query in the `cursor.execute` method. The `colnames` variable is not correctly formatted and included in the query, leading to a syntax error in the SQL statement.

### Cause of the bug:
The bug occurs because the `colnames` variable is added to the SQL query string even when the `self.columns` attribute is empty. This results in an extra comma in the SQL statement, causing a syntax error.

### Strategy for fixing the bug:
To fix the bug, we need to check if the `self.columns` attribute is empty before constructing the `colnames` variable. If `self.columns` is not empty, then we construct the `colnames` variable with the column names. Otherwise, we leave `colnames` as an empty string.

### Corrected version of the function:
```python
# The declaration of the class containing the corrected function
class S3CopyToTable(rdbms.CopyToTable, _CredentialsMixin):
    """
    Template task for inserting a data set into Redshift from s3.
    
    Usage:
    
    * Subclass and override the required attributes:
    
      * `host`,
      * `database`,
      * `user`,
      * `password`,
      * `table`,
      * `columns`,
      * `s3_load_path`.
    
    * You can also override the attributes provided by the
      CredentialsMixin if they are not supplied by your
      configuration or environment variables.
    """

    # the corrected copy function
    def copy(self, cursor, f):
        """
        Defines copying from s3 into redshift.
    
        If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
        """
        logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
        colnames = ''
        if self.columns:
            colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
            colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)
    
        cursor.execute("""
         COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
         CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
         {options}
         ;""".format(
            table=self.table,
            colnames=colnames,
            source=f,
            creds=self._credentials(),
            options=self.copy_options)
        )
``` 

By making this correction, the `colnames` variable will only be included in the SQL query if there are columns to be inserted, thus fixing the bug.
