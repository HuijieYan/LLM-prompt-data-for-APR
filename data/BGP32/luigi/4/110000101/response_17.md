The bug in the provided function is due to missing quotes around the table name in the SQL query generated by the `cursor.execute()` call. This can lead to SQL syntax errors if the table name contains special characters or spaces.

To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the `table` variable is properly enclosed in quotes in the SQL query string.

Here is the corrected version of the `copy()` function:

```python
# The declaration of the class containing the corrected function
class S3CopyToTable(rdbms.CopyToTable, _CredentialsMixin):
    """
    Template task for inserting a data set into Redshift from s3.
    
    Usage:
    
    * Subclass and override the required attributes:
    
      * `host`,
      * `database`,
      * `user`,
      * `password`,
      * `table`,
      * `columns`,
      * `s3_load_path`.
    
    * You can also override the attributes provided by the
      CredentialsMixin if they are not supplied by your
      configuration or environment variables.
    """

    def copy(self, cursor, f):
        """
        Defines copying from s3 into redshift.
    
        If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
        """
        logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
        colnames = ''
        if len(self.columns) > 0:
            colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
            colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)
    
        cursor.execute("""
         COPY "{table}" {colnames} from '{source}'
         CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
         {options}
         ;""".format(
            table=self.table,
            colnames=colnames,
            source=f,
            creds=self._credentials(),
            options=self.copy_options)
        )
```

By adding double quotes around the `{table}` variable in the SQL query string, we ensure that the table name is properly enclosed and prevent SQL syntax errors. This corrected version should now handle table names with special characters or spaces correctly.
