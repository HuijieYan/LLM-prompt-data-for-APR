### Analysis
The buggy function `copy` is attempting to execute a SQL `COPY` command to copy data from an S3 source into a Redshift table. The bug seems to be related to constructing the `COPY` command string, specifically with the `colnames` variable.

### Error
The bug seems to be with how `colnames` is constructed. If `self.columns` is an empty list, `colnames` remains an empty string. However, when constructing the `COPY` command, if `colnames` is empty, it should not be included.

### Bug Cause
The bug causes the SQL query to be syntactically incorrect if `self.columns` is empty because the `colnames` is included in the query string.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug
We should only include `colnames` in the `COPY` command if it is not an empty string. We can add a conditional check before constructing the `COPY` command string to address this issue.

### Corrected Version
```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    copy_query = """
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames if colnames else '',  # Only include colnames if it is not empty
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options
    )

    cursor.execute(copy_query)
```

This corrected version of the `copy` function will only include `colnames` in the `COPY` command if it is not an empty string, resolving the bug.
