## Analysis:
The buggy function `copy()` is responsible for inserting a data set into Redshift from an S3 bucket. The function constructs a COPY command to copy data from S3 into Redshift. The bug seems to be related to the construction of the `colnames` variable and its usage in the SQL query string.

## Bug Explanation:
The bug in the function occurs when constructing the `colnames` variable. If `self.columns` is empty, `colnames` remains an empty string. However, in the SQL query construction, parentheses are added around `colnames` even if it's empty, which can lead to syntax errors in the SQL query.

## Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the parentheses are only added around `colnames` when it is not empty. If `self.columns` is not empty, then construct `colnames` with parentheses. Otherwise, leave `colnames` as an empty string without parentheses.

## Corrected Version:
```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
	Specifies copying data from S3 into Redshift.
	
	When both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, 
	role-based credentials will be used.
	"""
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)
    
    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

In the corrected version, the condition `if self.columns` is used to check if `self.columns` is not empty. If it's not empty, `colnames` is constructed with parentheses. Otherwise, `colnames` remains an empty string. This fix ensures that the SQL query is constructed correctly even when `self.columns` is empty.
