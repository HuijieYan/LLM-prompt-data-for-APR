### Analysis
The buggy function `copy` in the `S3CopyToTable` class is supposed to define copying from an S3 bucket into Redshift. However, there are potential issues with how the SQL query is constructed and executed within the function. The function is using string formatting to construct the SQL query, which can lead to SQL injection vulnerabilities and incorrect query generation.

### Bugs
1. The use of string formatting in constructing the SQL query can lead to SQL injection vulnerabilities.
2. The `colnames` variable is constructed using column names from `self.columns`, but it is not handling empty columns correctly.

### Bug Cause
The bug arises from directly using string formatting to construct the SQL query in the `copy` function. This can introduce SQL injection vulnerabilities if the input values are not sanitized. Additionally, the `colnames` variable is constructed without handling cases when `self.columns` is empty.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug
To fix the bug, we should use parameterized queries instead of string formatting to construct the SQL query. This will prevent SQL injection vulnerabilities. Additionally, we should handle the case when `self.columns` is empty to avoid errors during query construction.

### Corrected Version
```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    query = """
     COPY {table} {colnames} from %s
     CREDENTIALS %s
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        options=self.copy_options)

    cursor.execute(query, (f, self._credentials()))
```

In the corrected version, we have replaced the string formatting with parameterized queries to construct the SQL query safely. We also check if `self.columns` is not empty before constructing the column names. The `f` and credentials are passed as parameters to the `cursor.execute` method to avoid SQL injection vulnerabilities.
