To fix the bug in the `copy` function of the `S3CopyToTable` class in `luigi/contrib/redshift.py`, we need to handle the case where `self.columns` is `None`. The current implementation tries to check the length of `self.columns` without considering the possibility of it being `None`, leading to the `TypeError` when trying to get the length of a `NoneType` object.

A suggested strategy to fix this bug is to first check if `self.columns` is not `None` before trying to get its length. By updating the condition for checking the length of `self.columns`, we can avoid the `TypeError` when `self.columns` is `None`.

Here is the corrected version of the `copy` function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

By incorporating the `if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:` condition, the function will now only attempt to get the length of `self.columns` if it is not `None`, thus preventing the `TypeError` that occurred when `self.columns` was `None`.

This corrected version should pass the failing test case provided, satisfy the expected input/output values, and address the GitHub issue related to the bug in the Redshift COPY functionality in Luigi.
