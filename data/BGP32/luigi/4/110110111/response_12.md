## Correction:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

Explanation:

The bug occurred because the function did not check if `self.columns` was `None` before trying to get its length, causing a `TypeError` when the length was attempted to be accessed on a `NoneType` object.

To fix this issue, the `if` condition was modified to check if `self.columns` exists and has a length greater than 0 before proceeding to create the `colnames` string.

This correction ensures that the function won't try to access the length of the `self.columns` attribute when it is `None`, preventing the `TypeError` from occurring. The corrected version should now pass the failing test and resolve the GitHub issue related to the bug.
