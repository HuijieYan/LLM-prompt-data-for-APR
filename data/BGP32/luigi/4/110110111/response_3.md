Based on the analysis, the issue arises because the `len` function is called on `self.columns` without checking if it is `None`. To fix the bug, we need to ensure that `self.columns` is not `None` before trying to get its length.

Here is the corrected version of the `copy` function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

By adding the `if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:` condition, we ensure that the `len` function is only called when `self.columns` is not `None`.

After applying this correction, the `copy` function should now handle cases where `self.columns` is `None` correctly, passing the failing test case and resolving the GitHub issue related to the bug.
