## Analysis
1. The buggy function is `copy` inside the `S3CopyToTable` class in the `luigi/contrib/redshift.py` file. The function is failing due to an issue with the `self.columns` attribute being None.
2. The bug is identified in the line `if len(self.columns) > 0:` where `self.columns` is assumed to be a list but can be None.
3. The failing test `test_s3_copy_with_nonetype_columns` creates an instance of `DummyS3CopyToTableKey` with columns set to None. When the `run` method is called on this instance, it internally calls the `copy` method causing the bug. The error message clearly points out that `object of type 'NoneType' has no len()`.
4. To fix the bug, we need to check if `self.columns` is not None before trying to get its length.
5. A corrected version of the function is provided below.

## Corrected Version
```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

By adding the check `if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:` we ensure that the code only tries to get the length of `self.columns` if it is not None. This correction addresses the issue of calling `len()` on a NoneType object and should now pass the failing test.
