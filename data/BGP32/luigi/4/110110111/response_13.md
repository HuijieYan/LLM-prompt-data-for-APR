To fix the bug in the `copy` function, we need to ensure that when `self.columns` is `None`, we don't try to calculate the length of it. 

Here's the corrected version of the `copy` function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns is not None and len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

In this corrected version, we added a check `self.columns is not None` before trying to calculate the length of `self.columns`. This ensures that we don't encounter the `TypeError: object of type 'NoneType' has no len()` error when `self.columns` is `None`.

This fix addresses the issue reported in the GitHub issue as well.

By making this adjustment, the `copy` function now handles the case where `self.columns` is `None` and avoids trying to get the length of a `NoneType` object, eliminating the bug and ensuring the function works correctly in all scenarios.
