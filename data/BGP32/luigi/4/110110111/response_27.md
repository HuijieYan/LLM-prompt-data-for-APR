To fix the bug in the `copy` function of the `S3CopyToTable` class, we need to make sure that `self.columns` is not `None` before trying to get its length in the `if` condition. The error is caused by directly checking the length of `self.columns` without verifying if it is `None` or not.

Here is the corrected version of the `copy` function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns is not None and len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

By adding the check `if self.columns is not None and len(self.columns) > 0` before accessing the length of `self.columns`, we avoid the `TypeError: object of type 'NoneType' has no len()` error. This modification ensures that the code only tries to get the length of `self.columns` if it is not `None`.

The corrected version of the `copy` function should now pass the failing test and satisfy the expected input/output values mentioned earlier. It also addresses the GitHub issue regarding the failure when columns are not provided.
