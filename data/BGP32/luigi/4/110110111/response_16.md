To fix the bug in the `copy` function of the `S3CopyToTable` class in `luigi/contrib/redshift.py`, we need to address the issue of handling `None` values in the `columns` attribute.

The current buggy code checks `if len(self.columns) > 0`. However, when `self.columns` is `None`, it raises a `TypeError` since we cannot call `len()` on a `NoneType` object.

To fix this issue, we need to modify the condition to first check if `self.columns` is not `None` before attempting to get its length.

Here is the corrected version of the `copy` function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns is not None and len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

In this corrected version, the `if` condition has been modified to explicitly check if `self.columns` is not `None` before proceeding with the `len()` check. This modification ensures that the code will not raise a `TypeError` when `self.columns` is `None`.

By making this change, the corrected version of the `copy` function should pass the failing test case described earlier and resolve the issue reported on GitHub regarding the Redshift COPY failure in luigi 2.7.1 when columns are not provided.
