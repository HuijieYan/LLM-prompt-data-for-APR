To fix the bug in the `copy` function of the `S3CopyToTable` class in `luigi/contrib/redshift.py`, we need to address the issue where `self.columns` is `None` causing a `TypeError`.

The cause of the bug is that the buggy function does not handle the case when `self.columns` is `None` properly before trying to access the length of it. This results in a `TypeError` when `len(self.columns)` is attempted on a `NoneType`.

To fix the bug, we should check if `self.columns` is not `None` before checking its length. If it is `None`, we can set `colnames` to an empty string directly.

Here is the corrected version of the `copy` function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

In this corrected version, we first check if `self.columns` is not `None` before attempting to get its length. If it is `None`, we directly set `colnames` to an empty string, avoiding the `TypeError`.

This correction should resolve the issue described in the related GitHub post and allow the `copy` function to handle cases where `self.columns` can be `None`.
