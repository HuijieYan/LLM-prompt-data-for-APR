The buggy function `copy` in the `S3CopyToTable` class is failing due to a `TypeError` caused by trying to get the length of a `NoneType` object (`self.columns`). The error occurs when `self.columns` is `None`, and the code attempts to check its length in the line `if len(self.columns) > 0`.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the condition to check if `self.columns` is not `None` before trying to get its length.

Here is the corrected version of the `copy` function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)

    colnames = ''
    if self.columns is not None and len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

By checking if `self.columns` is not `None` before trying to get its length, we prevent the `TypeError` that was occurring.

This correction aligns with the expected input/output values and fixes the issue reported on GitHub regarding Redshift COPY failures when `columns` are not provided.
