To fix the bug in the `copy` function of the `S3CopyToTable` class in `luigi/contrib/redshift.py`, we need to handle the case when `self.columns` is `None`. Currently, the bug arises from trying to get the length of `self.columns` without checking if it's `None`.

Here's a corrected version of the `copy` function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

In this corrected version, we first check if `self.columns` exists and then proceed to check its length. This change ensures that even if `self.columns` is `None`, we won't encounter the `TypeError: object of type 'NoneType' has no len()`.

By making this adjustment, the function will now pass the failing test case where `columns` is `None`.

This fix aligns with the suggested solution in the GitHub issue, providing a cleaner and safer way to handle the presence of columns in the `COPY` operation.
