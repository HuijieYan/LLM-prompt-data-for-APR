### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `copy(self, cursor, f)` in the `S3CopyToTable` class is expecting a non-null value for `self.columns` to construct the `colnames` variable. However, the test case is passing `None` for the `columns` attribute of `DummyS3CopyToTableKey`.
   
2. The error message indicates that the issue arises from trying to call `len()` on a `NoneType` object, i.e., `self.columns` is `None`.

### Bug Cause:
The bug occurs because the code directly checks the length of `self.columns` without validating if it is not `None`.

### Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that `self.columns` is not `None` before checking its length.

### Updated Code:
Here is the corrected version of the `copy` function:
```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

By adding the condition `if self.columns:` before attempting to process `self.columns`, we ensure that the code executes correctly even if `columns` is `None`. This modification will prevent the `TypeError` that was occurring due to checking the length of a `NoneType` object.
