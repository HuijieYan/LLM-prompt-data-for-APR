## Identified Bug:
The bug occurs in the `copy` function where the code checks the length of `self.columns` without first checking if `self.columns` is not `None`. The error arises due to trying to get the length of a `NoneType` object.

## Cause of the Bug:
The cause of the bug is the assumption that `self.columns` will always be a list and not `None`. The code directly checks the length of `self.columns` without considering the possibility of it being `None`.

## Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to check if `self.columns` is not `None` before trying to get its length. By adding a check to verify if `self.columns` exists and then proceeding to check its length, we can avoid the error.

## Corrected Version of the Function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:  # Check if self.columns is not None
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

By adding the `if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:` check, we ensure that we only try to get the length of `self.columns` if it's not `None`, thus avoiding the `TypeError` that was occurring.
