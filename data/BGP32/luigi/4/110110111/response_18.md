To fix the bug in the `copy` function of the `S3CopyToTable` class, we need to handle the case where `self.columns` is `None` before attempting to check its length. This will prevent the `TypeError` that occurs when trying to call `len(None)`.

Here is the corrected version of the `copy` function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

This correction checks if `self.columns` is not `None` before checking its length. If `self.columns` is `None`, it will skip the assignment of `colnames`. This change will prevent the `TypeError` and allow the function to execute successfully.

By making this modification, the `copy` function should now pass the failing test case `test_s3_copy_with_nonetype_columns` and meet the expected input/output values described.
