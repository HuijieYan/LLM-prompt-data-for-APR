To fix the bug in the `copy` function, we need to handle the case where `self.columns` is `None`. The current code checks if the length of `self.columns` is greater than 0 without explicitly checking if `self.columns` is not `None`. This leads to a `TypeError` when trying to get the length of a `NoneType` object.

Here is the updated `copy` function with a check for `self.columns` before trying to access its length:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns is not None and len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

By adding the check `if self.columns is not None and len(self.columns) > 0:`, we ensure that the code only attempts to access the length of `self.columns` if it is not `None`.

This modification should fix the `TypeError` caused by trying to get the length of a `NoneType` object and make the function work correctly with the expected input values provided in the failing test. It aligns with the suggested solution in the GitHub issue.
