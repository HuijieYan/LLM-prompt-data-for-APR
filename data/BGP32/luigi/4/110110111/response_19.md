To fix the bug in the `copy` function, we need to handle the case where `self.columns` is None correctly. Currently, the buggy function is directly checking the length of `self.columns` without verifying if `self.columns` is None or not.

We can address this issue by modifying the condition to first check if `self.columns` is not None and then proceed to check its length. If `self.columns` is None, we can set `colnames` to an empty string directly.

Here is the corrected version of the `copy` function:

```python
# The corrected version of the buggy function
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns is not None:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

This corrected version will handle the case when `self.columns` is None and set `colnames` to an empty string in that scenario.

By implementing this fix, the function will now handle the case where `self.columns` is None properly and prevent the TypeError when trying to get the length of a NoneType object. This correction addresses the bug described in the failing test and aligns with the proposed solution in the GitHub issue.
