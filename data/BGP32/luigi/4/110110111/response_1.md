To fix the bug in the `copy` function of the `S3CopyToTable` class in `luigi/contrib/redshift.py`, we need to handle the case where `self.columns` is `None` before trying to get its length.

Here is the corrected version of the `copy` function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into Redshift.
    
    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

Explanation:
- The bug occurred because the code did not check if `self.columns` was `None` before trying to get its length.
- By adding the condition `if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0`, we ensure that we only attempt to get the length of `self.columns` when it is not `None`.
- This modification resolves the `TypeError: object of type 'NoneType' has no len()` issue.
- The corrected version of the function now handles the case where `self.columns` is `None` appropriately.

By applying this fix, the function should now pass the failing test case `test_s3_copy_with_nonetype_columns` and meet the expected input/output values.
