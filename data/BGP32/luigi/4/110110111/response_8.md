The bug in the `copy` function arises from the current implementation where the length of `self.columns` is checked without verifying if `self.columns` is not `None`. This leads to a `TypeError` when trying to find the length of `None`.

To fix this bug, we should first check if `self.columns` is not `None` before proceeding to find its length.

Here's the corrected version of the `copy` function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns is not None and len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

With this correction, the function will first verify if `self.columns` is not `None` before attempting to find its length. This modification aligns with the expectation of the test case provided.

By implementing this change, the function should now pass the failing test case where columns are `None`. This modification also addresses the GitHub issue related to the bug.
