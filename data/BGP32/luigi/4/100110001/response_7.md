## Analysis:
The buggy function `copy` in `redshift.py` is causing an error due to the comparison `if len(self.columns) > 0:` where it tries to check the length of `self.columns`. The error occurs because when `columns` is `None`, you cannot find the length of a `NoneType`.

## Bug Cause:
The `DummyS3CopyToTableKey` task is being initialized with `columns=None`, and in the `copy` function, there is a check `if len(self.columns) > 0`, which causes a `TypeError` when `columns` is `None`.

## Bug Fix:
To fix this bug, we can modify the condition to check if `self.columns` is not `None` before checking its length.

## Corrected Version:
```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns is not None and len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

By adding `if self.columns is not None` before checking the length, we ensure that the code will only proceed to get the length of `self.columns` if it is not `None`, preventing the `TypeError` from occurring. This corrected version should now pass the failing test.
