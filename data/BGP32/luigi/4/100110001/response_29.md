### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `copy` is being called during the test case `test_s3_copy_with_nonetype_columns`.
2. The error occurs at line 338 in the `copy` function when trying to check the length of `self.columns` which is None.
3. The error message indicates a `TypeError`, stating that `object of type 'NoneType' has no len()`.
4. The cause of the bug is that the function does not handle the case when `self.columns` is None.
5. To fix the bug, we need to handle the case where `self.columns` is None by setting `colnames` to an empty string in that scenario.

### Solution:
Here is the corrected version of the `copy` function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns is not None and len(self.columns) > 0:  # Check if columns is not None
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

By adding a condition to check if `self.columns` is not None before trying to get its length, we ensure that the code will not raise a `TypeError` when the columns are None.

This corrected version should now handle the case where `self.columns` is None and pass the failing test.
