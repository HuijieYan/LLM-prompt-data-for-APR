### Bug Analysis:
1. The error message indicates a `TypeError` which occurs when trying to call `len()` on `self.columns`, which is of type `None`.
2. The test function `test_s3_copy_with_nonetype_columns` creates an instance of `DummyS3CopyToTableKey` with `columns=None`, leading to the `TypeError` when the `copy` function is called.
3. The `copy` function is trying to generate a comma-separated string of column names using `self.columns`, but since it is `None`, the function fails.
4. To fix the bug, we need to check if `self.columns` is not `None` before proceeding to generate the comma-separated string of column names.
5. By adding a check for `None` before processing `self.columns`, we can prevent the `TypeError` from occurring.

### Bug Fix:
```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.
    
    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    
    if self.columns is not None:  # Check if columns are not None
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)
    else:
        colnames = ''

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

By adding the `if self.columns is not None:` check, we ensure that the code will only attempt to generate the comma-separated string of column names if `self.columns` is not `None`. This prevents the `TypeError` that was occurring due to the `NoneType` not supporting `len()`.
