### Analysis:
The bug occurs in the `copy` function inside the `luigi/contrib/redshift.py` file. The function is expecting `self.columns` to be a list, but if it is `None`, then it will result in a `TypeError` because `NoneType` does not have a `len()` function.

### Bug Cause:
The `DummyS3CopyToTableKey` task is created with `columns=None`, leading to the `TypeError` when the `copy` function tries to check the length of `self.columns`.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix this bug, we need to handle the case when `self.columns` is `None` in the `copy` function. We can add a check to see if `self.columns` is `None` before trying to get its length.

### Corrected Version of the `copy` function:
```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

By adding the check `if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0`, we ensure that the code will only try to get the length of `self.columns` if it is not `None`.

This corrected version should now pass the failing test.
