### Analysis:
- The buggy function is the `copy` method in the `luigi.contrib.redshift.py` file which is responsible for copying data from S3 into Redshift.
- The failing test is `test_s3_copy_with_nonetype_columns` in the `redshift_test.py` file.

### Potential Error Locations:
- The `if len(self.columns) > 0:` line in the `copy` method is trying to check the length of `self.columns`, which is `None` in the failing test, causing a `TypeError`.

### Bug Cause:
- The bug occurs because the `columns` attribute is set to `None` when the task is initialized (`DummyS3CopyToTableKey(columns=None)`). This means that trying to check the length of `None` in the `copy` method results in a `TypeError`.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
- We need to handle the case where `self.columns` is `None` in the `copy` method. We can do this by adding a condition to check if `self.columns` is not `None` before trying to get its length.
- If `self.columns` is `None`, we can handle it appropriately to avoid the `TypeError`.

### Corrected Version of the `copy` Method:
```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    
    if self.columns is not None and len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

By checking if `self.columns` is not `None` before attempting to get its length, we ensure that the code will not throw a `TypeError` when `self.columns` is `None`. This corrected version should pass the failing test.
