### Analysis:
1. The failing test `test_s3_copy_with_nonetype_columns` is calling the `run()` method of the `DummyS3CopyToTableKey` task.
2. Inside the `run()` method, the `copy()` method is being called with a mocking cursor object and a path.
3. The error message indicates a `TypeError` related to trying to get the length of `self.columns` when it is `None`.
4. The buggy function `copy` is not handling the case where `self.columns` is `None`, leading to the `TypeError`.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is caused by the `if len(self.columns) > 0:` line within the `copy` method. When `self.columns` is `None`, an attempt to get the length of `None` results in a `TypeError` because you cannot find the length of a `None` object.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix this bug, we need to handle the case where `self.columns` is `None` gracefully to avoid the `TypeError`. One way to handle this is to check if `self.columns` is `None` before trying to get its length.

### Corrected Version:
```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: luigi/contrib/redshift.py

def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
    COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
    CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
    {options}
    ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

By adding the check `if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:`, we ensure that we only attempt to get the length of `self.columns` when it is not `None`. This change will prevent the `TypeError` from occurring when `self.columns` is `None`.
