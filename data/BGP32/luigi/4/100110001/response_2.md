### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `copy` is expecting the `columns` attribute to be a list, but in the failing test, `columns` is set to `None`.
2. The buggy function tries to get the length of `self.columns`, leading to a TypeError due to `NoneType` not having a length property.
3. This bug causes the test to fail with a TypeError when trying to access the length of `self.columns`.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix this bug, we need to handle the case where `columns` is `None` gracefully. We can check if `self.columns` is `None` before trying to access its length.

### Corrected Version of the `copy` Function:
```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

By adding an explicit check for `self.columns` before accessing its length, we ensure that the function will handle the case where `columns` is `None` without causing a TypeError. This corrected version should pass the failing test.
