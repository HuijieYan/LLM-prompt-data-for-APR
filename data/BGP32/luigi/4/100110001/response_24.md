### Analysis:
1. The failing test calls the `run()` method of the `DummyS3CopyToTableKey` task.
2. The `run()` method calls the `copy()` method from the buggy function with `None` value for columns parameter.
3. Inside the `copy()` method, the buggy function attempts to check the length of `self.columns`, which throws a `TypeError` because `NoneType` does not have a length.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is caused by the buggy function not handling the case when columns are passed as `None`.

### Bug Fix:
To fix the bug, we need to handle the case where `columns` are `None` by checking for `None` explicitly before attempting to get the length.

### Corrected Version:
```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: luigi/contrib/redshift.py

def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns is not None and len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

By explicitly checking if `self.columns` is not `None` before getting its length, we can avoid the `TypeError` that was occurring. This corrected version should now pass the failing test.
