### Analysis:
The buggy function `copy` in the `luigi/contrib/redshift.py` file is trying to concatenate column names to be used in a `COPY` statement by joining the elements in `self.columns` list. However, the bug occurs when `self.columns` is `None`, resulting in a `TypeError` when trying to get the length of `None`.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is caused by the condition `if len(self.columns) > 0:` which checks if the `self.columns` is not empty before proceeding to create the column names string. When `self.columns` is `None`, the length operation fails, leading to a `TypeError`.

### Bug Fix:
To fix the bug, we need to handle the case when `self.columns` is `None` by checking if it is `None` before trying to process it. If it is `None`, we can set the `colnames` variable to an empty string or handle it differently based on the requirement.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns is not None:  # Check if self.columns is not None before processing it
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

With this corrected version, the function will handle the case when `self.columns` is `None` gracefully and avoid the `TypeError` encountered previously.
