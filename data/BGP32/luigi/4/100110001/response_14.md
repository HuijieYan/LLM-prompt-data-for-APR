The bug in the provided code is due to comparing the length of `self.columns` without handling the case where it could be `None`. This bug is causing a `TypeError` when trying to get the length of `NoneType` object.

Here's a corrected version of the `copy` function that handles the case where `self.columns` is `None`:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns is not None:
        if len(self.columns) > 0:
            colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
            colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

With this update, the code will first check if `self.columns` is not `None` before attempting to get its length. This modification will prevent the `TypeError` that was occurring in the failing test.

After making this correction to the `copy` function, the provided failing test should pass without any issues.
