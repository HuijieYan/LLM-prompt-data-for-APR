### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `copy` in `luigi/contrib/redshift.py` is attempting to check the length of the `columns` attribute, which is being passed as `None` in the failing test.
2. The error message indicates a `TypeError` due to trying to get the length of a `NoneType`.
3. The bug is caused by assuming that `self.columns` will always have a value, leading to an error when it is `None`.
4. The bug can be fixed by checking if `self.columns` is not `None` before attempting to get its length.

### Suggestions:
To fix the bug, modify the `copy` function to include a check for `None` before checking the length of `self.columns`.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns is not None and len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
``` 

By adding the check `if self.columns is not None` before checking its length, the corrected version will handle cases where `self.columns` is `None` without raising a `TypeError`.
