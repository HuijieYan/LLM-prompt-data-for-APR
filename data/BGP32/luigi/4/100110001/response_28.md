### Analysis:
1. The buggy function is the `copy` method in the `luigi/contrib/redshift.py` file.
2. The failing test `test_s3_copy_with_nonetype_columns` is calling the `run` method of `DummyS3CopyToTableKey`.
3. The error message indicates a `TypeError` due to trying to call `len` on a `NoneType` object (`self.columns`).
4. The bug is caused by the `if len(self.columns) > 0` line in the `copy` method. Since the `columns=None` in the `DummyS3CopyToTableKey` object passed to the task, it raises the `TypeError`.
5. To fix this bug, we need to handle the case when `self.columns` is `None` before trying to get its length.

### Bug Fix:
```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns is not None:  # Check if self.columns is not None before getting its length
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

By adding the check `if self.columns is not None`, we can avoid the `TypeError` when `self.columns` is `None`. This corrected version should now pass the failing test `test_s3_copy_with_nonetype_columns`.
