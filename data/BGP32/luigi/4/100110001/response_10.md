### Analysis:
1. The provided buggy function is `copy` in the `luigi/contrib/redshift.py` file.
2. The failing test `test_s3_copy_with_nonetype_columns` is trying to test the behavior when `columns` parameter is `None`.
3. The error message indicates a `TypeError` due to trying to call `len()` on a `NoneType` object within the `copy` function.
4. The bug occurs because the function is not handling the case when `self.columns` is `None`.
5. To fix the bug, we need to add a check to handle the case when `self.columns` is `None`.

### Strategy for fixing the bug:
1. Add a check to verify if `self.columns` is not `None` before trying to get the length of it.
2. If `self.columns` is not `None`, proceed with generating the `colnames`, otherwise set it to an empty string.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    if self.columns is not None:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)
    else:
        colnames = ''

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

By adding the check `if self.columns is not None`, the bug is fixed, and the corrected version of the function should now handle the case when `columns` is `None`. This should allow the test `test_s3_copy_with_nonetype_columns` to pass successfully.
