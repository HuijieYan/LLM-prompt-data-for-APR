### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `copy` is attempting to access the length of the `columns` attribute without checking if it's `None` causing a `TypeError`.
2. The failing test `test_s3_copy_with_nonetype_columns` aims to test the behavior when `columns` is `None`.
3. The error message indicates a `TypeError` due to trying to get the length of a `NoneType`.

### Bug Cause:
The bug occurs because the `copy` function in `luigi/contrib/redshift.py` does not handle the case where `self.columns` is `None`, causing a `TypeError` when attempting to get the length of `None`.

### Bug Fix:
To fix the bug, we need to add a check to ensure that `self.columns` is not `None` before trying to access its length.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns is not None and len(self.columns) > 0:  # Check for None before getting length
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

After implementing this fix, the `copy` function in `luigi/contrib/redshift.py` should be able to handle the `None` case for `self.columns` correctly, and the failing test `test_s3_copy_with_nonetype_columns` should pass without any `TypeError`.
