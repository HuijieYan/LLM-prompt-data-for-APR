### Analysis:
The buggy function `copy` in `luigi/contrib/redshift.py` is failing due to a TypeError that occurs when trying to check the length of a `NoneType` object in `self.columns` when constructing `colnames`.

### Issue:
The issue lies in the conditional check `if len(self.columns) > 0:` where `self.columns` is `None` in this scenario, leading to a `TypeError` as `NoneType` does not have a length attribute.

### Solution:
To fix the bug, we need to handle the case where `self.columns` is `None` before attempting to get its length. One way to handle this is by checking if `self.columns` is not `None` before constructing `colnames`.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns is not None:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

By adding the condition `if self.columns is not None:`, we ensure that we only try to access the length of `self.columns` when it is not `None`, preventing the TypeError and fixing the bug.
