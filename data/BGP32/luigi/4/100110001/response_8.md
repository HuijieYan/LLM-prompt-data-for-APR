### Analysis:
1. The `copy` function in the `luigi/contrib/redshift.py` file is trying to access `self.columns` without first checking if it's `None`.
2. The failing test `test_s3_copy_with_nonetype_columns` creates a `DummyS3CopyToTableKey` task with `columns` set to `None`, which leads to the TypeError during `len(self.columns)` in the `copy` function.
3. The error message clearly states that `object of type 'NoneType' has no len()`, indicating that `self.columns` is `None` causing the error.
4. To fix the bug, we need to check if `self.columns` is not `None` before attempting to access its length.

### Proposed Fix:
The bug can be fixed by adding a null-check for `self.columns` before trying to calculate its length in the `copy` function. Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    
    if self.columns is not None:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

By adding the null-check `if self.columns is not None`, we ensure that we only try to access the length of `self.columns` when it is not `None`. This will prevent the TypeError seen in the failing test.
