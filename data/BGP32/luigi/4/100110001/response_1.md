The bug in the provided function `copy` is due to the comparison of `self.columns` with `> 0` when `self.columns` is None. This causes a `TypeError` when trying to get the length of `NoneType`.

## Bug Cause:
The `columns` attribute of the `DummyS3CopyToTableKey` task is set to `None`, which is passed to the `copy` function. The buggy function then tries to check the length of `self.columns` without first checking if it is `None`.

## Solution:
To fix this bug, we need to first check if `self.columns` is `None` before trying to get its length. If `self.columns` is not `None`, then proceed with the current logic else handle the case where `self.columns` is `None`.

## Corrected Version:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:  # Check if self.columns is not None
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

By adding the condition `if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0`, we ensure that the length of `self.columns` is only checked when it is not `None`. This modification will prevent the `TypeError` that was occurring due to trying to get the length of a `NoneType`.

This corrected version should now pass the failing test without any errors.
