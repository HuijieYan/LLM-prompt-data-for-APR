### Analysis:
1. The error occurs in the `copy` function of the `S3CopyToTable` task within the `luigi/contrib/redshift.py` file.
2. The failing test (`test_s3_copy_with_nonetype_columns`) creates an instance of the `DummyS3CopyToTableKey` task with `columns=None` and then calls the `run` method.
3. The error message shows that the bug is due to trying to call `len` on `self.columns`, which is `None`.
4. The bug is caused by not handling the case when `columns` is `None` properly, leading to a `TypeError`.
5. To fix the bug, we should check if `self.columns` is `None` before trying to retrieve its length.

### Solution:
```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns is not None and len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

This version of the `copy` function checks if `self.columns` is not `None` before trying to get its length, preventing the `TypeError` that occurred due to the original code not handling the `None` case.
