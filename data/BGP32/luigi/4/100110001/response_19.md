The buggy function `copy` is attempting to check the length of `self.columns` without first verifying if it is `None` or not. This leads to a `TypeError` since you cannot call `len()` on a `NoneType` object.

To fix this bug, we need to add a check to ensure that `self.columns` is not `None` before attempting to calculate its length.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    
    if self.columns is None:
        colnames = ''
    else:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

With this correction, the function now checks if `self.columns` is `None`. If it is `None`, then `colnames` is initialized to an empty string. Otherwise, the columns are concatenated as before. This fix should address the `TypeError` issue and make the function work correctly.
