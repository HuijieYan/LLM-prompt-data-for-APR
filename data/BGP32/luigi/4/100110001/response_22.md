### Analysis
The `copy` function in the `luigi/contrib/redshift.py` file is trying to access the `len` function on `self.columns`, which is causing a `TypeError` because `self.columns` is `None`.

### Bug Explanation
When calling the `copy` function in the failing test `test_s3_copy_with_nonetype_columns`, the `DummyS3CopyToTableKey` task is initialized with `columns=None`. 

In the `copy` function defined in the buggy `redshift.py` file, the code attempts to check the length of `self.columns` without first checking if it is `None`. This leads to a `TypeError` as `NoneType` does not have a `len` function.

### Bug Fix
To fix this bug, you can add a condition to check if `self.columns is not None` before attempting to access its length. If `self.columns` is `None`, you can set `colnames` to an empty string.

### Corrected Version
Here is the corrected version of the `copy` function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns is not None:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

With this change, the function will first check if `self.columns` is not `None` before trying to access its length. This will prevent the `TypeError` when `self.columns` is `None`.
