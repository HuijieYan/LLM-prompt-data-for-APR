### Analysis:
The buggy function `copy` in `luigi/contrib/redshift.py` is causing an error due to the comparison `len(self.columns) > 0`. The error occurs because `self.columns` is None and the code is trying to get the length of a NoneType object, which is not allowed.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is caused by the fact that the `copy` function does not handle the case when `self.columns` is None. This causes a `TypeError` when trying to check the length of `self.columns`.

### Bug Fix:
To fix the bug, we need to check if `self.columns` is None before trying to access its length.
If `self.columns` is None, we will set `colnames` to an empty string. Otherwise, we will proceed with creating `colnames` as a comma-separated string of column names.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

With this correction, the `copy` function will first check if `self.columns` is not None before attempting to access its length, avoiding the `TypeError` that was previously occurring.
