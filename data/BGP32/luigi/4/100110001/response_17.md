### Analysis:
1. The buggy function is the `copy` method in the `luigi/contrib/redshift.py` file.
2. The failing test `test_s3_copy_with_nonetype_columns` in the `contrib/redshift_test.py` file is calling `task.run()` which results in an error related to `NoneType` in the `copy` method.
3. The error message indicates that there is a `TypeError: object of type 'NoneType' has no len()`. This occurs when trying to retrieve the length of `self.columns`, which is `None`.
4. To fix this bug, we need to handle the case when `self.columns` is `None`, possibly by checking if it is `None` before trying to access its length.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Check if `self.columns` is `None`, and if so, set `colnames` to an empty string.
2. Update the `self.copy` method to handle `None` columns case gracefully.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns is not None:  # Add a check for NoneType
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

By adding the check for `None` before accessing the length of `self.columns`, the corrected version of the `copy` method will handle the `NoneType` correctly and pass the failing test successfully.
