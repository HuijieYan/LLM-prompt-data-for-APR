### Analysis:
1. The `copy` function in `luigi/contrib/redshift.py` is supposed to copy data from S3 into Redshift.
2. The failing test `test_s3_copy_with_nonetype_columns` tries to test the function when `columns` parameter is None.
3. The error occurs in the `copy` function when trying to check the length of `self.columns`, which causes a `TypeError`.
4. The `TypeError` is raised because the length of `None` cannot be determined (`object of type 'NoneType' has no len()`).

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
Since the `TypeError` is occurring when trying to get the length of `self.columns`, the solution is to check if `self.columns` is not `None` before trying to get its length. This way, we can avoid the `TypeError` and handle the case when `self.columns` is `None`.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns is not None and len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

By adding a check `if self.columns is not None` before checking the length, we ensure that the length is only calculated when `self.columns` is not `None`, avoiding the `TypeError`. This corrected version should now pass the failing test.
