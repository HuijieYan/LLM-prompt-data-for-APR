### Analysis:
The buggy function `copy(self, cursor, f)` in `luigi/contrib/redshift.py` is trying to check the length of `self.columns` which is causing an error because `self.columns` is `None`. The error occurs when the function is trying to access the length of a `NoneType` object.

### Bug Cause:
1. The function `copy(self, cursor, f)` is assuming that `self.columns` will always be a list, but in the failing test `columns` is passed as `None` to the `DummyS3CopyToTableKey` object.
2. Due to the incorrect assumption mentioned above, when the function tries to check `len(self.columns)`, it raises a `TypeError` since `NoneType` objects do not have a length.

### Bug Fix:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the function checks if `self.columns` is not `None` before trying to access its length. We can do this by adding a condition to check if `self.columns` is not `None` before using it.

### Corrected Function:
```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns is not None and len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

By adding the condition `if self.columns is not None and len(self.columns) > 0`, we ensure that `self.columns` is not `None` before trying to access its length. This correction should fix the bug and make the function behave as expected.
