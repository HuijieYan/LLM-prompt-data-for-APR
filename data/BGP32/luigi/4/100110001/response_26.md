### Analysis:
1. The buggy function is `copy` from the `luigi/contrib/redshift.py` module.
2. The failing test calls `task.run()` which in turn calls `self.copy(cursor, path)`, causing the bug to surface.
3. The error message indicates a `TypeError` due to trying to get the length of a `NoneType` object.
4. The bug is caused by trying to check the length of `self.columns` without handling the case where it is `None`.
5. To fix the bug, we need to add a check for `None` before attempting to get the length of `self.columns`.

### Updated Corrected Version:
```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:  # Check for None before getting length
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

With this fix, we are checking if `self.columns` is not `None` before trying to get its length, which prevents the `TypeError` observed in the failing test.
