### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `copy` is attempting to check the length of `self.columns`. The failing test sets `columns` to `None` which is causing a `TypeError` when `len()` is used on it.
2. The buggy function is not handling the case where `self.columns` can be `None`.
3. The failing test is trying to test the behavior of `copy` when `columns` is `None`. The error message indicates that the function is attempting to use `len()` on a `NoneType` object causing a `TypeError`.
4. To fix the bug, we need to add a check to handle the case where `self.columns` is `None`.
5. A strategy to fix the bug would be to check if `self.columns` is `None` before trying to get its length, and assign an empty list if it is `None`.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    
    if self.columns is not None:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

By adding the check `if self.columns is not None:` before using `self.columns`, the bug is fixed and the corrected function should now handle the case where `columns` is `None`.
