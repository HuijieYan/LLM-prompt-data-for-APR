### Analysis:
- The buggy function is `copy(self, cursor, f)` in the `luigi/contrib/redshift.py` file.
- The failing test is `test_s3_copy_with_nonetype_columns` in the `test/contrib/redshift_test.py` file.
- The error message indicates a `TypeError: object of type 'NoneType' has no len()`.
- The cause of the error can be traced back to the `if len(self.columns) > 0:` line in the `copy` function, where `self.columns` is None.
  
### Bug Cause:
- The bug occurs because the function is expecting `self.columns` to be a list, but in the failing test `DummyS3CopyToTableKey(columns=None)` is passed with `columns` set to `None`. This results in `self.columns` being of type `NoneType`, causing the `TypeError` when trying to check its length.
  
### Suggested Fix:
- Address the issue by checking if `self.columns` is not `None` before attempting to get its length.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns is not None and len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
``` 

By incorporating the `if self.columns is not None and len(self.columns) > 0:` check, the corrected version of the `copy` function will handle cases where `self.columns` is `None` appropriately.
