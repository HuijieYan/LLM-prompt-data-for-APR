### Analysis:
1. The `copy` function in the `luigi/contrib/redshift.py` file is trying to access the `len` function on `self.columns`, which is causing a `TypeError` when `self.columns` is `None`.
2. The test function `test_s3_copy_with_nonetype_columns` is mocking the `cursor` object and then calling `task.run()`, which in turn calls the `copy` function with `columns` set to `None`.
3. The error message indicates that the issue is with the `if len(self.columns) > 0` line, where `self.columns` is of type `NoneType` and does not support the `len` method.
4. To fix the bug, we need to check if `self.columns` is not `None` before trying to access its length.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
- Modify the `if` condition to check if `self.columns` is not `None` before adopting the length comparison.
- If `self.columns` is `None`, then set `colnames` to an empty string.

### Corrected Version of the `copy` function:
```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns is not None and len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

By making this adjustment, the corrected version of the `copy` function will handle cases where `self.columns` is `None`, preventing the `TypeError` that was encountered in the failing test.
