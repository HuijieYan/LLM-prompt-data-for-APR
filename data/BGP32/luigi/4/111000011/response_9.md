### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `copy` in the `S3CopyToTable` class is responsible for inserting data from S3 into Redshift. The bug seems to be related to the handling of the `self.columns` attribute when it is not provided.
2. The bug is likely within the section where `colnames` is being constructed based on `self.columns`.
3. The GitHub issue highlights that when `self.columns` is None, it causes a `TypeError` due to checking the length of `None`. The proposed fix suggests modifying the condition to handle this case.
4. A potential strategy for fixing the bug would be to check if `self.columns` is not None before attempting to get its length and construct `colnames`.

### Correction:
```python
    def copy(self, cursor, f):
        """
        Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

        If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
        """
        logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
        
        colnames = ''
        if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:  # Modified condition to handle None
            colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
            colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)
    
        cursor.execute("""
         COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
         CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
         {options}
         ;""".format(
            table=self.table,
            colnames=colnames,
            source=f,
            creds=self._credentials(),
            options=self.copy_options())
        )
```

### Changes Made:
1. Added a check `if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:` before constructing `colnames` to handle the case where `self.columns` is None.
2. Corrected the calling of `self.copy_options` to `self.copy_options()` in the `cursor.execute` method.

By making these changes, the bug related to Redshift COPY failures when `columns` are not provided should be resolved.
