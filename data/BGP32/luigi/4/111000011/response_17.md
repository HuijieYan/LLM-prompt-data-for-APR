To fix the bug in the `copy` function, we need to make sure that the `self.columns` attribute is not `None` before trying to access its length. The bug occurs when `self.columns` is not provided and is set to `None`, causing a `TypeError` when trying to check its length.

Here is the corrected version of the `copy` function:

```python
# The corrected version of the buggy function
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options())
    )
```

In the corrected version, we added a check to ensure that `self.columns` is not `None` before trying to access its length. This change will prevent the `TypeError` when `self.columns` is not provided. Additionally, we corrected `self.copy_options` to `self.copy_options()` to call the `copy_options` function instead of passing the function itself.

By making these adjustments, the issue mentioned in the GitHub bug report should be resolved, allowing Redshift COPY jobs to run successfully even when columns are not provided.
