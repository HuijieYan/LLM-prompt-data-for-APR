### Analysis:
- The buggy function `copy` within the `S3CopyToTable` class in `luigi/contrib/redshift.py` is responsible for copying data from S3 into Redshift.
- The issue mentioned on GitHub indicates that when `columns` are not provided, it results in a `TypeError: object of type 'NoneType' has no len()`.
- The suggested fix from the GitHub issue involves checking if `self.columns` is not `None` before accessing its length to prevent the error.

### Error locations:
1. The buggy function incorrectly assumes `self.columns` will always have a value.
2. The `len(self.columns)` is accessed without verifying if `self.columns` is `None`.
3. The `copy_options` function is called in the incorrect manner in the `cursor.execute()` statement.

### Cause of the bug:
- The bug stems from the buggy function assuming the presence of `self.columns` without verifying it. When `columns` are not provided, `self.columns = None`, leading to the `TypeError`.
- The `options=self.copy_options` should be `options=self.copy_options()`, as `copy_options` is a method, not a value.

### Strategy for fixing the bug:
- Check if `self.columns` is not `None` before accessing its length in the `copy` function.
- Call the `copy_options` method correctly by using `self.copy_options()`.

### Corrected Version:
```python
# Updated correction for the buggy function

def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:  # Check if self.columns is not None
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options())  # Correctly call the method copy_options
    )
```

By implementing the suggested fixes, the corrected version of the `copy` function will now address the bug reported in the GitHub issue related to Redshift COPY failures in Luigi.
