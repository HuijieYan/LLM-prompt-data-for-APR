### Analysis:
1. The buggy function is named `copy` inside the `S3CopyToTable` class, which is a template task for inserting a dataset into Redshift from S3.
2. The bug seems to be related to the handling of the `columns` attribute. When `self.columns` is None or not provided, the buggy function tries to extract column names from it without checking if it is None.
3. The GitHub issue indicates that providing `columns = None` to prohibit table creation leads to a TypeError when running Redshift COPY jobs in luigi 2.7.1. The issue points out the specific line causing the error and suggests a potential solution.
4. The strategy to fix the bug is to add a condition to check if `self.columns` is not None before trying to extract column names from it.

### Correction:
```python
    def copy(self, cursor, f):
        """
        Defines copying from s3 into redshift.
    
        If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
        """
        logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
        colnames = ''
        if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:  # Fixing the bug by checking if self.columns is not None before processing
            colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
            colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)
    
        cursor.execute("""
         COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
         CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
         {options}
         ;""".format(
            table=self.table,
            colnames=colnames,
            source=f,
            creds=self._credentials(),
            options=self.copy_options())
        )
```

By adding a conditional check for `self.columns`, the corrected version of the `copy` function ensures that the buggy behavior described in the GitHub issue is addressed.
