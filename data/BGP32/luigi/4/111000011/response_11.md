### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `copy` within the `S3CopyToTable` class in the `redshift.py` file of the `luigi` library is causing an issue when `self.columns` is `None`.
2. The related function `copy_options` is called within the buggy function.
3. The GitHub issue indicates that the bug occurs in luigi 2.7.1 when `columns` are not provided, resulting in a `TypeError` due to trying to get the length of a `NoneType`.
4. The bug is caused by not checking if `self.columns` is `None` before attempting to get its length.
5. The suggested fix from the GitHub issue is to check if `self.columns` is not `None` before checking its length.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Modify the `copy` function to check if `self.columns` is not `None` before attempting to get its length.
2. If `self.columns` is not `None`, then proceed with getting its length and constructing the `colnames` string.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:  # Check if self.columns is not None before getting its length
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options())
    )
```

By implementing this fix, the `copy` function will now correctly handle cases where `self.columns` is `None`, preventing the `TypeError` mentioned in the GitHub issue.
