## Analysis:
1. The buggy function `copy` is responsible for copying data from S3 into Redshift.
2. The issue reported on GitHub indicates that the bug occurs when `self.columns` is None and leads to a `TypeError` due to calling `len(None)`.
3. The bug is caused by the assumption that `self.columns` will always have a value before attempting to extract column names from it.
4. The suggested solution involves adding a check for `self.columns` before trying to get its length to avoid the `TypeError`.

## Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Check if `self.columns` is not None before extracting column names.
2. If `self.columns` is not None, then proceed to extract column names, otherwise set `colnames` to an empty string.

## Corrected Version:
```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from S3 into Redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options())
    )
```

## Changes Made:
1. Added a check `if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:` before extracting column names.
2. Corrected the call to `self.copy_options` by adding `()` to call the method properly.
