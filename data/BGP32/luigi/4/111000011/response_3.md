## Analysis:
- The buggy function `copy` in the `S3CopyToTable` class is responsible for copying data from S3 to Redshift.
- The issue reported on GitHub indicates that when the `columns` attribute is not provided, the function throws a `TypeError` due to attempting to get the length of a `NoneType`.

## Potential Error Locations:
1. The usage of `len(self.columns)` without checking if `self.columns` is not `None`.
2. The incorrect handling of the `columns` attribute when it's not provided.

## Cause of the Bug:
The bug occurs because the function does not check if `self.columns` is not `None` before trying to get its length. This leads to a `TypeError` when trying to access the length of `None`.

## Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the `self.columns` attribute exists and is not `None` before attempting to get its length. We should modify the code to explicitly check if `self.columns` is not `None` before proceeding.

## Corrected Version:
```python
    def copy(self, cursor, f):
        """
        Defines copying from s3 into redshift.
    
        If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
        """
        logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
        colnames = ''
        if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:  # Check if self.columns exists and is not None
            colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
            colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)
    
        cursor.execute("""
         COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
         CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
         {options}
         ;""".format(
            table=self.table,
            colnames=colnames,
            source=f,
            creds=self._credentials(),
            options=self.copy_options())
        )
```

In the corrected version, we explicitly check if `self.columns` exists and is not `None` before trying to get its length. This change ensures that the function does not throw a `TypeError` when `self.columns` is not provided.
