## Analysis:
1. The buggy function `copy` within the class `S3CopyToTable` is responsible for copying data from S3 into Redshift.
2. The bug seems to be related to the handling of the `self.columns` attribute, which is used to construct the `colnames` string.
3. The bug causes an error when `self.columns` is `None`, leading to a `TypeError` due to calling `len(None)`.
4. To fix the bug, we need to check if `self.columns` is not `None` before checking its length to avoid the `TypeError`.

## Strategy for fixing:
1. Change the line `if len(self.columns) > 0:` to `if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:` to handle the case when `self.columns` is `None`.
2. Update the code snippet inside the `copy` function to properly handle `self.columns` attribute.

## Corrected Version:

```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: luigi/contrib/redshift.py

# The declaration of the class containing the buggy function
class S3CopyToTable(rdbms.CopyToTable, _CredentialsMixin):
    """
    Template task for inserting a data set into Redshift from s3.
    
    Usage:
    
    * Subclass and override the required attributes:
    
      * `host`,
      * `database`,
      * `user`,
      * `password`,
      * `table`,
      * `columns`,
      * `s3_load_path`.
    
    * You can also override the attributes provided by the
      CredentialsMixin if they are not supplied by your
      configuration or environment variables.
