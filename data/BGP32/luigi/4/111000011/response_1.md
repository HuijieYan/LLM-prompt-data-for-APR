## Analysis:
1. The buggy function `copy` is part of the `S3CopyToTable` class in the `luigi.contrib.redshift` module.
2. The issue mentioned on GitHub indicates that when the `columns` attribute is not provided, it leads to a `TypeError` due to trying to get the length of `None` type.
3. The bug in the `copy` function specifically occurs when trying to extract column names while `self.columns` is `None`.
4. The suggested solution on GitHub proposes checking if `self.columns` is not `None` before attempting to get its length.

## Bug Fix Strategy:
- Modify the line where `len(self.columns) > 0` is performed to first check if `self.columns` is not `None` to avoid the `TypeError`.
- Implement the suggested modification from the GitHub issue in order to handle cases where `self.columns` is not explicitly set.

## Corrected Version:
```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:  # Fix applied here
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```
