### Analysis:
- The buggy function `copy` in the `S3CopyToTable` class is responsible for inserting data into Redshift from S3.
- The issue reported on GitHub mentions that when `columns` attribute is set to `None` to prohibit table creation, the Redshift COPY job fails in luigi 2.7.1 due to a `TypeError: object of type 'NoneType' has no len()`.
- The issue states that the cause of the bug is related to the handling of columns when they are set to `None`.

### Identified Error Location:
- The buggy function assumes that `self.columns` will always have a value and tries to access its length without checking if it's empty or `None`.

### Bug Cause:
- The bug occurs because the buggy function does not handle the scenario where `self.columns` is set to `None`.
- By directly accessing `len(self.columns)` without checking if `self.columns` is empty or `None`, it causes a `TypeError` when `self.columns` is `None`.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
- Check if `self.columns` is not `None` and not empty before accessing its length.
- Modify the condition to explicitly check for a non-`None` value in `self.columns`.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:  # Check if self.columns is not None and not empty
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options())
    )
```

In the corrected version, we added a condition to check if `self.columns` is not `None` before accessing its length. This change ensures that the function handles the case where `self.columns` is set to `None`, as reported in the GitHub issue.
