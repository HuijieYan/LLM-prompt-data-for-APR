### Analysis:
- The buggy function `copy` is part of the `S3CopyToTable` class in the `redshift.py` file of the `luigi` library.
- The issue reported on GitHub indicates that when `columns` are not provided (set to `None`), the function fails with a `TypeError`.
- The issue suggests a solution to check if `self.columns` is not `None` before trying to determine its length to avoid the error.

### Identify potential error locations:
- The error might occur in the line `if len(self.columns) > 0:` when `self.columns` is set to `None`.
- Another potential error could be in the line `options=self.copy_options` where `copy_options` function is called without parentheses.

### Cause of the bug:
- The bug occurs when `self.columns` is `None`, and the length is being checked directly without verifying if `self.columns` is not `None`.
- Additionally, the `copy_options` function is being accessed without calling it, which might not provide the correct options.

### Strategy for fixing the bug:
- Modify the line `if len(self.columns) > 0:` to check if `self.columns` is not `None` before checking its length.
- Call the `copy_options` function to correctly retrieve the options for the `COPY` command.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options())
    )
```

In the corrected version:
- The line `if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:` checks if `self.columns` is not `None` before verifying its length.
- The `copy_options` function is called with parentheses to retrieve the correct options for the `COPY` command.
