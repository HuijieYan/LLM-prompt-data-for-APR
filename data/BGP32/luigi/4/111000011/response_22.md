## Analysis:
- The buggy function `copy` within the `S3CopyToTable` class is responsible for copying data from s3 into Redshift but raises an error when `self.columns` is not provided.
- The related function `copy_options` handles other aspects of the copying process.
- The GitHub issue points out that when `columns` are not provided, the function fails due to an attempt to calculate the length of `self.columns`, which results in a `TypeError`.

## Bug cause:
- The bug occurs because the buggy function assumes `self.columns` will always be provided, leading to the error when it is not.

## Bug fixing strategy:
- To fix the bug, we need to modify the condition that checks the length of `self.columns` to ensure it is not None before attempting to get its length. This change will prevent the TypeError when `self.columns` is not provided.

## Corrected version of the function:
```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:  # Check if self.columns is not None before getting its length
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options())
    )
```

By making the above correction in the `copy` function, the bug related to Redshift COPY failing when columns are not provided should be resolved.
