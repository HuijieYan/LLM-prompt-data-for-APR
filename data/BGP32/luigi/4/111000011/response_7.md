## Analysis:
1. The buggy function `copy` within the `S3CopyToTable` class in the file `luigi/contrib/redshift.py` is responsible for inserting data into Redshift from s3.
2. The buggy function checks if `self.columns` is provided, creates a string of column names if available, and then executes a SQL `COPY` command using the provided parameters.
3. The GitHub issue highlights that when `self.columns` is `None`, it results in a `TypeError` due to trying to get the length of a `NoneType`. The proposed fix suggests checking if `self.columns` exists and then proceeding with getting its length.
4. The strategy for fixing the bug is to modify the condition that checks the length of `self.columns` to avoid the `TypeError` when `self.columns` is `None`.

## Bug Fix:
```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: luigi/contrib/redshift.py

# The declaration of the class containing the buggy function
class S3CopyToTable(rdbms.CopyToTable, _CredentialsMixin):
    """
    Template task for inserting a data set into Redshift from s3.
    
    Usage:
    
    * Subclass and override the required attributes:
    
      * `host`,
      * `database`,
      * `user`,
      * `password`,
      * `table`,
      * `columns`,
      * `s3_load_path`.
    
    * You can also override the attributes provided by the
      CredentialsMixin if they are not supplied by your
      configuration or environment variables.
