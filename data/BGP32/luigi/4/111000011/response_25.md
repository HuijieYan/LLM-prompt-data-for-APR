## Analysis:
1. The buggy function `copy` within the `S3CopyToTable` class in `luigi/contrib/redshift.py` is responsible for defining the copying process from S3 into Redshift.
2. The issue reported on GitHub mentions that running Redshift COPY jobs with `columns = None` to prevent table creation fails due to a `TypeError: object of type 'NoneType' has no len()`.
3. The cause of the bug seems to be related to the check for the length of `self.columns` without verifying if `self.columns` is not None before trying to get its length.
4. To fix the bug, we need to ensure that `self.columns` is not None before checking its length to avoid the mentioned `TypeError`.
5. To resolve the bug, we will modify the condition checking the length of `self.columns` to first verify if `self.columns` exists and is not None.

## Corrected Version:
```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

By adding the `if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0` condition before processing `self.columns`, we ensure that the code does not attempt to calculate the length of `None` and avoid the `TypeError` issue reported on GitHub.
