## Analysis:
1. The buggy function `copy` in the class `S3CopyToTable` is responsible for performing the copy operation from an S3 source to a Redshift table. It constructs a SQL query to execute the `COPY` command.
2. The bug occurs when `self.columns` is not provided, leading to an error when trying to access the length of `self.columns`.
3. The bug is related to the issue reported on GitHub, where the `self.columns` attribute being None causes the `TypeError: object of type 'NoneType' has no len()` error. The fix suggested in the GitHub issue would prevent this error by checking if `self.columns` is not None before trying to access its length.
4. A strategy to fix this bug would involve a check for `self.columns` being not None before trying to determine its length and constructing the `colnames` string for the SQL query.

## Corrected Version:
```python
    def copy(self, cursor, f):
        """
        Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

        If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
        """
        logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
        colnames = ''
        if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:
            colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
            colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

        cursor.execute("""
         COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
         CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
         {options}
         ;""".format(
            table=self.table,
            colnames=colnames,
            source=f,
            creds=self._credentials(),
            options=self.copy_options())
        )
```

In the corrected version, the bug is fixed by checking if `self.columns` is not None before trying to access its length. This prevents the `TypeError` when `self.columns` is not provided. Additionally, the `copy_options` method is correctly called with parentheses to execute it.
