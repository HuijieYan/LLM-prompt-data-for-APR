### Analysis:
The buggy function `copy` in the `S3CopyToTable` class in the `redshift.py` file from the `luigi` library is failing when the `columns` attribute is not provided. The issue reported on GitHub indicates that when `columns` is `None`, the code fails with a `TypeError`.

### Identified Bug:
The issue with the buggy function is that it does not handle the case where `self.columns` is `None` before trying to access its length in `if len(self.columns) > 0:`.

### Cause of the Bug:
The bug is caused by assuming that `self.columns` will always be a list, but when it is not provided and becomes `None`, trying to access the length of `None` results in the `TypeError`.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we should first check if `self.columns` is not `None` before trying to access its length. This way, we can avoid the `TypeError` when `columns` is not provided.

### Corrected Version:
Here is the corrected version of the `copy` function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)

    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options())
    )
```

In the corrected version, we added `self.columns and` to the `if` condition to check if `self.columns` is not `None` before trying to access its length. Additionally, we also called `self.copy_options()` to properly execute the function in the SQL query. This fix addresses the issue reported in the GitHub bug related to `columns` being `None`.
