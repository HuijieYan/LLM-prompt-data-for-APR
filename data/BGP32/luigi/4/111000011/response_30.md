## Analysis:
The buggy function `copy` in the class `S3CopyToTable` is responsible for copying data from S3 to Redshift. The issue mentioned in the GitHub problem is related to a TypeError occurring when `self.columns` is None. The bug seems to be due to directly trying to access the length of `self.columns` without checking if it is None.

## Identified Error:
The error is in the line:
```python
if len(self.columns) > 0:
```
This line assumes that `self.columns` is always a list and tries to get its length without checking if it is None.

## Cause of the Bug:
The bug occurs because when `self.columns` is set to None, trying to access its length with `len()` raises a TypeError. The bug was introduced in a recent version of the luigi library and was not handled properly in the copy function.

## Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to first check if `self.columns` is not None before trying to access its length. This will prevent the TypeError when `self.columns` is not provided.

## Corrected Version:
```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: luigi/contrib/redshift.py

class S3CopyToTable(rdbms.CopyToTable, _CredentialsMixin):
    # Existing functions and documentation here...

    def copy(self, cursor, f):
        """
        Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

        If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
        """
        logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
        colnames = ''
        if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:  # Fixed line
            colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
            colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

        cursor.execute("""
         COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
         CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
         {options}
         ;""".format(
            table=self.table,
            colnames=colnames,
            source=f,
            creds=self._credentials(),
            options=self.copy_options())
        )
```

In the corrected version, we check if `self.columns` is not None before accessing its length, preventing the TypeError. Additionally, we also corrected the call to `self.copy_options()` to ensure it is called as a function.
