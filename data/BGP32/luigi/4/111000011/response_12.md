## Analysis:
The buggy function `copy` in the `S3CopyToTable` class is responsible for copying data from S3 to Redshift. The bug seems to occur when the `self.columns` attribute is not provided, causing an error when trying to access its length. This relates to the GitHub issue titled "Redshift COPY fails in luigi 2.7.1 when columns are not provided", where the bug was identified and a possible solution was suggested.

## Potential Error Locations:
1. The condition `if len(self.columns) > 0` assumes that `self.columns` is always a list, leading to an error when it is `None`.
2. The `self.copy_options` is called as a function without `()`, potentially causing issues.

## Cause of the Bug:
The bug occurs because the buggy function does not handle the case when `self.columns` is `None`. This results in a `TypeError` when trying to access the length of `None`.

## Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to check if `self.columns` is not `None` before trying to access its length. Additionally, we should call `self.copy_options()` instead of just `self.copy_options`.

## Corrected Version:
```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from S3 into Redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns is not None and len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options())
    )
```
