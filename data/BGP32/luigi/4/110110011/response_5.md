### Analysis:
- The buggy function `copy()` in the `S3CopyToTable` class is failing when `self.columns` is `None`.
- The failing test `test_s3_copy_with_nonetype_columns` is trying to test the behavior when `columns` is `None`.
- The error message indicates a `TypeError` due to trying to get the length of a `NoneType`.
- The GitHub issue "Redshift COPY fails in luigi 2.7.1 when columns are not provided" mentions the root cause and provides a potential solution by checking if `self.columns` is not `None` before checking the length.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is caused by directly checking the length of `self.columns` without validating if it's `None` or not. Therefore, when `self.columns` is `None`, a `TypeError` occurs.

### Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we should first check if `self.columns` is not `None` before proceeding to check its length. This will prevent the `TypeError` when `columns` is `None`.

### Corrected Version:
Here is the corrected version of the `copy()` function to address the bug:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns is not None and len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

By including the check `self.columns is not None` before checking the length, we ensure that the bug is fixed and the function can handle `None` values correctly.
