### Analysis:
- The `copy` function inside the `S3CopyToTable` class in `luigi/contrib/redshift.py` is trying to check the length of `self.columns` without verifying if it is `None` or not. This causes a `TypeError` when `self.columns` is `None`.
- The failing test `test_s3_copy_with_nonetype_columns` is mocking a scenario where `self.columns` is `None` and expects the `copy` function to handle this scenario correctly.
- The error message shows a `TypeError: object of type 'NoneType' has no len()` precisely at the line where `self.columns` length is checked.

### Bug Cause:
- The bug is caused because the `copy` function is directly trying to access the length of `self.columns` without checking if it is `None`.
- Since the buggy logic does not handle the case when `self.columns` is `None`, the code fails when encountering this scenario in the test.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
- Modify the condition `if len(self.columns) > 0:` to `if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:` to ensure that `self.columns` is not `None` before checking its length.
- This adjustment will prevent the `TypeError` when `self.columns` is `None`.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:  # Check if self.columns is not None before getting its length
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
``` 

This corrected version of the `copy` function should handle the scenario where `self.columns` is `None` without causing a `TypeError` and should resolve the issue stated on GitHub.
