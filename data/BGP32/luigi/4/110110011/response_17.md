### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `copy` in the `S3CopyToTable` class of the `luigi.contrib.redshift` module is attempting to check the length of `self.columns` without handling the case where `self.columns` is `None`.
2. The failing test `test_s3_copy_with_nonetype_columns` is trying to run a task `DummyS3CopyToTableKey` with `columns=None`, which leads to the error due to the buggy function.
3. The error message indicates a `TypeError` because it is trying to find the length of `NoneType`.
4. The GitHub issue highlights the specific problem in the code related to the handling of `self.columns` when it is `None` and suggests a potential solution.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is caused by the `copy` function not handling the case where `self.columns` is `None`. When the length of `self.columns` is checked without verifying if it is `None`, it results in a `TypeError` when trying to access the length of a `NoneType` object.

### Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to modify the condition where the length of `self.columns` is checked to include a check if `self.columns` is not `None` before proceeding to check its length.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

By adding the check `if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:` we ensure that we only try to access the length of `self.columns` if it is not `None`. This modification addresses the bug and allows the function to handle the case when `self.columns` is `None`.
