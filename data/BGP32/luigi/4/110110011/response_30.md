### Analysis:
1. Buggy Function: The `copy` function within the `S3CopyToTable` class is causing an error due to checking the length of `self.columns`, which is None.
2. Error Location: The error is occurring at line 338 where the length of `self.columns` is checked.
3. Bug Cause: The bug is caused because the `copy` function is assuming `self.columns` will always be a list and trying to check its length without handling the case where it might be None.
4. Fix Strategy: Modify the condition to check if `self.columns` is not None before checking its length.
5. Corrected Version provided below.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

The corrected version above includes a check to ensure `self.columns` is not None before trying to access its length. This modification addresses the bug by handling the case where `self.columns` is None, preventing the TypeError reported in the failing test.
