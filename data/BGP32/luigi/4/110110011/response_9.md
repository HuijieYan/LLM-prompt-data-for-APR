### Analysis:
- The buggy function `copy` within the `S3CopyToTable` class in `luigi/contrib/redshift.py` is causing an error when `self.columns` is `None`.
- The failing test `test_s3_copy_with_nonetype_columns` in `test/contrib/redshift_test.py` is trying to run the task with `columns=None`, triggering the error.
- The error message indicates a `TypeError: object of type 'NoneType' has no len()`.
- The GitHub issue suggests that the bug was introduced in luigi version 2.7.1 and mentions a specific pull request related to the issue.
- The suggested solution in the GitHub issue proposes changing the condition `if len(self.columns) > 0` to `if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0`.

### Bug Cause:
The cause of the bug is that the function `copy` is directly trying to access the length of `self.columns` without checking if it's `None` or not. When `self.columns` is `None`, it raises a `TypeError` because `NoneType` has no length.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we should modify the condition `if len(self.columns) > 0` to `if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0` to handle the case where `self.columns` is `None`. This change ensures that `self.columns` is not `None` before checking its length.

### Corrected Version:
```python
class S3CopyToTable(rdbms.CopyToTable, _CredentialsMixin):
    # Other code remains unchanged
    
    def copy(self, cursor, f):
        """
        Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

        If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
        """
        logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
        colnames = ''
        if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:
            colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
            colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

        cursor.execute("""
         COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
         CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
         {options}
         ;""".format(
            table=self.table,
            colnames=colnames,
            source=f,
            creds=self._credentials(),
            options=self.copy_options)
        )
```

By making this change, the corrected version of the function should now properly handle the case where `self.columns` is `None` and prevent the `TypeError` from occurring.
