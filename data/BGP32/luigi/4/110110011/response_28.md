### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `copy` in the `S3CopyToTable` class from the `redshift.py` file has a bug where it tries to get the length of `self.columns` without checking if it's `None`.
2. The failing test `test_s3_copy_with_nonetype_columns` from `redshift_test.py` creates an instance of `DummyS3CopyToTableKey` with `columns=None` and then calls `run()` on the task, which in turn calls the `copy` function with `cursor` and `path`.
3. The error message indicates a `TypeError` due to trying to access the length of `NoneType` object.
4. Based on the provided GitHub issue, the bug occurs when `columns` is set to `None` and the fix is suggested to check if `self.columns` is truthy before checking its length to avoid the error.

### Bug Cause:
The bug occurs because the code checks the length of `self.columns` directly without checking if it's `None`. This causes a `TypeError` when `self.columns` is `None`.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to modify the `copy` function to properly handle the case when `self.columns` is `None`. By checking if `self.columns` is truthy before trying to access its length, we can prevent the `TypeError`.

### Corrected Version of the `copy` function:
```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

After making this correction, the `copy` function should now properly handle the case when `self.columns` is `None` and pass the failing test without raising a `TypeError`.
