### Analysis:
- **Buggy Function**: The `copy` function within the `S3CopyToTable` class in `luigi/contrib/redshift.py` is the buggy function.
- **Buggy Class**: The `S3CopyToTable` class contains the buggy function.
- **Test Code**: The failing test code resides in `test/contrib/redshift_test.py`.
- **Error Message**: The error message indicates a `TypeError` due to calling `len()` on a `NoneType`.
- **GitHub Issue**: The GitHub issue states that the Redshift COPY operation fails when columns are provided as `None`, and it suggests a potential solution.

### Error Location:
- The error occurs in the `copy` function when trying to get the length of `self.columns` without checking if it is `None`.

### Cause of the Bug:
- The bug is caused by directly checking the length of `self.columns` without first verifying if it is `None`. When `columns` are provided as `None`, accessing `len()` on `NoneType` results in a `TypeError`.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
- The bug can be fixed by first checking if `self.columns` is not `None` before attempting to get its length.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:  # Check if self.columns is not None before getting length
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

By updating the `copy` function as shown above, the bug related to accessing the length of `NoneType` when `self.columns` is `None` will be fixed. The corrected version should now pass the failing test and resolve the GitHub issue.
