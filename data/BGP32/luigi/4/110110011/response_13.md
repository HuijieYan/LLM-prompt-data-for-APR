### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `copy()` within the `S3CopyToTable` class in the `luigi/contrib/redshift.py` file is trying to check the length of `self.columns` without verifying if `self.columns` is not `None` first.
2. The failing test `test_s3_copy_with_nonetype_columns()` in `test/contrib/redshift_test.py` is testing the behavior when `columns=None` is passed to the task, resulting in the TypeError due to `self.columns` being `None`.
3. The error message clearly indicates that the bug occurs when `len(self.columns)` is called.
4. The GitHub issue mentions the same problem when columns are set to `None` and suggests a solution to modify the condition check for `self.columns`.
5. To fix the bug, we need to modify the condition to check if `self.columns` is not `None` before attempting to get its length.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is caused by trying to get the length of `self.columns` without first verifying if it is `None`.

### Bug Fix:
To fix the bug, we will update the condition to check if `self.columns` is not `None` before checking its length.

### Corrected Version:
Here is the corrected version of the `copy()` function in the `S3CopyToTable` class:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

By updating the condition to `if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0`, we ensure that `self.columns` is not `None` before proceeding to get its length, fixing the TypeError issue when `columns=None` is passed to the task.
