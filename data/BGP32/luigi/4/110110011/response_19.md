### Analysis:
1. The buggy function is `copy` within the `S3CopyToTable` class from `luigi/contrib/redshift.py`.
2. The error occurs when the function checks the length of `self.columns`, which is `None` in the failing test case.
3. The failing test `test_s3_copy_with_nonetype_columns` creates a `DummyS3CopyToTableKey` task instance with `columns=None` and calls `task.run()`, triggering the `copy` function. The error message indicates a `TypeError` due to trying to get the length of `None`.
4. The GitHub issue highlights that the root cause is a specific line within the `copy` function and suggests a potential fix by checking for `self.columns` before trying to get its length.
5. The bug can be fixed by modifying the condition checking for the length of `self.columns`.

### Bug Fix:
```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:  # Fixing the bug by checking if self.columns is not None
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

By adding a check for `self.columns` before trying to get its length, the bug should be fixed, and the corrected function should now pass the failing test case and resolve the reported issue on GitHub.
