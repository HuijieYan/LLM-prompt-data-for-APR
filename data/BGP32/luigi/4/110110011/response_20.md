### Analysis:
The buggy function `copy` within the `S3CopyToTable` class in the `luigi/contrib/redshift.py` file is causing an error when `self.columns` is `None` due to the incorrect check for the length of `self.columns`. This error is reproduced in the failing test `test_s3_copy_with_nonetype_columns` in the `redshift_test.py` file, leading to a `TypeError`.

The GitHub issue related to this bug highlights that the bug was introduced in Luigi version 2.7.1 due to changes made in a specific pull request. The suggested fix is to change the line where the length of `self.columns` is checked to accommodate the case where `self.columns` might be `None`.

### Bug Cause:
The bug occurs because the buggy function does not handle the case where `self.columns` is `None`, resulting in a `TypeError` when attempting to check the length of a `NoneType` object.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to update the condition checking the length of `self.columns` to handle the case where `self.columns` might be `None`. We can change the condition to first check if `self.columns` is not `None` before proceeding with checking its length.

### Corrected Version:
Here is the corrected version of the `copy` function within the `S3CopyToTable` class:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:  # Updated condition to handle NoneType
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

By updating the condition to check if `self.columns` is not `None` before checking its length, we ensure that the function can handle cases where `self.columns` is `None`. This correction should resolve the `TypeError` and make the function work as intended.
