### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `copy` within the `S3CopyToTable` class in `luigi/contrib/redshift.py` is causing an error due to `self.columns` being `None` and trying to check its length.
2. The failing test `test_s3_copy_with_nonetype_columns` in `test/contrib/redshift_test.py` is trying to run the task with `columns=None`, which triggers the bug.
3. The error message indicates a `TypeError` because `NoneType` does not have a length, resulting in a failure at line 338 of `luigi/contrib/redshift.py`.
4. To fix the bug, we can modify the condition checking if `self.columns` is not `None` before proceeding with the length check.
5. The corrected version of the function is provided below.

### Bug Fix:
```python
    def copy(self, cursor, f):
        """
        Defines copying from s3 into redshift.
    
        If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
        """
        logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
        
        colnames = ''
        if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:  # Check if self.columns is not None before checking its length
            colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
            colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)
    
        cursor.execute("""
         COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
         CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
         {options}
         ;""".format(
            table=self.table,
            colnames=colnames,
            source=f,
            creds=self._credentials(),
            options=self.copy_options)
        )
```

By making this change in the `copy` function, the bug where `NoneType` columns caused an error in the `S3CopyToTable` class will be fixed. This corrected version should now pass the failing test and resolve the GitHub issue related to the bug.
