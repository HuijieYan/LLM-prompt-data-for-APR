### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `copy` in the `S3CopyToTable` class of `luigi/contrib/redshift.py` is failing due to a `TypeError` when `self.columns` is `None`.
2. The failing test is trying to run the `S3CopyToTableKey` task with `columns=None`, triggering the `copy` function.
3. The error message indicates that the bug is occurring at line 338 in `luigi/contrib/redshift.py` where it checks `if len(self.columns) > 0`.
4. The GitHub issue identifies the root cause as related to a specific change in the code.
5. The proposed solution in the GitHub issue suggests changing the condition to `if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0` as a possible fix.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is caused by the assumption that `self.columns` will always be a list, leading to a `TypeError` when `self.columns` is `None`.

### Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we should update the condition to check for both the existence of `self.columns` (`if self.columns`) and the length of `self.columns` when it is not `None` (`len(self.columns) > 0`).

### Corrected Version:
```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

By updating the condition as shown above, the corrected version of the function should now handle the case where `self.columns` is `None`, preventing the `TypeError` and addressing the bug.
