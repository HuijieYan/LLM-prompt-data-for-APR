### Analysis:
1. The buggy function is `copy` inside the `S3CopyToTable` class in the `luigi/contrib/redshift.py` file. The function is attempting to check the length of `self.columns`, which can be `None` causing a `TypeError`.
2. The error occurs in the `if len(self.columns) > 0:` line of the `copy` function.
3. The cause of the bug is that when `columns` is `None`, calling `len(None)` raises a `TypeError`. This bug was reported in a GitHub issue where it was suggested to modify the check to `if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:`.
4. To fix the bug, we need to modify the conditional statement to correctly handle the case where `columns` is `None`.
5. Below is the corrected version of the `copy` function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

With this fix, the function will now correctly handle the case where `columns` is `None`, preventing the `TypeError` that was occurring.
