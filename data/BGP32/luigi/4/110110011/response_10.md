### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `copy(self, cursor, f)` is part of the `S3CopyToTable` class in the `luigi/contrib/redshift.py` file.
2. The failing test `test_s3_copy_with_nonetype_columns` in `test/contrib/redshift_test.py` is designed to test the behavior when `columns` is set to `None`.
3. The error message indicates a `TypeError` caused by trying to get the length of a `NoneType` object.
4. The GitHub issue points out that the bug was introduced in luigi version 2.7.1 and suggests a potential solution.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is caused by not checking if `self.columns` is `None` before trying to get its length. When the `columns` parameter is set to `None`, it results in a `TypeError` because `NoneType` does not have a length attribute.

### Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we should first check if `self.columns` is not `None` before attempting to get its length. This will prevent the `TypeError` when `columns` is set to `None`.

### Corrected Version:
Here is the corrected version of the `copy(self, cursor, f)` function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:  # Fix: Check if self.columns is not None
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

This corrected version includes a check `if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:` to ensure that the length of `self.columns` is only checked when it is not `None`. This fix should resolve the `TypeError` when `columns` is set to `None`.
