### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `copy` within the `S3CopyToTable` class in `luigi/contrib/redshift.py` is failing when `self.columns` is `None` which leads to a `TypeError`.
2. The failing test `test_s3_copy_with_nonetype_columns` in `test/contrib/redshift_test.py` checks if `columns` is `None`, then the function is expected to run without any errors.
3. The error message highlights the exact issue - `TypeError: object of type 'NoneType' has no len()`, indicating the problem at line 338 of `luigi/contrib/redshift.py` where the `if len(self.columns) > 0` check is causing the error. The GitHub issue also suggests a potential solution by changing the condition to `if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:` which ensures that `self.columns` is not `None` before checking its length.
4. To fix this bug, we need to update the condition to check if `self.columns` exists and then proceed to check its length.

### Bug Fix:
```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    
    colnames = ''
    
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

By updating the condition to `if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:`, we ensure that `self.columns` is not `None` before trying to access its length. This resolved the `TypeError` that occurred when `columns` was `None` and the bug is fixed.
