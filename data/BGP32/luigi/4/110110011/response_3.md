### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `copy` within the `S3CopyToTable` class from the `luigi.contrib.redshift.py` file is expecting the `self.columns` attribute to be a list but is failing when it is `None`.
2. The failing test `test_s3_copy_with_nonetype_columns` is trying to run the `DummyS3CopyToTableKey` task with `columns=None`, leading to the TypeError when `copy` function is called.
3. The error message highlights the issue, stating that 'NoneType' has no len(). The GitHub issue linked to this problem suggests that the bug was introduced in a specific pull request.
4. To fix the bug, we need to handle the case where `self.columns` is None in the `copy` function. We can check if `self.columns` is not None before trying to get its length.
5. The suggested fix from the GitHub issue involves changing the `if len(self.columns) > 0:` line to `if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:` to handle the None case.

### Bug Fix:
Here is the corrected version of the `copy` function within the `S3CopyToTable` class:

```python
    def copy(self, cursor, f):
        """
        Defines copying from s3 into redshift.
    
        If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
        """
        logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
        colnames = ''
        if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0: # Check if self.columns is not None
            colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
            colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)
    
        cursor.execute("""
         COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
         CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
         {options}
         ;""".format(
            table=self.table,
            colnames=colnames,
            source=f,
            creds=self._credentials(),
            options=self.copy_options)
        )
```

By making this simple modification, the bug should be fixed, and the test `test_s3_copy_with_nonetype_columns` should pass successfully without throwing a TypeError.
