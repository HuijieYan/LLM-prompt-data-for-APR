### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `copy` within the `S3CopyToTable` class in `luigi/contrib/redshift.py` is failing due to a `TypeError` that occurs when trying to access the length of `self.columns`, which is `None`.
2. The failing test `test_s3_copy_with_nonetype_columns` in `test/contrib/redshift_test.py` checks if the empty column value is handled correctly.
3. The error message indicates that the `TypeError` occurs at line 338 in `luigi/contrib/redshift.py` when trying to check the length of `self.columns`. The GitHub issue points out the root cause.
4. To fix the bug, we need to modify the conditional check for `self.columns` to handle cases where it is `None`.
The suggested fix from the GitHub issue involves changing the conditional to `if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0`.

### Bug Cause:
The bug occurs because the `len(self.columns) > 0` check is trying to access the length of `self.columns` directly without considering the possibility of `self.columns` being `None`. This results in a `TypeError` when trying to get the length of `None`.

### Bug Fix:
Modify the conditional check for `self.columns` to avoid the `TypeError` by considering the case where `self.columns` is `None`.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
``` 

By adding `self.columns and` to the conditional check, we ensure that the length is only checked if `self.columns` is not `None`. This modification prevents the `TypeError` and resolves the bug.
