### Analysis:
1. **Buggy Function Relationship**:
    - The buggy function `copy` is part of the class `S3CopyToTable` which inherits from `rdbms.CopyToTable` and `_CredentialsMixin`.
    - The failing test `test_s3_copy_with_nonetype_columns` belongs to the test file `redshift_test.py`.

2. **Potential Error Locations**:
    - The error is likely due to checking the length of `self.columns`, which is set to `None` in the failing test.

3. **Cause of the Bug**:
    - The `copy` function checks the length of `self.columns`, but when `columns` is set to `None`, it raises a `TypeError` because `None` has no length.
    - The failing test `test_s3_copy_with_nonetype_columns` explicitly sets `columns=None`, triggering the bug.
    - The error message indicates the TypeError due to trying to get the length of a `NoneType` object.

4. **Suggested Fix Strategy**:
    - Modify the condition where the length of `self.columns` is checked to handle the case where `self.columns` is `None` to avoid the TypeError.
    - Update the condition to first check if `self.columns` is not `None`, and then proceed to check its length.

### Corrected Version:

```python
class S3CopyToTable(rdbms.CopyToTable, _CredentialsMixin):

    def copy(self, cursor, f):
        """
        Defines copying from s3 into redshift.
    
        If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
        """
        logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
        colnames = ''
        if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:  # Check if columns is not None before checking length
            colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
            colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)
    
        cursor.execute("""
         COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
         CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
         {options}
         ;""".format(
            table=self.table,
            colnames=colnames,
            source=f,
            creds=self._credentials(),
            options=self.copy_options)
        )
```

By incorporating the suggested fix strategy, the corrected version of the `copy` function checks if `self.columns` is not `None` before attempting to get its length. This modification allows the function to handle cases where `columns` is `None` without triggering a `TypeError`.
