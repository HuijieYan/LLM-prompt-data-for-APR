### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `copy` in the `S3CopyToTable` class in `luigi/contrib/redshift.py` is causing a `TypeError` when the `self.columns` attribute is `None`.
2. The failing test `test_s3_copy_with_nonetype_columns` is trying to run the `DummyS3CopyToTableKey` task with `columns` set to `None`.
3. The bug is causing the test to fail with the error message `TypeError: object of type 'NoneType' has no len()`.
4. The bug was reported in a GitHub issue titled "Redshift COPY fails in luigi 2.7.1 when columns are not provided". The solution proposed in the issue is to check `if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0` instead of `if len(self.columns) > 0`.

### Bug Cause:
The buggy function does not handle the case where `self.columns` is `None`. When `self.columns` is `None`, the function tries to perform `len(self.columns)`, resulting in a `TypeError`.

### Bug Fix:
To fix the bug, we need to check if `self.columns` is not `None` before trying to get its length. If `self.columns` is `None`, then there is no need to construct the `colnames` string.

### Corrected Version of the `copy` function:
```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    if self.columns:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)
    else:
        colnames = ''
    
    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

By adding the check `if self.columns:` before constructing the `colnames` string, we ensure that the function does not attempt to use `len()` on a `None` object, fixing the `TypeError` issue.
