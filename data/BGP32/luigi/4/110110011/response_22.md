### Analysis:
1. **Buggy function:** The `copy` function within the `S3CopyToTable` class in `luigi/contrib/redshift.py` is throwing a `TypeError` when `self.columns` is `None`.
2. **Relation:** The `copy` function is called within the `run` method of a test class `DummyS3CopyToTableKey` in `test/contrib/redshift_test.py`.
3. **Error:** The error occurs due to an attempt to call `len()` on a `NoneType` object.
4. **GitHub Issue:** The GitHub issue highlights the specific problem and suggests a potential solution involving checking `if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0`.
5. **Cause:** The error is caused because when `self.columns` is `None`, the `if len(self.columns) > 0` check fails as `None` does not have a `len()` method.
6. **Strategy:** Modify the `if` condition to explicitly check if `self.columns` is not `None` before checking its length.

### Bug Fix:
Here is the corrected version of the `copy` function within the `S3CopyToTable` class:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns is not None and len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

By adding the `if self.columns is not None` check before checking the length, we ensure that the code only attempts to calculate the length of `self.columns` when it is not `None`, preventing the `TypeError` issue.
