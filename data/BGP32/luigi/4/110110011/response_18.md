### Analysis:
1. The provided buggy function `copy` within the `S3CopyToTable` class in `luigi/contrib/redshift.py` is failing due to an error caused by `self.columns` being `None`.
2. The failing test `test_s3_copy_with_nonetype_columns` is testing the scenario where `columns=None` is passed to the `S3CopyToTable` task, triggering the bug in the `copy` function.
3. The failing test captures the error message indicating a `TypeError` due to `object of type 'NoneType' has no len()`.
4. The GitHub issue details a similar problem where passing `columns=None` results in a failure.
5. The bug occurs because the code directly tries to access `len(self.columns)` without checking if `self.columns` is `None`.
6. A potential fix would involve adding a guard clause to check if `self.columns` is not `None` before calculating its length.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, modify the condition for checking the length of `self.columns` by ensuring that it is not `None` before further processing.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    
    if self.columns is not None and len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

By adding the check `if self.columns is not None and len(self.columns) > 0:`, the corrected version ensures that the code does not attempt to calculate the length of `None`, resolving the `TypeError` issue encountered in the buggy function.
