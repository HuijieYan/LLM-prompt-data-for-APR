### Analysis:
1. The buggy function is `copy` within the `S3CopyToTable` class in the `luigi/contrib/redshift.py` file. The function is designed to perform a COPY operation from S3 to Redshift.
2. The failing test `test_s3_copy_with_nonetype_columns` in `test/contrib/redshift_test.py` is trying to test the case when `columns` are set to `None`.
3. The error message indicates that the bug is a `TypeError` due to trying to get the length of `None`.
4. The GitHub issue titled "Redshift COPY fails in luigi 2.7.1 when columns are not provided" suggests a solution to check if `self.columns` exists before checking its length in the `copy` function.
   
### Bug Cause:
The bug occurs because the code does not check if `self.columns` is None before trying to get its length. When `columns` are explicitly set to `None`, the `if len(self.columns) > 0` condition throws a `TypeError` because `NoneType` does not have a length.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to make sure to check if `self.columns` exists and is not `None` before trying to get its length in the `copy` function.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:  # Check if self.columns exists and is not None
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

By adding the condition `if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0`, we ensure that we only try to get the length of `self.columns` if it is not `None`. This fix addresses the bug reported in the failing test and the GitHub issue.
