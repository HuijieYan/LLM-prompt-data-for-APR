### Analysis:
- The buggy function `copy` in the `S3CopyToTable` class is failing due to an attempt to call `len` on `self.columns` which is `None`.
- The failing test `test_s3_copy_with_nonetype_columns` is mocking a scenario where `columns` attribute is set to `None`, triggering the bug in the `copy` function.
- The error message indicates a `TypeError` caused by trying to call `len` on a `NoneType` object.
- The provided GitHub issue identifies the same bug and suggests changing the conditional statement from `if len(self.columns) > 0:` to `if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:` to handle the case where `columns` is `None`.

### Fix Strategy:
- Adjust the conditional statement in the `copy` function to first check if `self.columns` is not `None` before trying to get its length.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

By making this change, the `copy` function will now properly handle the scenario where `columns` attribute is `None`, fixing the bug and allowing the test `test_s3_copy_with_nonetype_columns` to pass successfully.
