### Analysis:
- The buggy function `copy` within the `S3CopyToTable` class in `luigi/contrib/redshift.py` is causing an error when `self.columns` is set to `None`.
- The failing test `test_s3_copy_with_nonetype_columns` is trying to validate the behavior of the `S3CopyToTable` class when `columns` are set to `None`.
- The error message indicates a `TypeError: object of type 'NoneType' has no len()` because the code is trying to get the length of `None`.
- The GitHub issue describes this problem where the `S3CopyToTable.copy` function fails when `columns` are set to `None`.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is caused by directly checking `if len(self.columns) > 0`, which throws an error when `self.columns` is `None` since `None` does not have a length.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to modify the check for `self.columns` to handle the case when it is `None` before trying to get its length.

### Corrected Version:
```python
    def copy(self, cursor, f):
        """
        Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

        If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
        """
        logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
        colnames = ''

        if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0: # Fixed bug here
            colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
            colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

        cursor.execute("""
         COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
         CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
         {options}
         ;""".format(
            table=self.table,
            colnames=colnames,
            source=f,
            creds=self._credentials(),
            options=self.copy_options)
        )
```

By adding the check `if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0`, we ensure that we only try to get the length of `self.columns` when it is not `None`. This change should fix the bug described in the GitHub issue and allow the test `test_s3_copy_with_nonetype_columns` to pass successfully.
