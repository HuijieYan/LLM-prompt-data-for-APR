### Analysis:
- The buggy function `copy` in the `S3CopyToTable` class within the `luigi.contrib.redshift` module is not handling the case where `self.columns` is `None`. This results in a `TypeError` when trying to get the length of `None`.
- The failing test `test_s3_copy_with_nonetype_columns` aims to test the behavior of the `S3CopyToTable` class when `columns` attribute is `None`.
- The error message indicates a `TypeError` due to trying to get the length of a `NoneType` object.
- The GitHub issue highlights this bug and suggests a fix by checking if `self.columns` is not `None` before trying to get its length.

### Bug Cause:
The bug occurs because the `copy` function is assuming that `self.columns` will always have a list of columns, without handling the case where it might be `None`.

### Suggested Fix:
To fix the bug, we should modify the `copy` function to check if `self.columns` is not `None` before trying to get its length. This will prevent the `TypeError` when `columns` is `None`.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

By adding the check `if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0`, we ensure that the code will only proceed with finding the `colnames` if `self.columns` is not `None`, fixing the bug as per the suggestion in the GitHub issue.
