### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `copy` is trying to check the length of `self.columns`, but due to the `columns` parameter being set to `None` in one of the test cases, it is causing a `TypeError: object of type 'NoneType' has no len()`.
2. The issue is related to the `if len(self.columns) > 0:` line of code, where `self.columns` is sometimes `None`.
3. The error message indicates that the `columns` attribute is `None`, causing the `len()` check to fail. The expected behavior should be to handle the case where `self.columns` is `None`, considering it as an empty list.
4. To fix the bug, we should first check if `self.columns` is not `None` before attempting to get its length.

### Bug Fix:
```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns is not None and len(self.columns) > 0:  # Check if columns is not None
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

By adding the condition `if self.columns is not None`, we ensure that the code does not throw an error when `self.columns` is `None`. This fix will address the bug and allow the function to handle cases where `columns` is `None`.
