### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `copy` within the `S3CopyToTable` class is failing due to a TypeError caused by trying to call `len()` on a NoneType object in the `self.columns` attribute.
2. The variable `colnames` is being set to an empty string initially, and then conditionally assigned a comma-separated string of column names from `self.columns`. However, this assignment is flawed as it doesn't handle the case where `self.columns` is None.
3. The bug causes the test case `test_s3_copy_with_nonetype_columns` to fail with a TypeError due to the attempted comparison of NoneType with an integer value in the `if len(self.columns) > 0` line inside the `copy` function.
4. To fix this bug, we need to ensure that `self.columns` is not None before attempting to get its length. One possible solution is to modify the condition to `if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0`.
5. By making this change, we can prevent the TypeError and ensure that the `colnames` variable is properly set.

### Bug Fix:
```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.
    
    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)
    
    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options())
    )
```

By updating the buggy function as shown above, we address the TypeError issue by checking if `self.columns` is not None before attempting to get its length. This change ensures that the function functions correctly even when `self.columns` is not provided, satisfying the expected input/output values and resolving the GitHub issue.
