### Bug Analysis:
1. The buggy function `copy` in the `S3CopyToTable` class is failing due to a `TypeError: object of type 'NoneType' has no len()` error.
2. The issue arises when trying to check the length of `self.columns` without verifying if it is not `None`.
3. The `copy` function is expecting a non-null value for `self.columns` to proceed with further operations. However, in the failing test, `self.columns` is set to `None`, causing the bug.
4. The suggested fix from the GitHub issue is to modify the condition `if len(self.columns) > 0:` to `if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:` to ensure that `self.columns` is not `None` before checking its length.

### Bug Fix:
To address the bug and make the function robust against `None` values for `self.columns`, the condition inside the `copy` function needs to be updated as suggested in the GitHub issue.

### Corrected Version:
```python
class S3CopyToTable(rdbms.CopyToTable, _CredentialsMixin):
    def copy_options(self):
        # Please ignore the body of this function

    def copy(self, cursor, f):
        """
        Defines copying from s3 into redshift.
    
        If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
        """
        logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
        colnames = ''
        if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:  # Check if self.columns is not None before getting its length
            colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
            colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)
    
        cursor.execute("""
         COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
         CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
         {options}
         ;""".format(
            table=self.table,
            colnames=colnames,
            source=f,
            creds=self._credentials(),
            options=self.copy_options)
        )
```

With this modification, the function will first check if `self.columns` is not `None` before proceeding with getting its length, resolving the `TypeError` issue.
