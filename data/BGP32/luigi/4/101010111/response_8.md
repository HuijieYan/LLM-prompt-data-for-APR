The cause of the bug in the provided function `copy(self, cursor, f)` is due to the comparison `if len(self.columns) > 0:` where `self.columns` is `None` according to the failing test case. This comparison tries to get the length of a `NoneType` object, resulting in the `TypeError: object of type 'NoneType' has no len()` error.

To fix this bug, we need to check if `self.columns` is not `None` before checking its length. We can modify the comparison to `if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:` which first verifies if `self.columns` is not equal to `None` before attempting to calculate its length.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

By making this change, the function will handle the case where `self.columns` is `None` correctly, preventing the `TypeError` that occurred in the failing test case. This fix addresses the bug reported in the GitHub issue related to Redshift COPY failures when columns are not provided.
