### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `copy` is failing due to trying to check the length of `self.columns`, which is `None` in the failing test case.
2. The issue is related to the `copy` function in the `S3CopyToTable` class of `luigi/contrib/redshift.py`.
3. The error message indicates a `TypeError` occurring when trying to get the length of `NoneType` object.
4. The suggested fix is to check if `self.columns` is not `None` before trying to get its length.

### Correction:
```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns is not None and len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

By adding the condition `if self.columns is not None and len(self.columns) > 0:`, we ensure that the length of `self.columns` is only checked if it is not `None`. This correction should resolve the `TypeError` issue when `self.columns` is `None`.
