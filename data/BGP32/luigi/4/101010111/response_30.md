### Analyzing the buggy function and related information:

1. **Buggy Function**:
   - The function `copy` within the `S3CopyToTable` class in `luigi/contrib/redshift.py` is responsible for copying data from S3 to Redshift.
   - The bug occurs when `self.columns` is `None` and the function tries to check its length, resulting in a `TypeError`.

2. **Error Location**:
   - The bug is located at line 338 where the function checks the length of `self.columns`.

3. **Cause of the Bug**:
   - The bug is caused by `self.columns` being `None`, which leads to the `TypeError` when trying to get its length.
   - The failing test verifies that when `columns=None`, the function encounters the `TypeError`.

4. **Bug Fix Strategy**:
   - Update the line where the length of `self.columns` is checked to first validate if `self.columns` exists and then check its length.
   - This way, when `self.columns` is `None`, the length check will not be executed.

### Corrected Version of the Function:

```python
# Corrected version of the buggy function
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from S3 into Redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:  # Updated condition to avoid TypeError
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
``` 

By updating the condition to first check if `self.columns` exists (is not `None`), the corrected function avoids the `TypeError` when `self.columns` is `None`. This change aligns with the suggested fix on the GitHub issue as well.
