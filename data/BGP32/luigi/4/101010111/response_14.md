### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `copy` in the `S3CopyToTable` class is failing due to a `TypeError` when it tries to check the length of `self.columns` which is `None`.
2. The issue seems to be related to a recent change in the source code based on a GitHub issue mentioned.
3. The cause of the bug is that when `self.columns` is `None`, the code directly tries to check its length without first verifying if it is not `None`. This causes the `TypeError`.
4. To fix the bug, we need to add a check for `self.columns` before checking its length to avoid the `TypeError`.

### Updated Corrected Function:
```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:  # Added check for self.columns
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

By adding the conditional check `if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0`, we ensure that we only try to get the length of `self.columns` when it is not `None`. This fix should resolve the `TypeError` issue mentioned in the GitHub problem.
