## Bug Analysis:
1. The bug occurs in the `copy` function of the `S3CopyToTable` class in the `luigi/contrib/redshift.py` file.
2. The error message indicates that a `TypeError` is raised due to comparing the length of `NoneType` object in `if len(self.columns) > 0:` line.
3. The expected input values include `f` as a string, `self` as an instance of `DummyS3CopyToTableKey`, `cursor` and `cursor.execute` as MagicMock objects, `self.table` as a string, and `self.copy_options` as an empty string. The expected output is an empty string for `colnames`.
4. The GitHub issue suggests updating the line to `if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:` to handle the case where `self.columns` is `None`. This change is necessary to prevent the `TypeError`.

## Bug Fix:
To address the bug and align with the GitHub issue's suggestion, we should modify the condition `if len(self.columns) > 0:` to `if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:` to handle the case where `self.columns` is `None`. This change will prevent the `TypeError` when trying to calculate the length of a `NoneType` object.

## Corrected Version:
```python
# The corrected version of the buggy function
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:  # Check if columns is not None before getting its length
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

By making this change, we ensure that the `self.columns` attribute is not `None` before trying to compute its length, resolving the `TypeError` and meeting the expected behavior.
