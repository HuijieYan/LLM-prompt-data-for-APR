### Identify the bug
The bug in the `copy` function is caused by trying to check the length of `self.columns` without first checking if `self.columns` is not None. This leads to a `TypeError` when `self.columns` is None.

### Cause of the bug
The bug occurs due to the line:
```python
if len(self.columns) > 0:
```
This line attempts to get the length of `self.columns` without checking if `self.columns` is not None. When `self.columns` is None, trying to get the length of it results in a `TypeError`.

### Fixing the bug
To fix the bug, we need to first check if `self.columns` is not None before trying to get its length. We can update the line to:
```python
if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:
```
This way, we ensure that `self.columns` is not None before trying to check its length.

### Corrected code
Here is the corrected version of the `copy` function:
```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options())
    )
```

By making this change, we ensure that the length of `self.columns` is only checked if `self.columns` is not None, avoiding the `TypeError` that occurred previously.
