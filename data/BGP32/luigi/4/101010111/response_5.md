## Analysis:
1. The buggy function `copy` is trying to access the length of `self.columns` without checking if it is `None`, which leads to a `TypeError` when `columns` is `None`.
2. The expected behavior is to handle the case when `self.columns` is `None` gracefully without causing an error.
3. The error message provided clearly indicates that it is a `TypeError` caused by trying to get the length of a `NoneType` object.
4. To fix the bug, we need to modify the conditional check for `self.columns` before attempting to access its length.
5. The GitHub issue related to this bug suggests the same solution of checking if `self.columns` is truthy before getting its length.

## Bug Fix:
```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

By adding the `if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:` check before accessing the length of `self.columns`, we ensure that the buggy function does not throw an error when `columns` is `None`. This fix addresses the issue reported in the GitHub bug report and should now handle the case where `columns` is not provided properly.
