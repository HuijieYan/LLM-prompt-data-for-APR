## Identified Bug:
The bug in the provided function is due to the comparison of `self.columns` with the integer 0. When `self.columns` is `None`, trying to check its length using `len()` throws a `TypeError` as `NoneType` has no length. This comparison is causing the function to fail when `columns` are None.

## Solution:
To fix the bug, we need to modify the if condition to first check if `self.columns` is not None before comparing its length. This change will prevent the `TypeError` when `self.columns` is None.

## Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns is not None and len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options())
    )
```

With this correction, the function will first check if `self.columns` is not None before comparing its length, ensuring that the function runs smoothly even when `columns` are None. This fix will address the TypeError mentioned in the GitHub issue as well.
