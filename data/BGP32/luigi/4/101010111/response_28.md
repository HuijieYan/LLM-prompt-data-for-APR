## Fixing the buggy function

### Analyzing the bug
The buggy function `copy` in the `S3CopyToTable` class is failing due to the usage of `self.columns` without checking if it is `None`. The error message indicates a `TypeError: object of type 'NoneType' has no len()`, which happens when trying to get the length of a `NoneType`. The function is assuming `self.columns` will always have a value, leading to the bug.

### Strategies for fixing the bug
To fix the bug, we need to modify the condition where `self.columns` is being checked for its length. We should first check if `self.columns` is not `None` before proceeding to access its length.

### Corrected Version of the Function

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns is not None and len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options())
    )
```

### Explanation
In the corrected version of the function, we added a check `if self.columns is not None` before evaluating `len(self.columns)`. This change ensures that the function does not attempt to get the length of `self.columns` when it is `None`, preventing the `TypeError`.

By making this modification, the function now handles the case where `self.columns` might be `None` and avoids the error pointed out in the failing test.

This corrected version satisfies the expected input/output values and resolves the issue reported in the GitHub thread.
