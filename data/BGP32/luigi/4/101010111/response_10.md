### Bug analysis
1. The buggy function 'copy' in the class 'S3CopyToTable' is supposed to perform a copy operation from an S3 location to a Redshift table. The bug occurs when the 'columns' parameter is passed as 'None' resulting in a 'TypeError' due to trying to get the length of 'NoneType'.
2. The 'copy' function constructs a 'COPY' query using the passed parameters and tries to execute it using the 'cursor'. The issue arises from the incorrect handling of 'columns' being 'None' within the function.
3. The bug causes a 'TypeError' as 'len(None)' is being called when constructing the 'COPY' query. The expected behavior would be to detect if 'columns' is not 'None' before trying to get its length.
4. To fix the bug, it is essential to check if 'self.columns' is not 'None' before proceeding to calculate its length. This will prevent the 'TypeError' when constructing the 'COPY' query.

### Bug fix
```python
# The corrected version of the buggy function
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns is not None and len(self.columns) > 0:  # Check for NoneType
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

By adding the condition `if self.columns is not None and len(self.columns) > 0:` before processing 'self.columns', we ensure that only when 'self.columns' is not 'None', its length is calculated. This correction prevents the 'TypeError' from occurring when 'columns' is 'None'.

The corrected version of the function should resolve the issue and pass the failing test, maintaining the expected input/output values and satisfying the GitHub issue's requirements.
