## Solution

### Analysis:
The error occurs due to the comparison `if len(self.columns) > 0` where `self.columns` is None, causing a `TypeError`. The issue arises when columns are not provided, and the code does not handle this case correctly.

### Solution:
To fix this bug, we need to check if `self.columns` is not None before attempting to get its length.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options())
    )
```

This corrected version includes a check `if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0` before trying to get the length of `self.columns`, avoiding the `TypeError` in case `self.columns` is None. This fix aligns with the suggested solution in the GitHub issue.
