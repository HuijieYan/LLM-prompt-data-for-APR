## Fixing the buggy function

### Analysis:
- The buggy function `copy` is failing due to an TypeError caused by trying to get the length of `self.columns`, which is None.
- The error message points to this line: `if len(self.columns) > 0:`
- The issue on GitHub suggests changing it to `if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:` to handle cases where `self.columns` is None.

### Fix:
1. Modify the line causing the error to address the NoneType issue by checking if `self.columns` is not None before checking its length.

### Corrected Version:
```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: luigi/contrib/redshift.py

# The declaration of the class containing the corrected function
class S3CopyToTable(rdbms.CopyToTable, _CredentialsMixin):
    # This function from the same class is called by the buggy function
    def copy_options(self):
        # Please ignore the body of this function

    # The corrected version of the buggy function
    def copy(self, cursor, f):
        """
        Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

        If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
        """
        logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
        colnames = ''
        if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:
            colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
            colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

        cursor.execute("""
         COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
         CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
         {options}
         ;""".format(
            table=self.table,
            colnames=colnames,
            source=f,
            creds=self._credentials(),
            options=self.copy_options)
        )
```

By applying this correction, the function will now correctly handle cases where `self.columns` is None and avoid the TypeError experienced in the failing test scenario.
