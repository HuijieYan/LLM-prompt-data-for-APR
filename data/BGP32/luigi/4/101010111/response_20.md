### Analysis:
1. **Bug Location:** The bug is located in the `copy` function of the `S3CopyToTable` class in the `luigi/contrib/redshift.py` file.
   
2. **Potential Cause:** The error occurs due to the comparison of `None` with an integer in the condition `if len(self.columns) > 0` when `self.columns` is None.

3. **Bug Explanation:**
   - **Buggy Function:** In the `copy` function, if `self.columns` is None, the comparison `len(self.columns) > 0` raises a `TypeError` because `None` does not have a length property (`len()`).
   - **Related Functions:** The issue relates to handling `None` value for columns when constructing the `COPY` command.
   - **Error Message:** The error message indicates a `TypeError` due to `NoneType` having no length.

4. **Bug Fix Strategy:** To fix the bug, handle the case where `self.columns` is `None` separately before attempting to get its length to prevent the `TypeError`.

### Bug-fixed Version:
```python
class S3CopyToTable(rdbms.CopyToTable, _CredentialsMixin):

    def copy_options(self):
        # Please ignore the body of this function

    def copy(self, cursor, f):
        """
        Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

        If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
        """
        logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
        colnames = ''
        if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:  # Check if self.columns is not None before getting its length
            colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
            colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

        cursor.execute(
            """
            COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
            CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
            {options}
            ;""".format(
                table=self.table,
                colnames=colnames,
                source=f,
                creds=self._credentials(),
                options=self.copy_options)
        )
```

Now, with the addition of `if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0`, the bug should be resolved, and the code will prevent the `TypeError` when `self.columns` is `None`. This change aligns with the suggested solution in the GitHub issue.
