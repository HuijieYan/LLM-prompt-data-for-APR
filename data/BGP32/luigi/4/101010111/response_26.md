### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `copy` is attempting to check the length of `self.columns` without verifying if it is not None.
2. The error message indicates a `TypeError` due to trying to get the length of a `NoneType` object.
3. The issue on GitHub highlights that the bug occurs when columns are not provided, causing the `TypeError`.
4. The suggested solution is to modify the line to explicitly check if `self.columns` is not None before attempting to get its length.

### Strategy for fixing the bug:
1. Update the buggy line to check if `self.columns` is not None before checking its length.
2. Ensure that the function handles the case when `self.columns` is None.

### The corrected version of the function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns is not None and len(self.columns) > 0:  # Check if columns are not None
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options())
    )
```

By updating the line to check if `self.columns` is not None before trying to access its length, the bug should be fixed. The corrected version should now handle the case when columns are not provided.
