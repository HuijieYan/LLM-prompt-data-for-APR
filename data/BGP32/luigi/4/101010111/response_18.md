### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `copy` is expecting `self.columns` to be a list, but when `columns` is None, it causes a `TypeError`.
2. The root cause is due to the comparison `if len(self.columns) > 0` where `self.columns` is None which does not support the `len()` operation.
3. The GitHub issue provides insight into the problem and suggests changing the condition to `if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0`.
4. We need to update the condition to check if `self.columns` is not None before checking its length.
5. Implement the suggested change to fix the bug.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:  # Update the condition to check if self.columns is not None
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

By implementing this corrected version and updating the condition to check if `self.columns` is not None before getting its length, the bug causing the `TypeError` when `columns` is None will be fixed.
