### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `copy()` is trying to check the length of `self.columns`, but it throws a `TypeError: object of type 'NoneType' has no len()` because `self.columns` is `None`.
2. The issue is related to a recent pull request in the Luigi repository, as mentioned in the GitHub issue.
3. The error occurs when trying to access the length of `self.columns` without checking if it is `None`.
4. To fix the bug, we need to check if `self.columns` is not `None` before trying to get its length.

### Correction:
Here is the corrected version of the `copy()` function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options())
    )
```

In the corrected version, `if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:` is used to check if `self.columns` is not `None` before attempting to get its length. This modification ensures that the code doesn't break even if `self.columns` is `None`.
