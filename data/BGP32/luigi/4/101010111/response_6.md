### Analysis
1. The buggy function `copy` in the `S3CopyToTable` class is failing due to a `TypeError` related to the `columns` attribute being `None`.
2. The error occurs specifically in the line where the length of `self.columns` is checked.
3. The cause of the bug is that the code does not handle the case where `self.columns` can be `None`, leading to the `TypeError`.
4. To fix the bug, we need to check if `self.columns` is not `None` before attempting to get its length.
5. The suggestion from the GitHub issue is valid and aligns with the proposed fix.

### Bug Fix Strategy
1. Check if `self.columns` is not `None` before trying to get its length.
2. Update the condition to `if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0`.

### Corrected Version
```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:  # Fix for handling columns being None
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options())
    )
```

By applying this fix, the corrected version of the `copy` function should now handle the case where `self.columns` is `None` appropriately and pass the failing test case.
