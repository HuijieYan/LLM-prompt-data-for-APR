## Fixing the buggy function

### Issue Analysis
The buggy function `copy` is failing due to a TypeError caused by trying to get the length of `self.columns`, which is `None`. This behavior leads to the error message `object of type 'NoneType' has no len()`. The expected behavior for the function is to only process `colnames` if `self.columns` is not `None`.

The proposed fix involves checking if `self.columns` is not `None` before attempting to get its length to avoid the TypeError.

### Updated Function
Here is the corrected version of the `copy` function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns is not None and len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options())
    )
```

### Changes Made
1. Added a check `if self.columns is not None and len(self.columns) > 0:` before attempting to process `colnames`.
2. Corrected the method call `self.copy_options` to `self.copy_options()`.

By making these changes, the function is now able to handle cases where `self.columns` is `None` without raising a TypeError and should pass the failing test case.
