### Analysis:
1. The `copy` function is attempting to check the length of `self.columns`, but if `self.columns` is `None`, it will throw a `TypeError` because `NoneType` has no length attribute.
2. The issue was related to changes made in the `copy_options` function where it doesn't return anything and was passed as a function reference.
3. The error message indicates that the function is trying to get the length of a `NoneType` object, leading to a `TypeError`. The expected behavior is to only check the length if `self.columns` is not `None`. The provided GitHub issue also suggests a fix for this bug.
4. To fix the bug, we should check if `self.columns` is not `None` before trying to get its length.
5. Below is the corrected version of the `copy` function:

### Corrected Version:
```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:  # Check if self.columns is not None before getting its length
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options())  # Call the copy_options function instead of passing it as a reference
    )
```

By checking if `self.columns` is not `None` before trying to get its length, we avoid the `TypeError` when `self.columns` is `None`. This fix aligns with the suggestion in the GitHub issue provided.
