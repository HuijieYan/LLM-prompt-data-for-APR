### Analysis
1. The buggy function `copy` within the `S3CopyToTable` class of the `luigi.contrib.redshift` module is attempting to check the length of `self.columns`, but the issue arises when `columns` is `None`.
2. The error message indicates a `TypeError` when trying to get the length of a `NoneType` object.
3. The function is expecting to have `self.columns` as a list of column names, but when it is passed as `None`, the bug occurs.
4. To fix the bug, we should first check if `self.columns` is not None before trying to get its length.

### Correction
```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0: # Check if self.columns is not None before getting its length
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

This correction will prevent the `TypeError` by first checking if `self.columns` is not `None` before trying to access its length. This aligns with the suggested solution in the related GitHub issue.
