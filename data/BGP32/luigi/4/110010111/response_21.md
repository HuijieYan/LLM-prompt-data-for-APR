### Analyzing the buggy function

The buggy function `copy` in the `S3CopyToTable` class from `luigi/contrib/redshift.py` is causing a `TypeError` when `self.columns` is `None`. The expected behavior is to handle the case where `self.columns` is `None` and prevent the `TypeError`.

The error message indicates that the issue arises when attempting to retrieve the length of `self.columns`, which is `None`. The expected behavior is to check if `self.columns` is not `None` before trying to access its length.

The GitHub issue suggests a possible solution to address this bug by modifying the condition to `if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0` to prevent the `TypeError` when `self.columns` is `None`.

### Strategy for fixing the bug

To resolve the bug, we should update the condition in the `copy` function to check if `self.columns` exists and has a non-zero length before proceeding with the `colnames` assignment.

### Corrected version of the buggy function

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:  # Check if columns is not None before accessing its length
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

By making this change, the `TypeError` caused by attempting to get the length of a `NoneType` will be avoided when `self.columns` is `None`. This correction aligns with the suggested solution in the GitHub issue.
