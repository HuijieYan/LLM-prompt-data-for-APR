### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `copy` inside the `S3CopyToTable` class in `luigi/contrib/redshift.py` is throwing a `TypeError` when `self.columns` is `None` during execution.
2. The error occurs when trying to check the length of `self.columns`, which is not handled properly for the case when it is `None`.
3. The issue on GitHub suggests modifying the condition to check if `self.columns` is not `None` before checking its length to avoid this error.
4. The fix involves updating the condition to handle the case when `self.columns` is `None`.

### Bug Fix:
```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns is not None and len(self.columns) > 0:  # Fix: Added a condition to check if self.columns is not None
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

This fix will prevent the `TypeError` when `self.columns` is `None`, making the function more robust.

By making this adjustment, the function will handle the case where `self.columns` is `None` before attempting to check its length, as suggested in the GitHub issue.
