### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `copy` within the `S3CopyToTable` class in the `luigi/contrib/redshift.py` file is causing a `TypeError` when trying to determine the length of `self.columns`.
2. The error is occurring at line 338 where `len(self.columns)` is used without checking for `None` value.
3. The cause of the bug is that when `columns` is set to `None`, the `if len(self.columns) > 0:` condition fails due to `NoneType` not having a length. This issue was identified in a GitHub issue stating that this behavior was introduced in version 2.7.1 of Luigi.
4. To fix the bug, we need to modify the condition to `if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:` to handle the case where `self.columns` is `None`.
5. Based on the above analysis, the corrected version of the buggy function is provided below.

### Correction:
```python
# The corrected version of the buggy function
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:  # Check if columns is not None before getting its length
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

By making this change to the condition, the function will now properly handle the case where `self.columns` is `None`, and the test case should pass without raising a `TypeError`.
