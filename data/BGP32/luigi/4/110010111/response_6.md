### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `copy` is part of the `S3CopyToTable` class in the `luigi/contrib/redshift.py` file.
2. The error occurs when trying to check the length of `self.columns`, which is `None`, causing a `TypeError`. This error prevents the correct execution of the `copy` function.
3. The error message indicates that a `TypeError` is raised because an object of type `NoneType` does not support the `len()` function.
4. To fix the bug, we need to modify the condition where the length of `self.columns` is checked. The suggestion from the GitHub issue is to update the condition to `if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0`.
5. By updating the condition as per the suggestion, we can avoid the `TypeError` and correctly handle the case where `self.columns` is `None`.

### Bug Fix:
```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:  # Fixed the condition to handle NoneType
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

By correcting the buggy function with the updated conditional check, we can avoid the `TypeError` and ensure the function works correctly, satisfying the expected input/output values and resolving the GitHub issue.
