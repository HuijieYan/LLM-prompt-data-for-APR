## Bug Analysis:

1. **Buggy Function**: The `copy` function within the `S3CopyToTable` class is meant to perform a COPY operation from S3 to Redshift. The bug occurs due to the `self.columns` attribute being `None`.
   
2. **Error**: The error message indicates a `TypeError: object of type 'NoneType' has no len()`. This error occurs when trying to find the length of a `None` object.
   
3. **Cause of Bug**: The `copy` function assumes that `self.columns` will contain a list of columns to be used in the `COPY` operation. When `self.columns` is `None`, the code attempts to find the length of a `NoneType`, which causes the error.
   
4. **Strategy for Fixing**:
   - **Check for None**: Update the condition from `if len(self.columns) > 0` to `if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0` to first check if `self.columns` is not `None`.
   
5. **GitHub Issue**: The GitHub issue suggests a similar fix to handle cases where `columns` are not provided. It recommends changing the condition to `if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0`.
   
## Corrected Version:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into Redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:  # Check if self.columns is not None before finding its length
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

By applying this fix, the code will first verify that `self.columns` is not `None` before trying to find its length, avoiding the `TypeError` caused by trying to find the length of a `NoneType`.
