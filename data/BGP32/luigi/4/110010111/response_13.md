### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `copy` in the `S3CopyToTable` class is causing a `TypeError` when `self.columns` is `None`.
2. The error message indicates that the object of type 'NoneType' has no length, which suggests that `self.columns` is `None`.
3. The function is trying to check the length of `self.columns` without verifying if it is `None` or not, causing the error.
4. The proposed fix from the GitHub issue suggests changing the condition to `if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0` to avoid this issue.

### Correction:
```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

By adding the condition `if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0`, we ensure that the length is checked only when `self.columns` is not `None`, resolving the `TypeError` issue.
