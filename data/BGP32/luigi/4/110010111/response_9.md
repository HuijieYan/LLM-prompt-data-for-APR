### Analysis:
1. **Buggy Function Relationship**:
   - The buggy function `copy` is a method of the `S3CopyToTable` class, which is a template task for inserting a dataset into Redshift from S3.
   - It is related to the RedshiftTarget as it uses a cursor from RedshiftTarget to execute SQL queries.

2. **Error Location**:
   - The error occurs at line 7 of the buggy function `copy` where it tries to check the length of `self.columns`, which is None.

3. **Cause of the Bug**:
   - The buggy function attempts to check the length of `self.columns` without first verifying if `self.columns` is not None. This results in a `TypeError` when trying to get the length of a NoneType object.
   - The expected behavior is to only check the length of `self.columns` when it is not None. The error message reflects this issue.

4. **Strategy for Fixing the Bug**:
   - Modify the conditional statement to first check if `self.columns` is not None before checking its length.

### Updated Code:
```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:  # Fixed the condition to check if self.columns is not None
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

By updating the conditional statement to first check if `self.columns` is not None, the code will no longer throw a `TypeError` when trying to get the length of `self.columns`. This fix aligns with the suggested solution in the GitHub issue.
