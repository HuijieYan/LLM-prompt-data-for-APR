### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `copy` is expecting `self.columns` to be a list, and it is trying to get the length of it. However, in the failing test case, `columns=None`, which is causing the error when trying to check `len(self.columns)`.
2. The error message indicates a `TypeError` due to attempting to get the length of a `NoneType` object.
3. The cause of the bug is the assumption that `self.columns` will always be a list, leading to the error when it is `None`. The expected behavior is to handle the case when `columns` is `None`.
4. To fix the bug, we need to update the condition checking the length of `self.columns` to also validate if `self.columns` exists before checking its length.

### Correction:
```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:  # Fixed condition to check if columns exist and then get length
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

By updating the condition to check if `self.columns` exists before trying to get its length, we ensure that the `copy` function can handle cases where `columns` is `None`. This correction should resolve the `TypeError` caused by the bug.
