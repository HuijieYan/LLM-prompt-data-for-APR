## Analysis
The buggy function `copy` is failing due to the comparison `if len(self.columns) > 0` where `self.columns` is set to `None`. The error message indicates that a `TypeError` is being raised because `NoneType` does not have a `len()` method. This issue is directly related to the GitHub issue mentioned, where the behavior of handling `None` values in `columns` attribute needs to be corrected.

## Bug Cause
The root cause of the bug is that the comparison `if len(self.columns) > 0` is performed without checking if `self.columns` is actually `None`. As per the behavior described in the GitHub issue, when `columns` is intentionally set as `None` to prohibit table creation, the code should handle this case differently.

## Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to modify the condition `if len(self.columns) > 0` to first check if `self.columns` is not `None` before checking its length. This way, we can avoid the `TypeError` when `self.columns` is `None`. By considering the scenario where `columns` might be intentionally set as `None`, we can make the code more robust.

## Corrected Version
Below is the corrected version of the `copy` function considering the fix strategy mentioned:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns is not None and len(self.columns) > 0:  # Check if columns is not None
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

By making this modification to the condition before checking the length of `self.columns`, we ensure that the function will handle the case where `columns` is set to `None` appropriately. This corrected version should address the bug and pass the failing test cases.
