### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `copy` inside the `S3CopyToTable` class is trying to check the length of `self.columns` which could potentially be `None`. This causes a `TypeError` when trying to calculate the length of a `NoneType` object.
2. The error message clearly states that the bug is due to trying to get the length of a `NoneType` object.
3. The bug occurs when the `self.columns` attribute is `None`, but the function is trying to check its length.
4. To fix the bug, we need to ensure that `self.columns` is not `None` before attempting to check its length.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
Add a check to ensure that `self.columns` is not `None` before trying to get its length. This will prevent the `TypeError` from occurring.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns is not None and len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

With this correction, the function will first check if `self.columns` is not `None` before proceeding to get its length, avoiding the `TypeError` and addressing the bug described in the GitHub issue.
