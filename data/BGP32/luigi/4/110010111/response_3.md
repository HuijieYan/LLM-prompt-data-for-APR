### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `copy` within the `S3CopyToTable` class in the `luigi/contrib/redshift.py` file is causing a `TypeError` when checking the length of `self.columns` since it is `None`.
2. The error occurs when the condition `if len(self.columns) > 0:` is executed.
3. The cause of the bug is that the `columns` attribute is not handled being `None`, resulting in the `TypeError`.
4. To fix the bug, we need to modify the condition to explicitly check if `self.columns` is not `None` before checking its length.
5. Providing a corrected version of the function below.

### Suggested Fix:
```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns is not None and len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

By making the modification to check if `self.columns` is not `None` before proceeding to check its length, the function should now handle the case where `columns` attribute is `None` correctly and avoid the `TypeError`.
