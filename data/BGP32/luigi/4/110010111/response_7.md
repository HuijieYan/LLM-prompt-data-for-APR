### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `copy` in the `S3CopyToTable` class is throwing a `TypeError: object of type 'NoneType' has no len()` when trying to check the length of `self.columns` which is set to `None`.
2. The function is checking for the length of `self.columns` without validating if it is `None` or not, causing the error.
3. The error message and expected input/output values indicate that when `self.columns` is `None`, the bug occurs as it does not have the attribute `len`.
4. The bug can be fixed by adding a check to ensure `self.columns` is not `None` before checking its length.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
Add a check to ensure `self.columns` is not `None` before checking its length in the function.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:  # Check if self.columns is not None before checking the length
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

By adding the check for `self.columns` before trying to get its length, the function will now handle the case where `self.columns` is `None` without throwing an error.
