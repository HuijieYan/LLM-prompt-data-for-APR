### Analysis:
1. The error occurs due to `TypeError: object of type 'NoneType' has no len()`, indicating that the `self.columns` attribute is `None` when checked for its length in the `copy` function.
2. The `DummyS3CopyToTableKey` class is used as the `self` parameter, containing a `columns` attribute that is `None`.
3. The buggy function `copy` tries to construct a string `colnames` by joining the column names from `self.columns`, but since `self.columns` is `None`, it causes the TypeError.
4. The bug can be fixed by checking if `self.columns` is not `None` before trying to access its length.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
Modify the logic in the `copy` function to handle cases where `self.columns` is `None` by checking if it's not `None` before attempting to access its length.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
    def copy(self, cursor, f):
        """
        Defines copying from s3 into redshift.
    
        If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
        """
        logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
        colnames = ''
        if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:
            colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
            colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)
    
        cursor.execute("""
         COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
         CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
         {options}
         ;""".format(
            table=self.table,
            colnames=colnames,
            source=f,
            creds=self._credentials(),
            options=self.copy_options)
        )
```

By adding the condition `if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:` before constructing `colnames`, the corrected function will handle cases where `self.columns` is `None` without causing any errors.
