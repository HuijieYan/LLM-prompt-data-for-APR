### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `copy` in the `S3CopyToTable` class is supposed to copy data from an S3 source into a Redshift table. The bug occurs when the `self.columns` attribute is `None`, causing a `TypeError` when trying to check its length.
2. The potential error location is where the length of `self.columns` is checked.
3. The cause of the bug is the presence of `None` type in `self.columns` when checking its length. This leads to the `TypeError: object of type 'NoneType' has no len()`. The expected behavior is to allow `self.columns` to be `None` and handle it properly in the code. This issue was reported on GitHub (Issue link: https://github.com/spotify/luigi/pull/2245/files#diff-778ea3db4cccaf4de6564889c5eb670fR338).
4. To fix the bug, we need to modify the condition checking the length of `self.columns` to handle the case where `self.columns` is `None`. By changing the condition to `if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0`, we can make sure that the length is only checked when `self.columns` is not `None`.
5. Here is the corrected version of the `copy` function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:  # Check if self.columns is not None before checking length
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
``` 

By updating the condition to handle `self.columns` being `None`, the function should now work correctly in cases where `columns` attribute is not provided.
