### Identification of potential error locations
1. The line causing the error is `if len(self.columns) > 0`.
2. Additionally, the line `colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])` may also lead to issues if `self.columns` is `None`.

### Cause of the bug
- The `TypeError: object of type 'NoneType' has no len()` error occurs because the `self.columns` attribute is `None`, and the code attempts to check its length directly with `len(self.columns)`.
- The expectation for handling a `None` value in `self.columns` is not implemented, which causes the error.
- The observation that the bug started occurring after a specific pull request provides a direct indication of the problematic change.

### Strategy for fixing the bug
1. Update the condition `if len(self.columns) > 0` to `if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0` to address both the `NoneType` and length check.
2. Implement a check for `None` values before operating on `self.columns` to prevent errors.

### Corrected version of the function
```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)
        
    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

By updating the condition to `if self.columns:` before attempting to access the length, the function now correctly handles the case when `self.columns` is `None`. This change addresses the bug and aligns with the suggestion provided in the GitHub issue.
