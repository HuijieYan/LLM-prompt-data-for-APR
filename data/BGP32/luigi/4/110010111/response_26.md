### Correction:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns is not None and len(self.columns) > 0:  # Check if self.columns is not None before getting its length
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

### Explanation:
The bug is caused by the `TypeError` that occurs when trying to get the length of `self.columns` without first checking if it's `None`. By adding a check to ensure `self.columns` is not `None` before getting its length, we prevent this error from happening.

### Strategy:
- Modify the `if` condition to check if `self.columns` is not `None` before checking its length.
- Update the condition to `if self.columns is not None and len(self.columns) > 0:` to ensure proper handling of cases where `self.columns` is `None`.

By making these adjustments, the corrected function will not throw a `TypeError` when trying to get the length of `self.columns` if it is `None`.

This correction aligns with the expected input/output values and addresses the GitHub issue related to this bug.
