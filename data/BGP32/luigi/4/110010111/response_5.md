### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `copy` in the `S3CopyToTable` class in the `luigi/contrib/redshift.py` file is supposed to handle copying data from an S3 path into a Redshift table. The issue occurs due to the `TypeError: object of type 'NoneType' has no len()` when checking the length of `self.columns`.
   
2. The potential error location is the if statement `if len(self.columns) > 0:` where `self.columns` is assumed to contain a list of columns. However, if `self.columns` is `None`, the code will raise the mentioned `TypeError`.

### Explanation:
The cause of the bug:
- In the failing test scenario, the input `columns` is `None` which is acceptable as it means no columns are provided.
- The buggy function fails to handle the case when `self.columns` is `None`, resulting in the `TypeError`.
- The code assumes that `self.columns` will always be a list, leading to the incorrect length check causing the error.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
- Modify the condition in the if statement to check if `self.columns` is not `None` before trying to get its length.
- This change will allow the code to handle the case when no columns are provided without throwing an error.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:  # Check if columns is not None before getting its length
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
``` 

This corrected version adds a check for `self.columns` to prevent the `TypeError` when `columns` is `None`, ensuring the function works as expected even when no columns are provided.
