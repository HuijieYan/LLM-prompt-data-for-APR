### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `copy` in the `S3CopyToTable` class of the `luigi/contrib/redshift.py` file is causing a `TypeError` when `self.columns` is `None`.
2. The function is attempting to check the length of `self.columns` directly without verifying if it is `None` or not, leading to the error.
3. The cause of the bug is the direct length check of `self.columns` without considering the case when it is `None`. The GitHub issue suggests a potential fix to address this scenario.
4. The strategy for fixing the bug involves checking if `self.columns` is not `None` before trying to get its length.
5. Below is the corrected version of the buggy function:

### Corrected Version:
```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns is not None and len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

By adding the `if self.columns is not None and` condition before checking the length of `self.columns`, the buggy function will now handle the case where `self.columns` is `None` without causing a `TypeError`. This correction aligns with the suggested solution in the GitHub issue.
