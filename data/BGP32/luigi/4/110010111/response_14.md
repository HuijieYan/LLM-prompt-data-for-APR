### Analysis:
1. **Buggy Function & Class Relationship**:
   - The buggy function `copy` is a method of the `S3CopyToTable` class in the `luigi.contrib.redshift` module. It is responsible for copying data from S3 into Redshift.
  
2. **Error Location**:
   - The error occurs in the `if len(self.columns) > 0:` line within the `copy` function, where it tries to check the length of `self.columns`, which may be `None`.

3. **Cause of the Bug**:
   - The bug occurs because the function assumes `self.columns` will always be a list or iterable to check its length. When `columns` is set to `None` as in the failing test, it raises a `TypeError` trying to get the length of a `NoneType`.
   - To pass the failing test, we need to handle the case when `self.columns` is `None` before checking its length.

4. **Bug Fix Strategy**:
   - We need to add a condition to check if `self.columns` is not `None` before attempting to get its length. This will prevent the `TypeError` when `columns` is `None`.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from S3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns is not None and len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

By adding the `if self.columns is not None and len(self.columns) > 0:` condition before accessing the length of `self.columns`, we ensure that the code handles the case when `columns` is `None`. This corrected version should pass the failing test and address the reported bug in the GitHub issue.
