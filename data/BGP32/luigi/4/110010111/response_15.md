### Analysis:
1. **Buggy Function:** The `copy` function inside the `S3CopyToTable` class in the `luigi/contrib/redshift.py` file is failing due to an issue with the input parameter `self.columns` being `None`.
   
2. **Error Location:** The error occurs at line 338 where `if len(self.columns) > 0:` is being checked.

3. **Cause of the Bug:**
   - **Buggy Function:** The `copy` function is trying to get the length of `self.columns` without checking if it is `None`.
   - **Error Message:** The TypeError indicates that an object of type 'NoneType' doesn't have a length.
   - **Expected Input/Output:** The `columns` attribute is set to `None`, but the function does not handle this case, causing the error.
   - **GitHub Issue:** The issue highlights that the code fails when `columns` are not provided explicitly and suggests a fix to check if `self.columns` exists before checking its length.

4. **Fixing Strategy:**
   - Modify the line that checks the length of `self.columns` to be more robust by first checking if `self.columns` exists before checking its length. This change will prevent the function from trying to get the length of `NoneType`.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:  # Check if self.columns exists before getting its length
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

By making this correction, the `copy` function will first verify the existence of `self.columns` before attempting to get its length, thus addressing the TypeError when `columns` are `None`.
