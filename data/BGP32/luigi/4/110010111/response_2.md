### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `copy` within the `S3CopyToTable` class is supposed to copy data from an S3 source into a Redshift table. The error message indicates that the function is encountering a `TypeError: object of type 'NoneType' has no len()` when checking the length of `self.columns`. This implies that `self.columns` is `None` instead of being a list.
2. The potential error location is identified in the line: `if len(self.columns) > 0:` where it is trying to determine the length of `self.columns`.
3. The cause of the bug is that when `columns` parameter is set to `None`, the function tries to check the length of `None`, leading to the mentioned error. This behavior contradicts the expectation mentioned in the GitHub issue which suggests a different condition check.
4. To fix this bug, the function should first check if `self.columns` is not `None` before attempting to determine its length.
5. I will provide a corrected version of the function based on the information gathered.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from S3 into Redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns is not None and len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
        COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
        CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
        {options}
        ;""".format(
            table=self.table,
            colnames=colnames,
            source=f,
            creds=self._credentials(),
            options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

By making the correction to check if `self.columns` is not `None` before checking its length, the function will avoid the `TypeError` and properly handle cases where `columns` is `None`. This correction aligns with the suggestion provided in the GitHub issue.
