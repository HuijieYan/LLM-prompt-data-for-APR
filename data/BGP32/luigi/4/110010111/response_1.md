## Analysis
The buggy function `copy` in the `S3CopyToTable` class is causing a `TypeError: object of type 'NoneType' has no len()` error when the `columns` attribute is `None`. The code attempts to check the length of `self.columns` without verifying if it is `None`. This error occurs while trying to execute a Redshift COPY command.

## Error Cause
The cause of the bug is that the code does not account for the case where `self.columns` is `None`. Since the `columns` attribute can be `None` according to the class documentation, trying to get the length of `None` results in a `TypeError`.

## Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to modify the conditional check for the length of `self.columns` to include a check for `None` before trying to get the length. By first checking if `self.columns` is not `None`, we can avoid the `TypeError`.

## Corrected Code
Here is the corrected version of the `copy` function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:  # Check if self.columns is not None before getting its length
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

By adding the check `if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0`, we ensure that the code only tries to get the length of `self.columns` if it is not `None`, thus fixing the bug and addressing the issue described on GitHub.
