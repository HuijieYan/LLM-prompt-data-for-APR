Based on the provided information, the bug in the `copy` function of the `S3CopyToTable` class is due to the condition `if len(self.columns) > 0:`. When the `columns` attribute is set to `None`, this condition will cause a `TypeError` as it tries to get the length of a `None` object.

To fix this bug, we should update the condition to check if `self.columns` is not `None` before checking its length.

Here is the corrected version of the `copy` function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns is not None:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

By checking if `self.columns is not None`, we ensure that the length check is only performed when `self.columns` is an actual list. This change will prevent the `TypeError` when `columns` is `None`.

This corrected version should address the bug and pass the failing test case mentioned.
