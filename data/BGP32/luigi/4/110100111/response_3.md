### Analysis:
1. The buggy function is within the `S3CopyToTable` class in the `redshift.py` file of the `luigi` library.
2. The `copy` function is supposed to define copying from S3 into Redshift.
3. The bug occurs when `self.columns` is `None`, causing an error when trying to check its length.
4. The fix involves checking if `self.columns` is not `None` before trying to get its length.

### Bug Explanation:
When `self.columns` is `None`, the buggy function tries to check the length of `None`, which raises a `TypeError`. This is problematic because the buggy code assumes that `self.columns` is always a list, without considering the case where it might be `None`. The error occurs specifically when trying to access the length of `self.columns` in `len(self.columns)`.

To fix this issue, we need to make sure that `self.columns` is not `None` before attempting to get its length.

### Bug Fix:
```python
# The corrected version of the buggy function
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:  # Check if self.columns is not None before getting its length
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

By adding a check for `self.columns` before attempting to get its length, we prevent the `TypeError` that was occurring when `self.columns` is `None`. This fix aligns with the suggested solution in the GitHub issue mentioned.
