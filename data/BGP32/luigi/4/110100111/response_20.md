### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `copy` within the `S3CopyToTable` class in the `redshift.py` file is intended to handle copying data from S3 into Redshift.
2. The bug arises when `self.columns` is `None` and the code tries to access its length causing a `TypeError`.
3. The failing test `test_s3_copy_with_nonetype_columns` passes a `DummyS3CopyToTableKey` object with `columns=None`. The expected behavior is for `colnames` to be an empty string when `self.columns` is `None`.
4. To fix the bug, we need to check if `self.columns` is not `None` before attempting to access its length.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is caused by the assumption that `self.columns` will always have a valid value before trying to access its length. When `self.columns` is `None`, an attempt to get its length results in a `TypeError`.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to modify the code to explicitly check if `self.columns` is not `None` before using it to construct the `colnames` string.

### Corrected Version of the buggy function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

By checking `if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0`, we ensure that we only attempt to access the length of `self.columns` when it is not `None`. This modification should resolve the `TypeError` caused by the bug.
