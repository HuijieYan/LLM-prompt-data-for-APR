## Analysis:
1. The buggy function `copy` in the `S3CopyToTable` class is attempting to build a SQL `COPY` statement to copy data from s3 to Redshift. The bug is related to checking the length of `self.columns` which is set to `None` causing an error when trying to get the length of `None`.
   
2. The bug seems to be occurring due to the assumption that `self.columns` will always have a value. When `columns` parameter is set to `None` in the test, it causes the bug because the length of `None` cannot be determined using `len()`.

3. In the failing test, when `columns` is set to `None` in the `DummyS3CopyToTableKey` instance, the `columns` parameter is passed as `None` to the `S3CopyToTable` object. The bug occurs in the `copy` function when it attempts to calculate the length of `self.columns`. The expected behavior should be to handle the case when `self.columns` is `None` gracefully without causing an error.

4. To fix the bug, a check needs to be added in the `copy` function to handle the case when `self.columns` is `None` before attempting to get its length. This will prevent the `TypeError` that occurs when trying to get the length of `None`.

## Corrected Version:
```python
    def copy(self, cursor, f):
        """
        Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

        If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
        """
        logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
        colnames = ''
        if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:  # Fix added here
            colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
            colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

        cursor.execute("""
         COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
         CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
         {options}
         ;""".format(
            table=self.table,
            colnames=colnames,
            source=f,
            creds=self._credentials(),
            options=self.copy_options)
        )
```

By adding a check `if self.columns`, we ensure that only when `self.columns` is not `None`, the code proceeds to calculate the length of `self.columns`. This modification should resolve the bug and allow the function to handle the case when `columns` is set to `None` properly.
