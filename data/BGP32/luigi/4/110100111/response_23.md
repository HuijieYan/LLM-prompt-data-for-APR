## Analysis:
1. The buggy function `copy` within the `S3CopyToTable` class in the `luigi.contrib.redshift.py` file is failing due to a condition check on the `self.columns` attribute.
2. The bug occurs when `self.columns` is `None`, leading to a `TypeError: object of type 'NoneType' has no len()`.
3. The failing test `test_s3_copy_with_nonetype_columns` mocks the required objects and expects the `COPY` statement to have an empty `colnames` when `self.columns` is `None`.
4. To fix the bug, we need to update the condition check on `self.columns` to handle the case where it might be `None`.

## Bug Cause:
The bug is caused by the following line of code within the `copy` function:
```python
if len(self.columns) > 0:
```
When `self.columns` is `None`, attempting to call `len()` on it results in a `TypeError`.

## Fix Strategy:
- Modify the condition check to first verify if `self.columns` is not `None` before checking its length.

## Corrected Version:
```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns is not None and len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute(f"""
     COPY {self.table} {colnames} from '{f}'
     CREDENTIALS '{self._credentials()}'
     {self.copy_options}
     ;
    """)
```

By updating the condition check on `self.columns` to first verify if it's not `None`, we can prevent the `TypeError` from occurring. The corrected version ensures that the `colnames` are constructed correctly even when `self.columns` is `None`.
