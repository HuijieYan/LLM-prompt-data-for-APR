### Analysis:
1. The provided buggy function `copy` in the `S3CopyToTable` class is intended to execute a Redshift COPY command.
2. The issue arises when trying to construct the `colnames` variable when `self.columns` is `None`.
3. The failing test `test_s3_copy_with_nonetype_columns` aims to test the behavior of the function when `self.columns` is `None`.
4. Based on the GitHub issue, the bug occurs due to the attempt to use `len(self.columns) > 0` directly without checking if `self.columns` is not `None`.
   
### Bug Cause:
The bug occurs because when `self.columns` is `None`, it cannot be directly used in the `if len(self.columns) > 0` check, resulting in a `TypeError`.

### Suggested Fix:
To fix the bug, we need to check if `self.columns` is not `None` before trying to get its length. By adding an extra check for `if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0`, we can ensure the code handles the case where `self.columns` is `None`.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:  # Check if self.columns is not None
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

By making this change, the function will handle the case where `self.columns` is `None`, which aligns with the suggested solution in the GitHub issue.
