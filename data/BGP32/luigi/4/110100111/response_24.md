### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `copy(self, cursor, f)` is within the `S3CopyToTable` class in the `luigi/contrib/redshift.py` file. It is responsible for copying data from S3 into Redshift.
2. The bug seems to occur when `self.columns` is `None`, causing an error when trying to get the length of `self.columns`.
3. The failing test case `test_s3_copy_with_nonetype_columns` expects an empty string for `colnames` when `columns` is `None`.
4. To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the logic for checking the length of `self.columns` only executes if `self.columns` is not `None`.

### Bug Cause:
The bug occurs because the code checks the length of `self.columns` without verifying if `self.columns` is `None`. This leads to a `TypeError: object of type 'NoneType' has no len()` error.

### Proposed Fix:
Modify the line checking the length of `self.columns` by adding a check for `None` before checking the length.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:  # Add a check for None before checking length
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

By incorporating the check for `self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0`, we ensure that the code doesn't attempt to get the length of `None`, thus resolving the bug identified in the failing test case and the GitHub issue.
