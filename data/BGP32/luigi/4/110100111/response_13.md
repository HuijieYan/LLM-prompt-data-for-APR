## Analysis:
1. The buggy function `copy` is part of the `S3CopyToTable` class in `luigi/contrib/redshift.py`.
2. The function is supposed to copy data from s3 into Redshift based on the specified parameters.
3. The error occurs due to the assumption that `self.columns` is always provided and not `None`.
4. The failing test is checking the behavior when `columns=None`, and it expects an empty `colnames` string.

## Bug Explanation:
The bug is caused by assuming that `self.columns` will always have a value and calculating `colnames` based on it without checking for `None`. When `columns=None`, the code tries to apply `len(None)`, leading to the `TypeError: object of type 'NoneType' has no len()` error.

## Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix this bug, we need to check if `self.columns` is not `None` before processing it to prevent the `TypeError`. We can update the condition to `if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:` to handle cases where `self.columns` is `None`.

## Code Fix:
```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:  # Check if self.columns is not None before further processing
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

By adding the check `if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:`, we ensure that `colnames` is calculated only when `self.columns` is not `None`, resolving the issue described in the GitHub bug report.
