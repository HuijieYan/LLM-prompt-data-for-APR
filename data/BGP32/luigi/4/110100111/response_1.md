### Analysis:
1. The buggy function is within the `S3CopyToTable` class in the `luigi/contrib/redshift.py` file.
2. The function `copy` is expected to execute a Redshift COPY command, reading from a specific S3 location and inserting into a Redshift table.
3. The bug arises when `self.columns` is `None`, leading to a `TypeError` due to trying to get the length of a `NoneType` object.
4. The `copy` function does not handle the case where `self.columns` is `None`, causing the error. The fix involves checking if `self.columns` is not `None` before attempting to get its length.

### Bug Explanation:
When `self.columns` is `None`, the buggy function tries to get the length of `None`, leading to a `TypeError`. This issue was identified and reported in a GitHub issue, suggesting a fix by checking if `self.columns` is not `None` before proceeding with the length check.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
Modify the `copy` function to check if `self.columns` is not `None` before trying to get its length. This will prevent the `TypeError` when `self.columns` is `None`.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.
    
    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

By adding the conditional check `if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:`, we ensure that the length of `self.columns` is only obtained when it is not `None`, addressing the bug and aligning with the suggested fix on GitHub.
