## Analysis:
1. The buggy function `copy` within the class `S3CopyToTable` in the file `luigi/contrib/redshift.py` of Luigi's codebase is failing to handle the case where `self.columns` is set to `None`, resulting in a TypeError due to calling `len` on a `NoneType`.
2. The buggy function attempts to construct a `colnames` string by joining the column names using a comma, but does not check if `self.columns` is `None` before attempting this operation.
3. The failing test `test_s3_copy_with_nonetype_columns` expects the `colnames` variable to be an empty string when `self.columns` is `None`. This mismatches with the current behavior of the buggy function.
4. To fix the bug, we need to add a check in the `copy` function to handle the case where `self.columns` is `None`, ensuring that the `colnames` string construction is skipped in that scenario.

## Bug Fix:
```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
        """
        Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

        If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
        """
        logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
        colnames = ''
        if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:  # Check if self.columns is not None before processing
            colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
            colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

        cursor.execute("""
         COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
         CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
         {options}
         ;""".format(
            table=self.table,
            colnames=colnames,
            source=f,
            creds=self._credentials(),
            options=self.copy_options)
        )
```

By adding the check `if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0`, we ensure that the `colnames` string is only constructed when `self.columns` is not `None`. This modification addresses the bug and aligns the behavior of the `copy` function with the expectations of the failing test case.

With this fix, the `copy` function should now handle the case where `self.columns` is `None` without raising a TypeError. This correction should resolve the issue reported on GitHub related to Redshift COPY failures when columns are not provided.
