### Analysis
The buggy function `copy` in the `S3CopyToTable` class is causing a `TypeError` when `self.columns` is `None`. The function tries to calculate the length of `self.columns` without checking if it is `None` first, leading to the error.

### Bug Cause
The bug is caused by the assumption that `self.columns` always has a value, leading to an attempt to calculate its length even when it is `None`.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug
To fix the bug, we need to check if `self.columns` is not `None` before calculating its length.

### Corrected Version of the Function

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns is not None and len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

By adding the check `if self.columns is not None and len(self.columns) > 0`, we ensure that the length of `self.columns` is only calculated when it is not `None`, fixing the bug that caused the `TypeError` when `self.columns` is `None`.
