### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `copy` in the `S3CopyToTable` class is responsible for copying data from S3 to Redshift.
2. The bug seems to occur when `self.columns` is `None`, leading to a `TypeError`.
3. The failing test case `test_s3_copy_with_nonetype_columns` sets `columns=None`, triggering the bug.
4. The GitHub issue points out the root cause being the reliance on `len` directly on `self.columns`.
5. The suggested fix from the GitHub issue proposes adding an additional check for `self.columns` before checking its length.

### Bug Cause:
The bug occurs because the `copy` function assumes `self.columns` will always be a list, leading to an error when it is `None`. The code should handle this case to prevent the `TypeError`.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that `self.columns` is not `None` before attempting to check its length in the `copy` function.

### Corrected Function:
```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:  # Add a check for self.columns
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

By adding a check for `self.columns` before checking its length, the corrected function will prevent the `TypeError` when `self.columns` is `None`. This fix aligns with the suggestion provided in the GitHub issue to address the root cause of the bug.
