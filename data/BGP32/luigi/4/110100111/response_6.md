### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `copy()` in the `S3CopyToTable` class is responsible for copying data from an S3 bucket to a Redshift table. The bug relates to handling the `columns` attribute when it is set to `None`.
2. The bug occurs when `self.columns` is `None` and the code tries to calculate the length of a `NoneType` object, leading to a `TypeError`.
3. The failing test `test_s3_copy_with_nonetype_columns` creates an instance of `DummyS3CopyToTableKey` with `columns=None` and expects the `colnames` variable to be an empty string in the SQL query executed by the `copy()` function.
4. To fix the bug, we need to check if `self.columns` is not `None` before trying to get its length.
5. Let's provide a corrected version of the `copy()` function to address this issue.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

By adding the condition `if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0`, we ensure that the `colnames` variable is populated only when `self.columns` is not `None`. This correction addresses the issue described in the GitHub bug report and ensures that the function works correctly with `columns=None`.
