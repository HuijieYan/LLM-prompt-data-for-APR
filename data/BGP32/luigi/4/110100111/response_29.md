The bug in the `copy` function is caused by directly accessing the `self.columns` attribute without checking if it is `None` or not. This causes a `TypeError` when trying to calculate the length of `None`. To fix this bug, we need to add a check to ensure that `self.columns` is not `None` before trying to access its length.

Here is the corrected version of the `copy` function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

By adding the check `if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0`, we ensure that `self.columns` is not `None` before attempting to calculate its length. This fix will address the `TypeError` that occurs when `self.columns` is `None`.

This corrected version should now pass the failing test and avoid the issue reported on GitHub related to the `Redshift COPY` operation failing when `columns` are not provided.
