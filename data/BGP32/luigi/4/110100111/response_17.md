### Analysis:
- **Buggy Function**: The `copy` function within the `S3CopyToTable` class in `luigi/contrib/redshift.py` is the buggy function that needs fixing.
- **Buggy Class**: The `S3CopyToTable` class contains the `copy` function, and it is a template task for inserting a data set into Redshift from S3.
- **Test Code**: The failing test is in `test/contrib/redshift_test.py`, specifically the `test_s3_copy_with_nonetype_columns` test case.
- **Expected Input/Output Values**: The `copy` function fails when `self.columns` is `None`, causing a `TypeError` due to calling `len` on a `NoneType`.
- **GitHub Issue**: The GitHub issue titled "Redshift COPY fails in luigi 2.7.1 when columns are not provided" addresses the bug and suggests a solution.

### Identified Error Location:
The issue lies in the `copy` function where the length of `self.columns` is directly accessed without checking if it is `None`.

### Cause of the Bug:
- The bug occurs when the `self.columns` attribute is `None`, leading to a `TypeError` when trying to determine its length.
- The failing test sends a task with `columns=None`, triggering the bug in the `copy` function.
- The GitHub issue suggests that explicitly checking `if self.columns` before using `len(self.columns)` would prevent the error.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
- Modify the `copy` function to check if `self.columns` is not `None` before getting its length.
- Update the function to handle the case when `self.columns` is `None` differently to avoid the `TypeError`.

### Corrected Version of the Buggy Function:
```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from S3 into Redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:  # Check if self.columns is not None before getting length
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

By adding the check `if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0` before accessing the length, the function will handle the case when `self.columns` is `None` and prevent the `TypeError`. This corrected version should address the bug and pass the failing test case.
