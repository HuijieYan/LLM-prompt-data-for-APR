## Analysis
1. The `copy` function in the `S3CopyToTable` class is designed to copy data from S3 to Redshift.
2. The bug occurs when the `columns` attribute is set to `None`, leading to an error because the buggy implementation does not handle this case.
3. The failing test `test_s3_copy_with_nonetype_columns` aims to verify that the `COPY` SQL statement is properly formatted when `columns` is `None`.
4. The bug originates from the assumption that `self.columns` is not `None`, leading to a `TypeError` when trying to determine the length of `None`.
5. To fix the bug, we need to check if `self.columns` is not `None` before trying to extract column names.
6. The correct behavior should return an empty string for `colnames` when `self.columns` is `None`.

## Bug Fix Strategy
1. Add a check to ensure `self.columns` is not `None` before attempting to extract column names for `colnames`.
2. If `self.columns` is not `None`, proceed with extracting and formatting column names. Otherwise, set `colnames` to an empty string.
3. By handling the `None` case correctly, the function should be able to handle scenarios where no columns are provided.
4. Test the corrected version of the function to ensure it passes the failing test.

## Corrected Function
```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns is not None and len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

After applying this fix, the `copy` function should handle the case where `self.columns` is `None` and pass the failing test mentioned in the GitHub issue.
