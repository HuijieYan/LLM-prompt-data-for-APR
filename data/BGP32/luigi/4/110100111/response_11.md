## Analysis:
1. The buggy function `copy` in the `S3CopyToTable` class is responsible for executing the `COPY` command in Redshift from an s3 source.
2. The bug arises when `self.columns` is `None`, causing the code to attempt to get the length of `None`.
3. The failing test `test_s3_copy_with_nonetype_columns` expects an empty column list to be handled correctly in the `COPY` statement.
4. The GitHub issue explains the root cause and suggests changing the condition to `if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0` to prevent the `TypeError`.

## Bug Cause:
The bug is caused by the assumption that `self.columns` will always have a value, leading to a `TypeError` when it is `None`.

## Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to check if `self.columns` is not `None` before attempting to get its length in the `copy` function.

## Corrected Version:
```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

With this updated condition, the function will only attempt to create `colnames` if `self.columns` is not `None`. This will handle the case when `columns` is `None`, as expected by the failing test.
