### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `copy` within the `S3CopyToTable` class is responsible for executing a `COPY` command from S3 to Redshift. The bug arises when `self.columns` is None, leading to a `TypeError` due to trying to get the length of a None type object.
2. The buggy function fails to check if `self.columns` is None before trying to access its length.
3. The failing test `test_s3_copy_with_nonetype_columns` aims to create a task without columns, run it, and check if the expected `COPY` command is executed properly. However, due to the bug, the test fails with a `TypeError`.
4. To fix the bug, we need to check if `self.columns` is not None before attempting to access its length.
5. Here is the corrected version of the `copy` function:

### Corrected Version:
```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns is not None and len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

By checking if `self.columns` is not None before accessing its length, the bug causing the `TypeError` is fixed. This corrected version should now pass the failing test and address the GitHub issue related to Redshift COPY failures when columns are not provided.
