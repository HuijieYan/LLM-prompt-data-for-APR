## Analysis:
1. The buggy function `copy` within the `S3CopyToTable` class in `redshift.py` is failing to handle cases where `self.columns` is `None`, leading to a `TypeError`.
2. The issue seems to stem from the `if len(self.columns) > 0:` check without considering the case where `self.columns` is `None`.
3. The failing test case `test_s3_copy_with_nonetype_columns` creates an instance of `DummyS3CopyToTableKey` with `columns=None` and expects an empty string `''` for `colnames`.
4. The GitHub issue suggests a potential fix by modifying the condition to `if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:`, which will handle both cases of `None` and non-empty `self.columns`.

## Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Update the `if` condition in the `copy` function to check for `self.columns` before checking its length.
2. Handle the case where `self.columns` is `None` separately to avoid the `TypeError`.
3. Update the condition according to the suggestion from the GitHub issue.

## Corrected Version:
```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns is not None and len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

By updating the conditional check in the `copy` function, we can handle cases where `self.columns` is `None` gracefully without raising a `TypeError`. This correction aligns with the suggested solution from the GitHub issue.
