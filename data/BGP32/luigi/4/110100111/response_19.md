## Analysis:
1. The buggy function `copy` within the `S3CopyToTable` class in `redshift.py` is failing when `self.columns` is `None`. This causes an error due to trying to get the length of `None`.
2. The failing test `test_s3_copy_with_nonetype_columns` sets `columns` to `None` while creating an instance of `DummyS3CopyToTableKey`.
3. The buggy function `copy` constructs a SQL query for copying data from S3 to Redshift, but it assumes `self.columns` is always a list, leading to the issue when it is `None`.
4. To fix the bug, we should check if `self.columns` is not `None` before trying to access its length.
5. Update the `copy` function to include a check for `self.columns` to prevent the error when it is `None`.

## Bug Fix:
```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns is not None and len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

By adding the check `if self.columns is not None` before accessing `len(self.columns)`, we ensure that the code will handle cases where `self.columns` is `None` without causing errors. This fix addresses the bug reported on GitHub.
