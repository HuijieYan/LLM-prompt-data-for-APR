Potential errors in the buggy function:
1. The `copy_options` method is not being called correctly in the `cursor.execute` statement.
2. The `options=self.copy_options` should be `options=self.copy_options()` to actually call the method and retrieve the options.

Cause of the bug:
The bug arises from not calling the `copy_options` method correctly within the `cursor.execute` statement. Instead of calling the method by adding parentheses `()`, it is being passed as a function object.

Strategy for fixing the bug:
To fix the bug, we need to call the `copy_options` method by adding parentheses `()` after it in the `cursor.execute` statement to actually retrieve the options.

Corrected version of the buggy function:
```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options())
    )
```
