## Analysis:
1. The buggy function `copy` is a method of the `S3CopyToTable` class.
2. The `copy` function is responsible for copying data from S3 into Redshift.
3. The bug seems to be in the way the `copy_options` method is being called within the `cursor.execute` statement.

## Identifying Potential Error:
The bug lies in the `cursor.execute` call within the `copy` function, specifically in the `options=self.copy_options` parameter. The `copy_options` method should be called like a function `self.copy_options()` rather than just being referenced as `self.copy_options`.

## Cause of the Bug:
The bug is caused because `self.copy_options` is being referenced without being called as a function. This results in passing a reference to the `copy_options` method rather than its returned value, leading to unexpected behavior.

## Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to call the `copy_options` method as a function by adding parentheses at the end, like `self.copy_options()`, so that the returned value of `copy_options` is passed as the `options` parameter in the `cursor.execute` statement.

## Corrected Version:
```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options())
    )
```

In the corrected version, `self.copy_options()` is called as a function to obtain the options provided by the `copy_options` method for the `COPY` command in Redshift.
