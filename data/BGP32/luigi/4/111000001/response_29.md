## Analysis:
1. The buggy function `copy` in the `S3CopyToTable` class is responsible for copying data from an S3 source to a Redshift table.
2. The bug seems to be in the `cursor.execute` statement where the `copy_options` function is not being called correctly and is missing the parentheses.
3. The `cursor.execute` statement is not correctly calling the `copy_options` function in the string interpolation, causing a syntax error.
4. To fix the bug, we need to explicitly call the `copy_options` function and include the parentheses in the string interpolation.
5. The corrected version of the function is provided below:

## Corrected Version:

```python
    def copy(self, cursor, f):
        """
        Defines copying from s3 into redshift.
    
        If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
        """
        logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
        colnames = ''
        if len(self.columns) > 0:
            colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
            colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)
    
        cursor.execute("""
         COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
         CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
         {options}
         ;""".format(
            table=self.table,
            colnames=colnames,
            source=f,
            creds=self._credentials(),
            options=self.copy_options())
        )
```
