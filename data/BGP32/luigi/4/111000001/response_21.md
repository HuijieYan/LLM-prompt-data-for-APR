### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `copy` in the `S3CopyToTable` class is responsible for inserting data from S3 into Redshift.
2. The function constructs a SQL query using string formatting to execute the `COPY` command in Redshift.
3. The potential error lies in the construction of the SQL query as there seems to be an issue with how `copy_options` function is being used in the `cursor.execute` call.
4. The bug seems to arise from missing parentheses when calling the `copy_options` function and not actually executing it. This results in `options=self.copy_options` just passing the function reference instead of getting the actual options string.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the `copy_options` function is properly evaluated and its return value is used in the `COPY` SQL query. This can be done by calling `copy_options` as a function to get the actual options string.

### Corrected Version:
```python
    def copy(self, cursor, f):
        """
        Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

        If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
        """
        logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
        colnames = ''
        if len(self.columns) > 0:
            colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
            colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

        cursor.execute("""
         COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
         CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
         {options}
         ;""".format(
            table=self.table,
            colnames=colnames,
            source=f,
            creds=self._credentials(),
            options=self.copy_options())
        )
``` 

By calling `self.copy_options()` instead of `self.copy_options`, we ensure that the function is executed, and its return value is used in the SQL query as intended.
