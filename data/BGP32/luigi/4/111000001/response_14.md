## Analysis
1. The buggy function `copy` in the `S3CopyToTable` class is responsible for defining the copying operation from S3 into Redshift.
2. The `copy_options` function is related as it is called within the `copy` function to set copy options.
3. The bug in the code is in the `cursor.execute` call where the `copy_options` function is not being called correctly.
4. The bug can be fixed by actually calling the `copy_options` function to retrieve the copy options.
5. See the corrected version below.

## Corrected Version
```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options())
    )
```

In the corrected version, the `copy_options` function is called correctly with parentheses to actually execute it and retrieve the copy options. This change ensures that the copy operation will include the correct options when executing the SQL query.
