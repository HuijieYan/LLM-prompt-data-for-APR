Potential error locations within the buggy function:
1. The `self.copy_options` is being used as a function object rather than calling the function.

Cause of the bug:
The bug in the `copy` function lies in how `self.copy_options` is being used. It is called as a function but should be called to retrieve the options string for the `COPY` command.

Strategy for fixing the bug:
To fix the bug, we need to call the `copy_options` function to retrieve the options string and concatenate it properly in the `cursor.execute` statement.

Corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options())
    )
```

By calling `self.copy_options()` instead of just `self.copy_options`, we ensure that the function is executed to retrieve the options string needed for the `COPY` command.
