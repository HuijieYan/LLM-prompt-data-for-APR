## Analysis:
1. The buggy function `copy` is within the `S3CopyToTable` class, which is a subclass of `rdbms.CopyToTable` and `_CredentialsMixin`.
2. The `copy` function is responsible for copying data from S3 into Redshift.
3. The bug likely lies in the way the `cursor.execute` statement is constructed, specifically with the `options` parameter.
4. The `copy_options` function is provided in the class, but it is not being called correctly in the `cursor.execute` statement.

## Bug Cause:
The bug in the `copy` function is caused by not calling the `copy_options` function correctly within the `cursor.execute` statement. Instead of calling the function `self.copy_options()`, the buggy code attempts to use `self.copy_options` directly, which does not execute the function. As a result, the `options` parameter in the SQL query does not contain the actual copy options.

## Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to call the `self.copy_options()` function and provide the actual options to the `cursor.execute` statement. This way, the SQL query will have the correct options for copying data from S3 into Redshift.

## Corrected Version:
```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options())
    )
```

In the corrected version, `self.copy_options()` is called to execute the function and provide the actual options for copying data. This will ensure that the SQL query is constructed correctly with the copy options included.
