## Analysis:
1. The buggy function `copy` is a part of the `S3CopyToTable` class in the `luigi/contrib/redshift.py` file.
2. The function is responsible for copying data from Amazon S3 into Redshift.
3. Potential error locations:
    - The use of `{options}` in the `cursor.execute` method without calling the `copy_options` function.
4. Cause of the bug:
    - The bug is caused by not actually invoking the `copy_options` function to get the copy options before passing it to the `cursor.execute` method.
5. Strategy for fixing the bug:
    - Call the `copy_options` function to get the copy options before constructing the query string for `cursor.execute`.
    - Ensure that the correct options are passed to the `cursor.execute` method.

## Corrected Version:
```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    options = self.copy_options()  # Call the copy_options function to get the options
    
    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=options)  # Pass the options obtained from `copy_options` function
    )
```

In the corrected version, the `copy_options` function is called to get the copy options before constructing the query string for `cursor.execute`. This fixes the bug by ensuring that the correct options are passed to the `cursor.execute` method.
