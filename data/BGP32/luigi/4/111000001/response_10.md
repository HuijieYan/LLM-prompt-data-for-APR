### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `copy` in the class `S3CopyToTable` is responsible for copying data from S3 into Redshift.
2. The `copy_options` function is called within the `copy` function to retrieve copy options, but there seems to be an issue with how it is being called.
3. The bug in the `copy` function is most likely related to the way `copy_options` is accessed. The current implementation tries to call `self.copy_options` directly without actually invoking the function.
4. To fix the bug, we need to call the `copy_options` function to get the copy options string before concatenating it into the SQL query.

### Bug Fix:
Here is the corrected version of the `copy` function with the bug fixed:

```python
    def copy(self, cursor, f):
        """
        Defines copying from s3 into redshift.
    
        If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
        """
        logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
        colnames = ''
        if len(self.columns) > 0:
            colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
            colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)
        
        copy_options = self.copy_options()  # Call the function to get copy options
        
        cursor.execute("""
         COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
         CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
         {options}
         ;""".format(
            table=self.table,
            colnames=colnames,
            source=f,
            creds=self._credentials(),
            options=copy_options)  # Use the obtained copy options
        )
```

In the corrected version, `copy_options` is assigned the result of calling `self.copy_options()` before being used in the SQL query. This ensures that we retrieve the actual copy options string before composing the `COPY` command.
