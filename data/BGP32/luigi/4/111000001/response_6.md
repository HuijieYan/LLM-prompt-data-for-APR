### Analysis:
- The `S3CopyToTable` class contains a buggy function `copy`.
- The `copy` function is responsible for copying data from S3 into Redshift.
- The bug is in the way the `copy` function uses the `copy_options` method.

### Bug Location:
- The bug is in the line where `self.copy_options` is used within the `cursor.execute` statement.
- `self.copy_options` should be a method call (`self.copy_options()`), but it's being accessed as a property without invoking it.

### Cause of the Bug:
- The bug is caused by not invoking the `copy_options` method. By using `self.copy_options` without parentheses, the method is not called, and the options are not retrieved correctly.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
- To fix the bug, we need to call the `copy_options` method by adding parentheses when accessing it in the `cursor.execute` statement.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options())
    )
``` 

### Correction Made:
- Changed `self.copy_options` to `self.copy_options()`, so now the `copy_options` method is correctly called to retrieve the options for the copy operation.
