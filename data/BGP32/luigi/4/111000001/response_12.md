## Analysis:

1. The `copy` function in the `S3CopyToTable` class is responsible for copying data from S3 into Redshift.
2. The bug seems to be in the way `copy_options` function is being called within the `cursor.execute` statement.
3. The bug is likely caused by not calling `copy_options` function correctly within the `cursor.execute` statement, which may result in missing or improper copy options.
4. To fix the bug, we need to ensure that `copy_options` function is called correctly to provide the necessary copy options during the data copy operation.

## Bug fix:

Here is the corrected version of the `copy` function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options())
    )
```

In the fixed version, `copy_options` function is called correctly as `self.copy_options()` within the `cursor.execute` statement to ensure that the copy options are properly included in the data copy operation.
