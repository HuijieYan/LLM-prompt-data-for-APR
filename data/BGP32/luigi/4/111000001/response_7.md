## Analysis:
The buggy function `copy` in the `S3CopyToTable` class is attempting to execute a `COPY` command in Redshift to copy data from an S3 source. The function is trying to construct the query dynamically using formatting strings. The bug seems to be in the way the `copy_options` function is called within the `cursor.execute` statement.

## Potential Error Locations:
1. The use of `self.copy_options` without calling it as a function when constructing the query statement.
2. The way variables `table`, `colnames`, `source`, `creds`, and `options` are being used in the format string.

## Cause of Bug:
The bug is caused by not calling the `copy_options` function correctly and not constructing the query statement properly. The `copy_options` function should be called as a method instead of referencing it directly, and the variables in the format string should be properly formatted.

## Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
1. Call the `copy_options` function when constructing the query.
2. Ensure variables `table`, `colnames`, `source`, `creds`, and `options` are used properly in the format string.

## Corrected Version:
```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options())
    )
```

In the corrected version:
1. `self.copy_options()` is called as a method.
2. Variables like `table`, `colnames`, `source`, `creds`, and `options` are used properly in the format string.
