The bug in the provided function is in the way the `copy_options` method is being called in the `cursor.execute` statement. The `copy_options` method is a separate method defined in the same class `S3CopyToTable`, but it is not being called correctly in the `cursor.execute` statement.

To fix the bug, we need to call the `copy_options` method by adding `()` at the end, as it is a method that needs to be invoked to get its return value. Currently, it is being treated as a reference to the method itself, which is causing the issue.

Here is the corrected version of the `copy` function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options())
    )
```

In this corrected version, the `copy_options` method is correctly called with `()` at the end in the `cursor.execute` statement.

By applying this fix, the `copy` function should now work correctly without any bugs related to calling the `copy_options` method.
