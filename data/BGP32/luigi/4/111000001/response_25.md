### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `copy` in the `S3CopyToTable` class is responsible for copying data from s3 into Redshift.
2. The function uses string formatting to construct an SQL query for the `COPY` command.
3. The bug seems to be related to the `copy_options` function, as it is not being called correctly within the `copy` function.
4. The incorrect usage of `copy_options` in the `copy` function is likely the cause of the bug.

### Bug Cause:
The bug in the `copy` function arises from not calling the `copy_options` function correctly. This results in the `options` parameter in the SQL query being assigned the function object itself, instead of the result of calling the function.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the `copy_options` function is correctly called within the `copy` function to obtain the actual options for the `COPY` command.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options())
    )
```

In the corrected version, `self.copy_options()` is called to obtain the actual options for the `COPY` command. This will fix the bug and ensure that the `options` parameter in the SQL query contains the correct options for copying data from s3 into Redshift.
