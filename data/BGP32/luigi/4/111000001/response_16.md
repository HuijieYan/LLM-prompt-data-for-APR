Potential errors in the buggy function:
1. The `copy_options` function is not being called correctly in the `cursor.execute` statement. It should be `self.copy_options()` instead of `self.copy_options`.

Cause of the bug:
The buggy function is not correctly calling the `copy_options` function when constructing the `cursor.execute` statement. This can lead to incorrect behavior or errors in the execution of the SQL query.

Strategy for fixing the bug:
Modify the `self.copy_options` call to `self.copy_options()` to ensure that the `copy_options` function is properly executed and its result is included in the SQL query.

Corrected version of the function:
```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options())
    )
``` 

By making this change, the `copy_options` function will be called correctly, providing the necessary options for the `COPY` command, and fixing the bug in the function.
