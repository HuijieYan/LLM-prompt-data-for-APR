The bug in the provided function `copy` lies in the way the `copy_options` function is being called. In the original buggy code, `self.copy_options` is not being called as a function, but rather as a reference to the function object itself.

To fix the bug:
1. You need to call the `copy_options` function as `self.copy_options()` to actually execute the function and get the desired copy options.
2. Additionally, the `cursor` object passed as an argument to the `copy` function needs to be used to execute the SQL query.

Here is the corrected version of the function with the bug fixed:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options())
    )
```

In the corrected version, the `self.copy_options()` is called as a function and the `cursor` object is used to execute the SQL query.
