## Analysis:
The buggy function `copy` in the `S3CopyToTable` class is responsible for copying data from S3 to Redshift. The function constructs a SQL query to execute the `COPY` command on the database using the provided parameters. However, there are multiple issues in the implementation:

1. The `colnames` variable is not being properly formatted with parentheses when there are columns to copy.
2. The `options` attribute is being referenced incorrectly without calling the `copy_options` method.

## Bug Cause:
The bug arises from incorrect referencing of the `copy_options` method and incorrect formatting of the `colnames` variable. The `options` attribute is treated as a method without being called, leading to a potential error in executing the `COPY` command.

## Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to call the `copy_options` method to retrieve the correct copy options and format the `colnames` variable properly with parentheses when there are columns to copy.

## Corrected Version:
```python
class S3CopyToTable(rdbms.CopyToTable, _CredentialsMixin):
    """
    Template task for inserting a data set into Redshift from s3.
    
    Usage:
    
    * Subclass and override the required attributes:
    
      * `host`,
      * `database`,
      * `user`,
      * `password`,
      * `table`,
      * `columns`,
      * `s3_load_path`.
    
    * You can also override the attributes provided by the
      CredentialsMixin if they are not supplied by your
      configuration or environment variables.
    """

    def copy_options(self):
        # Please ignore the body of this function
    
    def copy(self, cursor, f):
        """
        Defines copying from s3 into redshift.
    
        If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
        """
        logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
        colnames = ''
        if self.columns:
            colnames = '({})'.format(",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns]))
    
        cursor.execute("""
         COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
         CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
         {options}
         ;""".format(
            table=self.table,
            colnames=colnames,
            source=f,
            creds=self._credentials(),
            options=self.copy_options())
        )
```

In the corrected version, `copy_options` is called as a method to retrieve the copy options, and the `colnames` variable is formatted correctly with parentheses when there are columns to copy.
