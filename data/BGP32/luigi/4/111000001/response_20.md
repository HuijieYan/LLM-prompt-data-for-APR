### Analysis:
The buggy function `copy` within the `S3CopyToTable` class is responsible for copying data from s3 into Redshift. The function constructs and executes a SQL `COPY` command using parameters such as table name, column names, source path, credentials, and optional copy options.

### Potential Error Locations:
1. The `copy_options` function is being referenced incorrectly in the `cursor.execute` statement.
2. The `options=self.copy_options` line is missing a function call, resulting in passing the function object instead of its result.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is caused by not calling the `copy_options` function to retrieve the required copy options before constructing the `COPY` command. As a result, the function object itself is being passed as a parameter, leading to a syntax error.

### Fix Strategy:
1. Modify the `copy_options` function to return the copy options as a string.
2. Call the `copy_options` function to retrieve the copy options before constructing the SQL command.
3. Use the returned value of the `copy_options` function in the `cursor.execute` statement.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into Redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    options = self.copy_options()  # Call the copy_options function to get the copy options

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=options  # Use the retrieved copy options here
    )
)
```

By applying the corrections mentioned above, the bug in the `copy` function is fixed, and it should now properly construct and execute the `COPY` command in Redshift.
