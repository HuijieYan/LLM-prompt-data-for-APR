## Analysis:
- The `copy` function in the `S3CopyToTable` class is responsible for copying data from S3 into Redshift.
- The function constructs and executes a SQL query using attributes of the class.
- The `cursor.execute` method is used to execute the SQL query.

## Error Location:
- The `options=self.copy_options` at the end of the `cursor.execute` call seems to be a potential error.
- This should be a function call `self.copy_options()` rather than just referencing the function.

## Cause of the Bug:
- The bug is caused by passing the `copy_options` function as a parameter `options` in the `cursor.execute` call without actually calling the function.
- This results in `options` being assigned the function object instead of the actual options that the function should provide.

## Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
- Change `options=self.copy_options` to `options=self.copy_options()` in the `cursor.execute` call to ensure that the function is called and the actual options are provided.

## Corrected Version:
```python
    def copy(self, cursor, f):
        """
        Defines copying from s3 into redshift.
    
        If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
        """
        logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
        colnames = ''
        if len(self.columns) > 0:
            colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
            colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)
    
        cursor.execute("""
         COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
         CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
         {options}
         ;""".format(
            table=self.table,
            colnames=colnames,
            source=f,
            creds=self._credentials(),
            options=self.copy_options())
        )
```
