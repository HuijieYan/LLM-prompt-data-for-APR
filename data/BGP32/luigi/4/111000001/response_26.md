The buggy function `copy` in the `S3CopyToTable` class has a bug where the `copy_options` variable is not being called as a function. The `copy_options` function is defined in the same class but is not being executed. This results in `options=self.copy_options` assigning the function object to the `options` variable rather than the result of calling the function.

To fix this bug, we need to call the `copy_options` function in the `cursor.execute` method by adding `()` at the end of `self.copy_options`. This will ensure that the return value of the `copy_options` function is used as the value for the `options` parameter.

Here is the corrected version of the `copy` function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options())
    )
```

By adding `()` to `self.copy_options`, we ensure that the `copy_options` function is executed and its result is used as the value for the `options` parameter in the `cursor.execute` method.
