## Analysis:
- The buggy function `copy` is supposed to copy data from an S3 source into a Redshift table. It constructs a `COPY` command SQL statement based on the attributes of the class.
- The bug seems to be in the way `copy_options` is being used within the `cursor.execute` statement.
- The `copy` function uses `copy_options` as a method but it needs to be called as a function to retrieve its return value.

## Cause of the Bug:
- The bug is caused by not calling the `copy_options` method correctly. 
- In the `cursor.execute` statement, `self.copy_options` should be `self.copy_options()` to actually execute the function and get its return value.

## Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
- Modify the line in `cursor.execute` where `self.copy_options` is used to call the method correctly by adding parentheses `()`.
- This will ensure that the `copy_options()` function is executed and its return value is included in the SQL query.
- Verify that other variables such as `colnames`, `table`, `source`, and `creds` are correctly passed in the `cursor.execute` statement.

## Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
    def copy(self, cursor, f):
        """
        Defines copying from s3 into redshift.
    
        If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
        """
        logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
        colnames = ''
        if len(self.columns) > 0:
            colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
            colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)
    
        cursor.execute("""
         COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
         CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
         {options}
         ;""".format(
            table=self.table,
            colnames=colnames,
            source=f,
            creds=self._credentials(),
            options=self.copy_options())
        )
```

By making these changes, the `copy` function should now correctly execute the `copy_options` method and include its return value in the `COPY` command.
