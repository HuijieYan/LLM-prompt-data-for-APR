## Analysis:
1. The buggy function `copy` is trying to copy data from S3 into Redshift using the `COPY` command.
2. The issue seems to be with the formatting of the SQL query within the `cursor.execute` statement.
3. The `copy_options` method is supposed to generate additional copy options that are missing due to an error in the query formatting.
4. The bug seems to be related to the `options=self.copy_options` part of the query, which should be calling the `copy_options` method to include additional options.

## Bug Cause:
The bug is caused by not invoking the `copy_options` method correctly within the formatted SQL query string. Instead of calling the method, the buggy code is referencing the method itself as an object without invoking it.

## Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, the `copy_options` method should be called to generate the additional copy options and include them in the `COPY` command SQL query. This can be achieved by adding parenthesis to the method call in the formatted string.

## Corrected Version:
```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options()  # Call the method to include copy options
    )
```
