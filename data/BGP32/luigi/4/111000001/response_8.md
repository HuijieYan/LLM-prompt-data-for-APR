## Analysis:
1. The `copy` function is responsible for copying data from S3 into Redshift.
2. The function constructs a SQL query using the provided attributes like `table`, `columns`, `source`, `creds`, and `copy_options`.
3. The buggy line in the function is where it constructs the SQL query using `copy_options`, which is a function but being used as a variable.
4. The bug arises because `copy_options` function is not being called in the SQL query construction.
5. To fix the bug, we need to call the `copy_options` function to get the proper options for the copy operation.

## Bug Fix:
Here is the corrected version of the `copy` function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options())
    )
```

The bug is fixed by calling `copy_options` function with `()` at the end to ensure that the function is executed and its return value is used in the SQL query construction.
