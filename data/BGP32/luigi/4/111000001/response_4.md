## Analysis:
The `copy` function in the `S3CopyToTable` class is supposed to define copying data from S3 into Redshift. However, there are potential issues in the `copy` function:
1. The `copy_options` function is called without executing it properly, resulting in the copy_options function not being executed and used properly in the `COPY` query.
2. The `options` parameter in the `cursor.execute` method is not correctly executed as a function but instead is treated as a variable, leading to potential errors in the COPY query.

## Bug Cause:
The bug is caused because the `copy_options` function is not being called properly, and the `options` parameter in the `cursor.execute` method is not executed as a function.

## Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
1. Call the `copy_options` function properly to get the correct options for the `COPY` query.
2. Properly execute the `options` parameter in the `cursor.execute` method as a function to ensure the correct behavior.

## Corrected Version:
```python
    def copy(self, cursor, f):
        """
        Defines copying from s3 into redshift.
    
        If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
        """
        logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
        colnames = ''
        if len(self.columns) > 0:
            colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
            colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)
    
        cursor.execute("""
         COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
         CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
         {options}
         ;""".format(
            table=self.table,
            colnames=colnames,
            source=f,
            creds=self._credentials(),
            options=self.copy_options())  # Call copy_options function here
        )
```
