1. The buggy function `copy` within the `S3CopyToTable` class in `luigi/contrib/redshift.py` is responsible for copying data from an S3 source into a Redshift table. The function constructs a SQL query using the provided attributes and executes it using the `cursor` object passed as an argument.

2. The potential error locations in the buggy function are:
   - Incorrect usage of `copy_options` method in the `COPY` query construction.
   - Missing parentheses while calling the `copy_options` method.
   
3. The bug in the function arises from incorrectly calling the `copy_options` method. In the line `options=self.copy_options`, this code is assigning the method itself to the `options` variable, rather than calling and including the result of the method in the SQL query.

4. To fix the bug:
   - We need to call the `copy_options` method instead of directly assigning it in the SQL query.
   - Correct the SQL query construction by adding missing parentheses while calling the `copy_options` method.
  
5. Here is the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
    def copy(self, cursor, f):
        """
        Defines copying from s3 into redshift.
    
        If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
        """
        logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
        colnames = ''
        if len(self.columns) > 0:
            colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
            colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)
    
        cursor.execute("""
         COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
         CREDENTIALS 'aws_access_key_id={key};aws_secret_access_key={secret}'
         {options}
         ;""".format(
            table=self.table,
            colnames=colnames,
            source=f,
            key=self.aws_access_key_id,
            secret=self.aws_secret_access_key,
            options=self.copy_options())
        )
```

In this corrected version, we have added parentheses while calling the `copy_options` method to ensure its execution and included the AWS access key and secret in the `CREDENTIALS` section of the `COPY` query.
