### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `copy` in the `S3CopyToTable` class is responsible for copying data from S3 into Redshift. The issue is related to the handling of the `columns` attribute when it's set to `None`.
2. The bug occurs in the line `if len(self.columns) > 0:` where it tries to get the length of `self.columns` without checking if it is None, causing a `TypeError` when `columns` is `None`.
3. The root cause of the bug is that when the `columns` attribute is `None`, it should not attempt to get the length of it. This results in a failure when trying to construct the SQL query for the copy operation.
4. To fix the bug, we should check if `self.columns` is not `None` before trying to get its length. If it's not `None`, then proceed with constructing the column names for the `COPY` statement.
5. Here is the corrected version of the `copy` function to address the bug:

### Corrected Version:
```python
    def copy(self, cursor, f):
        """
        Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

        If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
        """
        logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
        colnames = ''
        if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:  # Check if columns is not None
            colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
            colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

        cursor.execute("""
         COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
         CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
         {options}
         ;""".format(
            table=self.table,
            colnames=colnames,
            source=f,
            creds=self._credentials(),
            options=self.copy_options)
        )
```

By adding the check `if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:`, the corrected version of the function will now handle cases where `columns` is `None` and prevent the `TypeError` that was occurring previously. This fix addresses the issue reported on GitHub related to failing when `columns` is `None`.
