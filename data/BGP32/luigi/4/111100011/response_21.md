## Analysis:
1. The buggy function `copy` within the class `S3CopyToTable` in the file `luigi/contrib/redshift.py` is responsible for inserting data from S3 into Redshift. The issue seems to stem from the handling of the `columns` attribute when it is set to `None`.
2. The failing test in `test/contrib/redshift_test.py` creates a task (`DummyS3CopyToTableKey`) with `columns` set to `None` and verifies that the `COPY` statement executed matches the expected format.
3. The GitHub issue points out that providing `columns = None` leads to a `TypeError` due to the incorrect handling of `self.columns` in the buggy function. The suggested solution is to check if `self.columns` is not `None` before attempting to get its length.
4. To fix the bug, we should update the logic in the `copy` function to account for cases where `self.columns` might be `None`.
5. Based on the analysis and provided information, a correction to the `copy` function is necessary to address the bug.


## Corrected Version:
```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:  # Check if self.columns is not None
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options())
    )
```

By making the adjustment in the `copy` function to check if `self.columns` is not `None` before accessing its length, we can prevent the `TypeError` when `columns` is set to `None`. This correction aligns with the suggested solution provided in the GitHub issue and should resolve the bug identified in the failing test scenario.
