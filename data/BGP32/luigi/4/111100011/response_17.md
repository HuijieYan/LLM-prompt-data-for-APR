### Analysis:
1. **Buggy Function Connection**: The buggy function `copy()` is located within the `S3CopyToTable` class in the `luigi/contrib/redshift.py` file. It is responsible for copying data from S3 to Redshift.
   
2. **Related Functions**: The `copy()` function calls the `copy_options()` function from the same class.

3. **Test Code**: The failing test function `test_s3_copy_with_nonetype_columns` attempts to test the behavior when `columns` is set to `None`. It creates a `DummyS3CopyToTableKey` instance and executes the `run()` method. It then mocks the connection cursor and asserts the SQL query generated by the `copy()` function.

4. **GitHub Issue**: The GitHub issue highlights the specific problem where providing `columns = None` results in a `TypeError` due to checking the length of `self.columns` without considering it could be `None`.

### Identifying the Bug:
The bug in the `copy()` function is checking the length of `self.columns` without verifying if it is `None` first. This leads to a `TypeError` when `columns` are set to `None`, as noticed in the failing test.

### Bug Cause:
The bug arises from the assumption that `self.columns` will always have a value, leading to an error when it is `None`.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to handle the case where `self.columns` might be `None` before attempting to get its length. We should only calculate `colnames` if `self.columns` is not `None`.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options())
    )
```

By checking if `self.columns` is not `None` before calculating `colnames`, we can prevent the `TypeError` issue when `columns` are set to `None`.
