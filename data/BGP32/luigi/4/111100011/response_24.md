### Analysis:
1. The buggy function is `copy` within the class `S3CopyToTable` in the `redshift.py` file of Luigi library.
2. The bug seems to be related to the handling of `columns` when it is `None` in the `copy` function.
3. The failing test `test_s3_copy_with_nonetype_columns` is designed to test this specific scenario where `columns` is `None`. The bug occurs because the code does not handle the case when `self.columns` is `None` before trying to get the length of it, causing a `TypeError`.
4. To fix the bug, we need to check if `self.columns` is not `None` before trying to get its length.

### Bug Cause:
The bug occurs because the code assumes `self.columns` will always be a list and tries to get its length without checking if it is `None` or not. This causes a `TypeError` when `self.columns` is `None`.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to add a check to verify that `self.columns` is not `None` before trying to get its length. If `self.columns` is `None`, we can handle it appropriately to avoid the `TypeError`.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns is not None:  # Check if columns is not None
        if len(self.columns) > 0:
            colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
            colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options())
    )
```

By adding the check `if self.columns is not None:` before trying to access the length of `self.columns`, we ensure that the code handles the case when `self.columns` is `None` without causing a `TypeError`.
