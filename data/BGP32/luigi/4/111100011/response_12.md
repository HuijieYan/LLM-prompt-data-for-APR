### Analysis:
The buggy function `copy` within the `S3CopyToTable` class in the `luigi/contrib/redshift.py` file is failing due to a `TypeError` caused by checking the length of `self.columns` when it is `None`. This bug is related to the GitHub issue titled "Redshift COPY fails in luigi 2.7.1 when columns are not provided", which provides insights into the root cause and suggests a possible solution.

### Potential Error Location:
The line causing the issue is:
```python
if len(self.columns) > 0:
```
Here, when `self.columns` is `None`, it raises a `TypeError` as `NoneType` does not have a length.

### Cause of the Bug:
The bug occurs in the `copy` function when trying to get the length of `self.columns` without checking if it is `None`. This leads to a `TypeError` when `self.columns` is `None`, as observed in the failing test `test_s3_copy_with_nonetype_columns`.

The GitHub issue suggests modifying the check to `if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0`. This change ensures that it only proceeds to check the length if `self.columns` is not `None`.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to update the check for the length of `self.columns` to handle the case when it is `None` before trying to get its length.

### Corrected Version of the `copy` Function:
```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0: # Check if self.columns is not None
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

By incorporating the suggested fix into the corrected version of the `copy` function, we address the bug reported in the GitHub issue and ensure that the function works correctly even when `self.columns` is `None`. This corrected version should now pass the failing test `test_s3_copy_with_nonetype_columns`.
