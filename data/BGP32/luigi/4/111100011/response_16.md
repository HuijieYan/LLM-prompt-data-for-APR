## Analysis:
1. The buggy function `copy` in the `S3CopyToTable` class is supposed to handle copying data from S3 into Redshift.
2. The bug seems to be related to the handling of `self.columns`, where the buggy function tries to check the length of `self.columns` without properly handling the scenario when `self.columns` is `None`.
3. The failing test `test_s3_copy_with_nonetype_columns` verifies the behavior of the `copy` function when `columns` is `None`.
4. The GitHub issue highlights that the bug occurs when `columns` are not provided and suggests a solution to handle this case.

## Bug Cause:
The bug occurs because the buggy function does not properly handle the scenario when `self.columns` is `None`. This leads to a `TypeError: object of type 'NoneType' has no len()` error when trying to check the length of `self.columns`.

## Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to modify the logic in the `copy` function to properly handle the case when `self.columns` is `None`. The suggested solution from the GitHub issue is to change the line `if len(self.columns) > 0:` to `if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:` to avoid the `TypeError`.

## Corrected Version:
```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options())
    )
```

By modifying the `if` condition to check if `self.columns` is not `None` before checking its length, the bug can be fixed. This corrected version should handle the scenario when `columns` are `None` and pass the failing test, resolving the issue reported on GitHub.
