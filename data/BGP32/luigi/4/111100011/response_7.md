## Analysis:
1. The buggy function `copy` in the `S3CopyToTable` class is failing when `self.columns` is `None`, leading to a `TypeError: object of type 'NoneType' has no len()`.
2. The failing test `test_s3_copy_with_nonetype_columns` is specifically testing the behavior when `columns` is `None`.
3. The GitHub issue highlights the root cause of the problem and suggests a solution to handle the case when `self.columns` is `None`.

## Bug Cause:
The bug is caused by the buggy function assuming `self.columns` will always be a valid list of columns and trying to get its length without checking if it is `None`. This results in a `TypeError` when trying to retrieve the length of `None`.

## Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to modify the `copy` function to check if `self.columns` is not `None` before attempting to get its length. If `self.columns` is `None`, we can handle it gracefully to prevent the `TypeError`.

## Updated Corrected Version:
```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)
    
    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options())
    )
```

This updated version of the `copy` function includes a check `if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0` to handle the case when `self.columns` is `None`. Additionally, the call to `self.copy_options` is corrected by adding parentheses to call the function. This should resolve the issue and ensure that the test `test_s3_copy_with_nonetype_columns` passes successfully.
