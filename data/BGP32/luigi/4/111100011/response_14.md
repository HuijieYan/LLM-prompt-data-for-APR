### Analysis:
1. The buggy function is the `copy` method inside the `S3CopyToTable` class in the `luigi/contrib/redshift.py` file.
2. The error in the buggy function is related to checking the length of `self.columns`, which is not handled properly when `self.columns` is `None`.
3. The failing test `test_s3_copy_with_nonetype_columns` simulates the scenario where `columns` is `None`. The GitHub issue mentions that the bug arises when `columns` is `None`.
4. The cause of the bug is that the `copy` method does not handle the case when `self.columns` is `None`. The code tries to retrieve the length of `self.columns`, leading to a `TypeError`.
5. To fix the bug, we need to check if `self.columns` is not `None` before trying to get its length.

### Bug Fix:
```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''

    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

By adding the `if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:` condition, we ensure that the code only tries to retrieve the length of `self.columns` if `self.columns` is not `None`. This fix addresses the issue mentioned in the GitHub report and should make the function work correctly in the scenario where `columns` is `None`.
