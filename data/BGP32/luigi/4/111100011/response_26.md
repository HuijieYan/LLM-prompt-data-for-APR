## Analysis:
1. The buggy function `copy()` in the `S3CopyToTable` class is responsible for inserting a data set into Redshift from S3.
2. The bug occurs when `self.columns` is set to `None`, leading to a `TypeError` due to the `len()` function being called on a `NoneType` object.
3. The failing test `test_s3_copy_with_nonetype_columns` mocks the `RedshiftTarget` object and expects a certain `COPY` SQL statement to be executed.
4. To fix the bug, we need to check if `self.columns` has a valid value before trying to calculate its length in the `copy()` function.

## Bug Cause:
The bug occurs because the buggy function does not handle the case where `self.columns` is set to `None`. It directly calculates the length of the columns without checking if they are valid.

## Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
1. Check if `self.columns` is not `None` before trying to calculate its length.
2. If `self.columns` is not `None`, proceed with generating the `colnames` string; otherwise, leave `colnames` as an empty string.

## Corrected Version of the Buggy Function:
```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from S3 into Redshift.
    
    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns is not None:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options())
    )
```

By adding the check `if self.columns is not None` before processing the columns, we ensure that the bug causing the `TypeError` is fixed. This corrected version should pass the failing test and resolve the GitHub issue related to Redshift COPY failures when columns are not provided.
