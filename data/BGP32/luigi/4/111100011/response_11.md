### Analysis:
1. **Buggy Function:** The `copy` function within the `S3CopyToTable` class in `luigi/contrib/redshift.py`.
   
2. **Error Location:** The error occurs in the line where the length of `self.columns` is checked without ensuring that `self.columns` is not `None`.

3. **Cause of the Bug:**
   The bug is caused by directly checking the length of `self.columns` without verifying if `self.columns` is `None`. This results in a `TypeError` when `self.columns` is `None`, as shown in the failing test in the GitHub issue.

4. **Strategy for Fixing the Bug:**
   - Check if `self.columns` is not `None` before checking its length.
   - If `self.columns` is not `None`, then proceed to get the column names; otherwise, handle the case where columns are not provided.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    
    if self.columns is not None:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

By adding the check `if self.columns is not None`, we ensure that we only try to get the column names if `self.columns` is not `None`. This change will prevent the `TypeError` when columns are not provided.

This corrected version should resolve the issue reported in the GitHub ticket and pass the failing test case provided.
