## Analysis:
- The buggy function `copy` inside the `S3CopyToTable` class in `redshift.py` file of `luigi` package is responsible for inserting a data set into Redshift from S3.
- The issue mentioned on GitHub points out that running Redshift COPY jobs with `columns = None` to prevent table creation fails with a `TypeError: object of type 'NoneType' has no len()`.
- The bug seems to be related to the handling of `self.columns` when it is set to `None`.

## Identified Error:
- The buggy function assumes that `self.columns` will always be a list and tries to access its length directly without checking if it is `None`.
- This assumption causes a `TypeError` when `self.columns` is `None`.

## Bug Cause:
- The buggy function does not handle the case where `self.columns` is set to `None`. It directly tries to access the length of `self.columns` without first checking if it is `None`.
- This leads to a runtime error when `self.columns` is `None`, as seen in the failing test.

## Bug Fix Strategy:
- A proper fix would involve checking if `self.columns` is not `None` before trying to access its length.
- By adding a condition to check if `self.columns` is not `None` before proceeding with further operations, we can avoid the `TypeError`.

## Corrected Version:
```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from S3 into Redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:  # Check if self.columns is not None before accessing its length
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

By making this change, the corrected version of the `copy` function should now be able to handle the case where `self.columns` is set to `None` and pass the failing test.
