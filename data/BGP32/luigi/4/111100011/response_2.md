### Analysis:
1. The buggy function is `copy` inside the `S3CopyToTable` class in the `luigi/contrib/redshift.py` file.
2. The function is attempting to construct a SQL `COPY` statement to copy data from S3 to Redshift.
3. The bug occurs when `self.columns` is None, leading to an error due to trying to get the length of a NoneType object.
4. The GitHub issue suggests a solution to handle the case when `self.columns` is None in order to prevent the TypeError.

### Bug Cause:
- The bug occurs in the `copy` function when attempting to check the length of `self.columns` without first checking if it exists.

### Proposed Fix:
- Update the condition `if len(self.columns) > 0:` to `if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:` to handle the case when `self.columns` is None.

### Corrected Version of the function:
```python
    def copy(self, cursor, f):
        """
        Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

        If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
        """
        logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
        colnames = ''
        if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:  # Updated condition
            colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
            colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

        cursor.execute("""
         COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
         CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
         {options}
         ;""".format(
            table=self.table,
            colnames=colnames,
            source=f,
            creds=self._credentials(),
            options=self.copy_options())
        )
```

By making the proposed fix in the `copy` function, this should address the bug identified in the GitHub issue and allow the function to handle the case when `self.columns` is None without raising a TypeError.
