## Analysis:
1. The buggy function `copy` in the `S3CopyToTable` class is supposed to define the copying process from s3 into Redshift but it is failing due to the `columns` attribute being `None`.
2. The `copy` function is using `self.columns` without checking if it's `None`. This is causing the `TypeError` when trying to determine the length of `None`.
3. The failing test `test_s3_copy_with_nonetype_columns` is mocking the necessary objects and calling the `copy` method on `DummyS3CopyToTable`. The issue on GitHub highlights the root cause of the failure due to `self.columns` being `None`.
4. To fix the bug, we need to check if `self.columns` is not `None` before trying to get its length in the `copy` function.

## Bug Fix:
```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:  # Check if self.columns is not None
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options())
    )
```

By adding the check `if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0`, we ensure that `self.columns` is not `None` before trying to determine its length. This modification will prevent the `TypeError` related to `NoneType` and should fix the bug reported in the GitHub issue.
