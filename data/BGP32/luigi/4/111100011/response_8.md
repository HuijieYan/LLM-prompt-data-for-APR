## Analysis:
The buggy function `copy` in the `S3CopyToTable` class is failing when the `columns` attribute is set to `None`. This causes a `TypeError: object of type 'NoneType' has no len()` error.

## Cause of the bug:
The bug occurs because the current implementation of the `copy` function does not handle the case where `self.columns` is `None` before trying to calculate the length of the `columns`.

In the failing test, a `DummyS3CopyToTableKey` task is created with `columns=None` and then the `copy` function is called. This triggers the bug as it expects `self.columns` to be a list but gets `None` instead.

## Strategy for fixing the bug:
To address this bug, we need to check if `self.columns` is not `None` before trying to calculate its length in the `copy` function. This will prevent the `TypeError` when `columns` is not provided explicitly.

## Corrected Version:
```python
    def copy(self, cursor, f):
        """
        Defines copying from s3 into redshift.
    
        If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
        """
        logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
        colnames = ''
        if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:
            colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
            colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)
    
        cursor.execute("""
         COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
         CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
         {options}
         ;""".format(
            table=self.table,
            colnames=colnames,
            source=f,
            creds=self._credentials(),
            options=self.copy_options())
        )
```

In the corrected version, we added a check `if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0` before processing the `columns`. This change ensures that the code handles the case where `self.columns` is `None` gracefully, preventing the `TypeError` from occurring. This fix aligns with the suggestion mentioned in the GitHub issue.

This corrected version should resolve the bug and now the `S3CopyToTable` class will be able to handle cases where `columns` attribute is not provided explicitly.
