## Analysis:
1. The buggy function is `copy` within the `S3CopyToTable` class in the `luigi.contrib.redshift.py` file.
2. The function is trying to execute a SQL `COPY` command with specific parameters.
3. The bug arises when `self.columns` is `None`, causing an error when trying to get its length.
4. The issue in GitHub suggests using `if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0` as a possible fix.

## Bug Cause:
The buggy function `copy` in the `S3CopyToTable` class fails when `self.columns` is `None` because it tries to get the length of `None`, resulting in a `TypeError`. This behavior is inconsistent with the design expectation and leads to the bug reported in the GitHub issue.

## How to Fix:
To fix the bug, modify the condition where the length of columns is checked. By adding an extra check to ensure `self.columns` is not `None`, the function can avoid the `TypeError` when `columns` is not provided.

## Corrected Version:
```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:  # Check if self.columns is not None
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options())
    )
``` 

By making this change, the function will no longer raise a `TypeError` when `self.columns` is `None`, and it should pass the failing test and resolve the issue reported in the GitHub bug.
