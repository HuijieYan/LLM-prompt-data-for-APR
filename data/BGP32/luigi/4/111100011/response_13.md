Analysis:
1. The buggy function `copy` in the `S3CopyToTable` class is responsible for inserting a dataset into Redshift from S3. The bug seems to be related to handling the `columns` attribute when it is `None`.
2. The bug is likely in the condition where the length of `self.columns` is checked. If `self.columns` is `None`, then calling `len(self.columns)` will raise a `TypeError`.
3. The failing test `test_s3_copy_with_nonetype_columns` creates a `DummyS3CopyToTableKey` task with `columns=None` and expects the `COPY` SQL query to have no columns specified. The test fails due to the `TypeError`.
4. To fix the bug, we should explicitly check if `self.columns` is not `None` before checking its length to avoid the `TypeError`.
5. Below is the corrected version of the `copy` function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns is not None:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options())
    )
```

By explicitly checking if `self.columns` is not `None` before accessing its length, we prevent the `TypeError` that occurs when `self.columns` is `None`. This change should resolve the issue reported on GitHub and make the test case pass successfully.
