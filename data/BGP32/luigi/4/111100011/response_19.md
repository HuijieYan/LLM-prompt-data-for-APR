## Analysis:
1. The buggy function `copy()` in the `S3CopyToTable` class is responsible for copying data from S3 into Redshift.
2. The bug seems to be related to the `colnames` variable calculation based on the `self.columns` attribute.
3. The failing test `test_s3_copy_with_nonetype_columns` checks the behavior when `columns=None` is provided, which triggers the error due to trying to use `len()` on a NoneType object.
4. Based on the GitHub issue description, the bug was introduced in Luigi 2.7.1 and the proposed solution suggests adding a check for `if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:` to prevent the error.
   
## Bug Cause:
The bug occurs because the `copy()` function does not handle the case when `self.columns` is None, causing an error when trying to get the length of it.

## Proposed Fix:
To fix the bug, we need to add a check to ensure that `self.columns` is not None before attempting to calculate the `colnames`.

## Corrected Version:
```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:  # Check if self.columns is not None
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options())
    )
```

By adding the check `if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:`, we ensure that the bug related to `NoneType` error when `columns=None` is fixed. This corrected version should now pass the failing test and resolve the issue reported on GitHub.
