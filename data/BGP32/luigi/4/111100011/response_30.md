### Analysis:
- The buggy function `copy` in the `S3CopyToTable` class from `luigi/contrib/redshift.py` is supposed to define copying data from S3 into Redshift, but it's causing an issue when `self.columns` is set to `None`.
- The failing test `test_s3_copy_with_nonetype_columns` in `test/contrib/redshift_test.py` verifies the behavior when `columns` is set to `None`.
- The GitHub issue highlights that the bug occurs due to checking the length of `self.columns` without verifying if it's not `None`.

### Bug:
The bug occurs in the `copy` function of `S3CopyToTable` class when `self.columns` is set to `None`. It raises a `TypeError: object of type 'NoneType' has no len()` error because the length of `None` cannot be determined.

### Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to update the condition where we are checking the length of `self.columns`. We should first check if `self.columns` is not `None` before checking its length. This will prevent the `TypeError` when `columns` is `None`.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options())
    )
```

### Summary:
The updated `copy` function now first checks if `self.columns` is not `None` before checking its length. This modification should fix the bug reported in the GitHub issue and allow the test `test_s3_copy_with_nonetype_columns` to pass successfully.
