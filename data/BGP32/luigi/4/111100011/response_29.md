## Analysis:
1. The buggy function `copy` is within the `S3CopyToTable` class, which is a subclass of `rdbms.CopyToTable` and `_CredentialsMixin`.
2. The function is responsible for inserting data from S3 into Redshift.
3. The buggy function is failing due to the check `if len(self.columns) > 0:` when `self.columns` is None.
4. The failing test `test_s3_copy_with_nonetype_columns` mocks the `RedshiftTarget` and calls the `copy` function with `columns=None`.
5. The GitHub issue points out that `self.columns` being None causes the error, and suggests a potential fix by checking `if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0`.

## Bug Cause:
The bug is caused by the buggy function not handling the case where `self.columns` is None. This leads to a `TypeError` when trying to get the length of a `NoneType`.

## Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we should modify the check for `self.columns` in the `copy` function to first check if `self.columns` is not None before checking its length.

## Corrected Version:
```python
    def copy(self, cursor, f):
        """
        Defines copying from s3 into redshift.
    
        If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
        """
        logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
        colnames = ''
        if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:
            colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
            colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)
    
        cursor.execute("""
         COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
         CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
         {options}
         ;""".format(
            table=self.table,
            colnames=colnames,
            source=f,
            creds=self._credentials(),
            options=self.copy_options())
        )
```

In the corrected version, we first check if `self.columns` is not None before attempting to get its length. This change ensures that the buggy function handles the case where `columns` is None, as suggested in the GitHub issue.
