### 1. Analyzing the buggy function:
- The buggy function `copy` is part of the `S3CopyToTable` class in the `luigi/contrib/redshift.py` file.
- The class is a template task for inserting a data set into Redshift from S3.
- The function is responsible for defining the copying process from S3 into Redshift.
- The failing test `test_s3_copy_with_nonetype_columns` is in the `test/contrib/redshift_test.py` file.

### 2. Identifying potential error locations:
- The error could be related to the conditional check for the length of `self.columns`.
- Since the failing test provides `columns=None` to the task, the bug might be due to how `self.columns` is handled in the `copy` function.

### 3. Explaining the cause of the bug:
- The failing test indicates that providing `columns=None` causes the `TypeError: object of type 'NoneType' has no len()`.
- The bug might be due to the assumption that `self.columns` always exists before checking its length.
- The GitHub issue suggests a potential fix by checking `if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0` to handle cases where `self.columns` is `None`.
- The bug arises from the lack of handling `None` values for `self.columns` in the `copy` function.

### 4. Suggested strategy for fixing the bug:
- Update the `copy` function to check if `self.columns` is not `None` before checking its length to avoid the `TypeError`.
- Implement the suggested fix from the GitHub issue to properly handle the case where `self.columns` is `None`.

### 5. Corrected version of the buggy function:
```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from S3 into Redshift.
    
    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    
    if self.columns is not None and len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options())
    )
```

### Summary:
- The corrected version of the `copy` function checks if `self.columns` is not `None` before checking its length.
- This will prevent the `TypeError` when `columns=None` is provided in the test.
- The fix aligns with the suggested solution from the GitHub issue and should resolve the bug reported for Redshift COPY jobs when columns are not provided.
