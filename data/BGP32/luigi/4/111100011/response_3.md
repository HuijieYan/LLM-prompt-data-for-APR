## Analysis:
1. The buggy function `copy` in the class `S3CopyToTable` is attempting to construct an SQL `COPY` query for Redshift.
2. The bug occurs when the `columns` attribute is set to `None`, causing a `TypeError: object of type 'NoneType' has no len()`.
3. The failing test `test_s3_copy_with_nonetype_columns` is mocking the behavior and expects the `COPY` query to be constructed properly.
4. The GitHub issue indicates that the bug is related to luigi 2.7.1 and suggests changing the condition check for `len(self.columns) > 0` to `if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0`.

## Bug Cause:
The bug occurs because the buggy function does not check if `self.columns` is `None` before attempting to get its length.

## Strategy for fixing the bug:
1. Modify the `copy` function to include a check for `None` before getting the length of `self.columns`.
2. Update the condition to `if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0`.
3. Make sure to handle the case when `self.columns` is `None`.

## Corrected version of the buggy function:
```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns is not None:  # Check if columns is not None
        if len(self.columns) > 0:
            colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
            colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options())
    )
```

By making these changes, the corrected version of the `copy` function should now properly handle the case when `columns` is `None`, resolving the bug and passing the failing test case.
