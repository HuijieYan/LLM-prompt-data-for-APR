### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `copy` in the `S3CopyToTable` class of `luigi.contrib.redshift.py` is failing due to an issue related to the `self.columns` attribute being `None`.
2. The failing test `test_s3_copy_with_nonetype_columns` in `redshift_test.py` mocks the behavior of the `RedshiftTarget` and expects a specific `COPY` SQL statement to be executed.
3. The GitHub issue indicates that the bug arises when `self.columns` is `None`, causing a `TypeError`. The suggested fix involves checking if `self.columns` is not `None` before using `len(self.columns)`.
4. To fix the bug, we need to update the `copy` function to handle the case when `self.columns` is `None` by adding a check for `self.columns` being truthy before checking its length.

### Solution:
Here is the corrected version of the `copy` function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options())
    )
```

By adding the `if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0` check, we ensure that the `colnames` variable is only constructed if `self.columns` is not `None`. This change addresses the bug reported in the GitHub issue by handling the case when `self.columns` is `None`.

Now, the corrected function will not throw a `TypeError` when `self.columns` is `None`, and it should pass the failing test `test_s3_copy_with_nonetype_columns`.
