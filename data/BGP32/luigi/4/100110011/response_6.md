### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `copy` in `luigi/contrib/redshift.py` is failing due to `TypeError: object of type 'NoneType' has no len()` when `self.columns` is `None`.
2. The failing test `test_s3_copy_with_nonetype_columns` in `test/contrib/redshift_test.py` confirms the issue by passing `columns=None` to the `DummyS3CopyToTableKey` task.
3. The GitHub issue details the exact scenario causing the problem and proposes a solution to handle `None` values in `self.columns`.
4. The bug occurs because the code does not handle the case when `self.columns` is `None` before attempting to retrieve its length. 
5. To fix the bug, we can modify the line `if len(self.columns) > 0:` to `if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:` to ensure we only check the length when `self.columns` is not `None`.

### Updated Corrected Version:
```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

By updating the `copy` function as shown above, we handle the scenario in which `self.columns` is `None` before trying to access its length, fixing the bug and ensuring the corrected version passes the failing test and resolves the GitHub issue.
