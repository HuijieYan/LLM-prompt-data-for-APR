### Analysis:
- The buggy function `copy` in the `luigi.contrib.redshift.py` file is failing when the `columns` parameter is set to `None`.
- The failing test `test_s3_copy_with_nonetype_columns` in the `test/contrib/redshift_test.py` file is trying to test the `copy` function with a `None` value for the `columns` parameter.
- The error message indicates a `TypeError` because the code is trying to get the length of a `NoneType` object.
- The GitHub issue mentions that there is a bug related to Redshift COPY jobs failing when `columns` are not provided.

### Potential Error Location:
The error is occurring in the `copy` function at this line:
```python
if len(self.columns) > 0:
```
Here, the code is checking the length of `self.columns` without handling the case where `self.columns` is `None`.

### Cause of the Bug:
The bug is caused by the code not handling the `None` value for the `columns` parameter. When `columns` is `None`, the code tries to get the length of a `NoneType` object, which leads to a `TypeError`.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to check if `self.columns` is not `None` before trying to get its length. We should also handle the case where `self.columns` is an empty list.

### Corrected Version:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns is not None and len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

By adding a check for `self.columns is not None` before checking its length, we make sure to handle the case where `columns` is `None`. This corrected version should now pass the failing test and resolve the issue mentioned on GitHub.
