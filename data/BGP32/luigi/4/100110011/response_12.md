### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `copy` in `redshift.py` is trying to handle the case where `self.columns` could be `None` by checking its length. However, it is attempting to call `len()` directly on `self.columns`, which would result in a `TypeError` if `self.columns` is `None`.
2. The failing test `test_s3_copy_with_nonetype_columns` creates an instance of `DummyS3CopyToTableKey` with `columns=None` and invokes the `run()` method, which eventually calls the buggy `copy` method.
3. The error message indicates that a `TypeError` is raised within the `copy` function due to calling `len()` on a `NoneType` object.
4. The GitHub issue suggests a fix by adding an additional check `if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:` to handle the case when `self.columns` is `None`.

### Bug Cause:
The bug occurs because the buggy function does not handle the case when `self.columns` is `None`, resulting in a `TypeError` when trying to get the length of `None`.

### Bug Fix:
To fix the bug, we need to add a check to ensure that `self.columns` is not `None` before checking its length.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns is not None and len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

By adding the `if self.columns is not None and len(self.columns) > 0:` check, we ensure that the buggy function can handle the case where `self.columns` is `None` without causing a `TypeError`.
