### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `copy` is trying to check the length of `self.columns` without verifying if `self.columns` is not None. This causes a `TypeError` when `self.columns` is None.
2. The failing test `test_s3_copy_with_nonetype_columns` creates a task with columns set to None and expects the copy method to handle the case where columns are None properly.
3. The error message clearly states that `TypeError: object of type 'NoneType' has no len()` is occurring when trying to check the length of `self.columns`.
4. The GitHub issue explains that this bug occurs in Luigi 2.7.1 when columns are not provided. The potential solution suggested is to modify the if condition to check if `self.columns` is not None before checking its length.

### Bug Cause:
The bug occurs because the buggy function `copy` is directly trying to check the length of `self.columns` without verifying if it is not None. This causes an error when `self.columns` is None.

### Bug Fix:
To fix the bug, we need to update the if condition in the `copy` function to first check if `self.columns` is not None before checking its length.

### Updated Corrected Version:
```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:  # Check if self.columns is not None before getting the length
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute(
        """
         COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
         CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
         {options}
         ;""".format(
            table=self.table,
            colnames=colnames,
            source=f,
            creds=self._credentials(),
            options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

By updating the condition to first check if `self.columns` is not None, we ensure that the buggy function `copy` handles the case where columns are None gracefully. This corrected version should address the bug and make the function work correctly with the failing test.
