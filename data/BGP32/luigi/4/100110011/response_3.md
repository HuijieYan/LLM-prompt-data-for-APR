### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `copy` in the `redshift.py` file is failing due to the presence of `self.columns` being `None`, which leads to a `TypeError` when trying to retrieve its length.
2. The failing test `test_s3_copy_with_nonetype_columns` in `redshift_test.py` creates an instance of `DummyS3CopyToTableKey` with `columns=None` and then calls the `run` method, which in turn calls the `copy` method with `self.copy(cursor, path)`.
3. The error occurs because the condition `if len(self.columns) > 0` is invalid when `self.columns` is `None`, resulting in a `TypeError`.
4. The suggested fix from the GitHub issue is to change the condition to `if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0` to handle the case where `self.columns` is `None`.
5. The corrected version involves updating the condition to handle the `None` case.

### Bug Fix:
```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

By updating the condition to check if `self.columns` is not `None` before checking its length, the bug should be fixed. This correction should allow the function to handle the case where `columns` is `None` without triggering a `TypeError`.
