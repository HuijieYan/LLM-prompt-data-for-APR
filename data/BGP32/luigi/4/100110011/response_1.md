### Bug Analysis:
The buggy function `copy` in the `luigi/contrib/redshift.py` file is causing a `TypeError` when `self.columns` is `None`. This bug is revealed during the `test_s3_copy_with_nonetype_columns` test case in the `test/contrib/redshift_test.py` file.

The error message indicates that the issue occurs in the `copy` function due to trying to get the length of a `NoneType` object.

The GitHub issue titled "Redshift COPY fails in luigi 2.7.1 when columns are not provided" provides information about this bug and suggests a solution to change the condition in the `copy` function.

### Bug Location:
The potential error location in the `copy` function is at the line:
```python
if len(self.columns) > 0:
```
where `self.columns` being `None` can cause the `TypeError`.

### Bug Cause:
The bug occurs because the code does not check if `self.columns` is `None` before trying to get its length. When `columns=None`, the `if len(self.columns) > 0` check throws a `TypeError` as `NoneType` does not have a length property.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we should first verify if `self.columns` is not `None` before checking its length. By adding a check for `self.columns` being not `None` in the conditional statement, we can prevent the `TypeError` from occurring.

### Corrected Version:
Here is the corrected version of the `copy` function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

This corrected version should now handle the case when `self.columns` is `None` and not throw a `TypeError`.
