Based on the provided information, it seems that the bug occurs in the `copy` function of the `luigi/contrib/redshift.py` file. The bug arises when the `columns` attribute is `None`, resulting in a `TypeError` when the program attempts to check the length of `None`.

### Bug Explanation:
- **Bug Location**: The bug is situated in the `copy` function at line 338 of `redshift.py`. The issue arises when the length of `self.columns` is checked without verifying if `self.columns` is not `None`.
- **Cause of Bug**: When `self.columns` is `None`, attempting to get the length of `None` leads to a `TypeError`.
- **Failing Test Explanation**: The failing test `test_s3_copy_with_nonetype_columns` creates an instance of `DummyS3CopyToTableKey` with `columns=None`, triggering the bug within the `copy` function.
- **Error Message Insight**: The error message points out the exact cause - trying to get the length of `None`.
- **GitHub Issue Information**: The GitHub issue suggests modifying the condition to `if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0` to handle the `None` case.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug and address the suggestions from the GitHub issue:
1. Modify the condition to check if `self.columns` is not `None` before checking its length.
2. If `self.columns` is `None`, the code should proceed without attempting to get its length.

### Corrected Version of the `copy` function:
```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns is not None and len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

By updating the `copy` function with the suggested condition, the bug should be resolved, and the corrected version of the function will now handle the case when `self.columns` is `None` without causing a `TypeError`. This modification will allow the function to operate as intended and pass the failing test case.
