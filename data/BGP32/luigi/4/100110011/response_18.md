### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `copy` in `luigi/contrib/redshift.py` is failing due to a `TypeError` caused when trying to get the length of `self.columns` when it is `None`.
2. The failing test `test_s3_copy_with_nonetype_columns` in `test/contrib/redshift_test.py` sets the `columns` attribute of the task to `None`, triggering the bug in the `copy` function.
3. The error message clearly states that a `TypeError` occurred because an object of type `NoneType` does not have a length, causing the issue.
4. The GitHub issue highlights that the bug was introduced in a specific commit and suggests a solution to check if `self.columns` is not `None` before checking its length. This modification aligns with the suggested fix.

### Bug Cause:
The buggy function fails when trying to get the length of `self.columns` without checking if it is `None` first, leading to a `TypeError` when `self.columns` is `None`.

### Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we should check if `self.columns` is not `None` before attempting to get its length.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

By adding the `if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:` condition, we prevent the `TypeError` from occurring when `self.columns` is `None`. This correction aligns with the suggested fix in the GitHub issue and should resolve the bug.
