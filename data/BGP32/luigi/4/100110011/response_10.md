### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `copy` is part of the `RedshiftTarget` class in the `luigi/contrib/redshift.py` file.
2. The test function `test_s3_copy_with_nonetype_columns` in `test/contrib/redshift_test.py` is mocking the `RedshiftTarget` object and calling the `copy` function.
3. The error occurs when trying to check the length of `self.columns`, which is `None` in the test case, causing a `TypeError`.
4. The GitHub issue points out that explicitly checking if `self.columns` is not `None` before checking its length would resolve the issue.

### Bug Explanation:
The bug occurs when attempting to check the length of `self.columns` in the `copy` function, where `self.columns` is `None`. This triggers a `TypeError` because `NoneType` object does not support the `len()` operation.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to check if `self.columns` is not `None` before trying to get its length. This will prevent the `TypeError` from occurring.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

By adding the check for `self.columns` in the `if` condition, we ensure that only non-`None` values are processed for their length, avoiding the `TypeError` mentioned in the GitHub issue.
