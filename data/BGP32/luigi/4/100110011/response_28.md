## Analysis
The buggy function `copy` in `luigi/contrib/redshift.py` is failing because it is not handling the case where `self.columns` is `None`. This leads to a `TypeError` when trying to get the length of `self.columns`.

The failing test `test_s3_copy_with_nonetype_columns` is trying to test the behavior when `columns` is `None`, but the buggy function is not handling this scenario correctly.

The GitHub issue describes the same problem, where the `copy` function fails when `columns` is not provided.

## Bug Cause
The bug is caused by not checking if `self.columns` is `None` before attempting to get its length. When `columns` is `None`, the code tries to execute `len(None)`, leading to a `TypeError`.

## Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to modify the condition in the `copy` function to first check if `self.columns` is not `None` before checking its length.

## Corrected Version
Here is the corrected version of the `copy` function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:  # Check if self.columns is not None
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

By making this modification, the `copy` function will now handle the case when `columns` is `None` and prevent the `TypeError`. This corrected version should pass the failing test and resolve the issue reported on GitHub.
