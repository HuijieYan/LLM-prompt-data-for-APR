The buggy function `copy` in the `luigi/contrib/redshift.py` file is failing due to a `TypeError` caused by checking the length of `self.columns` when it is `None`.

- **Error Location**: The issue lies in the line `if len(self.columns) > 0:`, where it checks the length of `self.columns`.
- **Cause of the Bug**: The bug occurs because when `columns=None` is passed to the function, it results in a `NoneType` object for `self.columns`, which does not support the `len()` function.
- **Strategy for Fixing the Bug**: To fix the bug, we need to check if `self.columns` is not `None` before checking its length.

### Corrected Version of the `copy` function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns is not None and len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

By making this change in the `copy` function, it will prevent the `TypeError` when `columns=None` is passed to the function, and the corrected version should pass the failing test and resolve the GitHub issue.
