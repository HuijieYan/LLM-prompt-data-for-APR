### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `copy` in the `luigi/contrib/redshift.py` file is trying to determine the length of `self.columns` which is causing an error when `columns` is `None`.
   
2. The failing test `test_s3_copy_with_nonetype_columns` in the `test/contrib/redshift_test.py` file mocks a RedshiftTarget and tries to execute the `copy` method with `columns` set to `None`.

3. The error message indicates a `TypeError` due to trying to get the length of a `NoneType` object.

4. The GitHub issue highlights the specific problem when running Redshift COPY jobs with `columns = None`, suggesting a possible fix to check for `self.columns` before checking its length.

### Bug Explanation:
The bug occurs because the code directly tries to check the length of `self.columns` without explicitly handling the case when `self.columns` is `None`. This leads to a `TypeError` when trying to get the length of a `NoneType` object.

### Bug Fix:
To fix the bug, we can modify the condition to first check if `self.columns` is not `None` before trying to get its length.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns is not None and len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
``` 

By adding the conditional `if self.columns is not None and len(self.columns) > 0`, we ensure that the code will only try to get the length of `self.columns` if it is not `None`. This should prevent the `TypeError` and fix the issue reported in GitHub.
