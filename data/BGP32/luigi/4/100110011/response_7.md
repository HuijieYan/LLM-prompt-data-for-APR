### Analysis:
1. The `copy` function in the `luigi/contrib/redshift.py` file is failing because it is trying to get the length of `self.columns`, which is `None` in the provided test case.
2. The error message indicates that the code is trying to perform `len` operation on a `None` type object, resulting in a `TypeError`.
3. The GitHub issue also confirms that the bug occurs when `columns` are `None`, and the suggested solution is to check if `self.columns` exists before trying to get its length.
4. To fix the bug, we need to modify the condition checking for the existence of `self.columns` before getting its length.
5. The corrected version of the function will include this additional check to prevent the `TypeError`.

### Updated Version:
```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:  # Added check for existence of self.columns
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

By adding the additional check for `self.columns` before accessing its length, the function will now handle the case where `columns` are `None` without raising a `TypeError`. This correction should address the bug reported in the GitHub issue and allow the function to pass the failing test case.
