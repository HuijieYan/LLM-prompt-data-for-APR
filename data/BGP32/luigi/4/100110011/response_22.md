### Analysis:
1. The buggy function is a `copy` method within the `S3CopyToTable` class in `luigi/contrib/redshift.py` file.
2. The failing test `test_s3_copy_with_nonetype_columns` is part of `test/contrib/redshift_test.py`.
3. The error message indicates a `TypeError` due to trying to get the length of `self.columns` when it is `None`.
4. The issue on GitHub highlights the root cause and suggests a potential fix by checking if `self.columns` exists before checking its length.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is caused by not checking if `self.columns` is `None` before trying to get its length. This causes a `TypeError` when `self.columns` is `None`.

### Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to modify the condition checking for the length of `self.columns` to first ensure that `self.columns` is not `None`. This will prevent the `TypeError` when `self.columns` is `None`.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

After incorporating these changes, the `copy` function should now handle the case where `self.columns` is `None`, preventing the `TypeError` and resolving the bug.
