### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `copy` in `luigi/contrib/redshift.py` fails to handle the case when `self.columns` is `None`.
2. The test function `test_s3_copy_with_nonetype_columns` in `test/contrib/redshift_test.py` creates a task with `columns` as `None` and expects the `copy` method to execute without errors.
3. The error message indicates a `TypeError` caused by calling `len` on a `NoneType` object inside the `copy` method.
4. The GitHub issue points out that the bug was introduced in a specific pull request and suggests changing the condition to check for `self.columns` before calling `len`.

### Cause of the Bug:
The buggy function does not check if `self.columns` is `None` before trying to get its length using `len(self.columns)`. This results in a `TypeError` when `self.columns` is `None`.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to update the condition to first check if `self.columns` is not `None` before proceeding to check its length.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

By adding the check `if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0`, we ensure that the code only attempts to get the length of `self.columns` if it is not `None`. This correction will prevent the `TypeError` when `self.columns` is `None`.
