### Analysis:
1. The `copy` function in the `RedshiftTarget` class is failing when `self.columns` is `None` due to the comparison `len(self.columns) > 0`, which results in a `TypeError` since `NoneType` does not have a length.
2. The failing test `test_s3_copy_with_nonetype_columns` creates an instance of `DummyS3CopyToTableKey` with `columns=None` and then calls `task.run()`, which eventually calls the `copy` function passing `cursor` and `path`.
3. The error message indicates that the issue is at line 338 in `luigi/contrib/redshift.py` where `len(self.columns)` is being called when `self.columns` is `None`.
4. The GitHub issue explains that the bug was introduced in a specific commit and suggests a possible fix to handle the `None` case appropriately.
5. The strategy for fixing the bug would be to modify the condition where `len(self.columns)` is checked to also verify if `self.columns` is not `None` before checking its length.

### Correction:
```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:  # Check if self.columns is not None before checking length
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

By adding the check `if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0`, we ensure that the length is only checked when `self.columns` is not `None`, resolving the `TypeError` when `columns` is `None`. This correction aligns with the suggestion provided in the GitHub issue.
