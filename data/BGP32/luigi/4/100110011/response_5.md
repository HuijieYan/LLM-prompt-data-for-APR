### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `copy` in `luigi/contrib/redshift.py` is trying to check the length of `self.columns`, but it does not handle the case where `self.columns` is `None`.
2. The failing test `test_s3_copy_with_nonetype_columns` in `test/contrib/redshift_test.py` creates an instance of `DummyS3CopyToTableKey` with `columns=None`, causing the error during the execution of the `copy` function.
3. The error message indicates a `TypeError` due to trying to get the length of a `NoneType` object.
4. The GitHub issue points out the root cause being the missing handling of `self.columns` being `None`.
5. The suggested fix from the GitHub issue is to modify the condition to `if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0`.

### Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to modify the condition in the `copy` function to handle the case where `self.columns` is `None`. By adding a null check before checking the length, we can ensure that the function does not throw a `TypeError`.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:  # Add a null check for self.columns
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

By making this change, the corrected version of the `copy` function will handle the case where `self.columns` is `None` and prevent the `TypeError`.
