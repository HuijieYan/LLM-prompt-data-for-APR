### Issue Analysis:
The buggy function `copy` in `luigi/contrib/redshift.py` is failing due to the condition `if len(self.columns) > 0:` where `self.columns` can be `None`. This issue is triggered by the failing test `test_s3_copy_with_nonetype_columns` in `test/contrib/redshift_test.py`, resulting in a `TypeError`.

The error message from the failing test indicates that the `columns` attribute in `DummyS3CopyToTableKey` is `None`, causing the `copy` function to throw a `TypeError` when trying to get the length of `None`.

The related GitHub issue highlights that the bug surfaced in luigi 2.7.1 when `columns` are not provided, preventing table creation in Redshift. The proposed solution in the GitHub issue suggests modifying the condition to `if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:`.

### Bug Cause:
The bug occurs because the code does not handle the case where `self.columns` is `None`, leading to a `TypeError` when trying to determine its length. 

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, ensure that the `self.columns` attribute is checked for `None` before getting its length. By updating the condition to include this check, the bug can be resolved.

### Corrected Version of the Function `copy`:
```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:  # Check for None before getting the length
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
    COPY {table} {colnames} FROM '{source}'
    CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
    {options};
    """.format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

By incorporating the `self.columns` check for `None`, the corrected version of the `copy` function should pass the failing test and resolve the bug.
