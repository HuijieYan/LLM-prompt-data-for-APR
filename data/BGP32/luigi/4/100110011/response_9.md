### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `copy` tries to check the length of `self.columns`, and if it's greater than 0, it constructs a string `colnames`.
2. The failing test `test_s3_copy_with_nonetype_columns` creates a task `DummyS3CopyToTableKey` with `columns=None`, which leads to the error as `NoneType` has no length.
3. The error message indicates that the bug is in line 338 of `luigi/contrib/redshift.py`.
4. The GitHub issue highlights the same problem with a proposed solution to change the conditional check.

### Bug Cause:
The buggy function fails when trying to check the length of `self.columns` without validating if `self.columns` exists or not. Since `columns=None` was passed to the task in the failing test, it results in a `NoneType` error when checking its length in the `copy` function.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to update the conditional check to ensure `self.columns` is not `None` before attempting to get its length.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

By updating the conditional check in the `copy` function to verify if `self.columns` is not `None` before checking its length, we can prevent the `TypeError` when `columns=None` is passed. This corrected version should now pass the failing test and resolve the issue reported on GitHub.
