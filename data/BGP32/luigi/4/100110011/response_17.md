### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `copy` in `luigi/contrib/redshift.py` is causing an error due to the `if len(self.columns) > 0` check when `self.columns` is `None`.
2. The failing test `test_s3_copy_with_nonetype_columns` in `test/contrib/redshift_test.py` tries to run a task with `columns=None`, which results in the error.
3. The error message `TypeError: object of type 'NoneType' has no len()` clearly indicates that the program is trying to get the length of a `NoneType` object.
4. The GitHub issue highlights the bug when running Redshift COPY jobs with `columns=None` in `luigi 2.7.1`, suggesting a solution to modify the conditional check.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is caused by the conditional check `if len(self.columns) > 0` in the `copy` function. When `self.columns` is `None`, it raises a `TypeError` as `NoneType` objects do not have a length, hence causing the test to fail.

### Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we should update the conditional check to handle the case when `self.columns` is `None`. By adding a check for `self.columns` before checking its length, we can avoid the `TypeError` and enable the code to run smoothly.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.
    
    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

By incorporating the `if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0` check, we ensure that the code does not throw an error when `self.columns` is `None` and avoids the `TypeError`. This correction should resolve the bug and make the test `test_s3_copy_with_nonetype_columns` pass successfully.
