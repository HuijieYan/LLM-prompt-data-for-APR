### Bug Analysis:
1. The buggy function `copy` in `redshift.py` is trying to check the length of `self.columns`, which is set to `None` in the failing test case `test_s3_copy_with_nonetype_columns`.
2. The error occurs when it tries to check `if len(self.columns) > 0`, where `self.columns` is `None`, leading to a `TypeError`.
3. The failing test case is checking for the behavior when `columns` is `None` to prevent table creation, but the buggy function is not handling this case correctly.
4. The error message clearly indicates that it is a `TypeError` due to trying to get the length of a `NoneType` object.

### Bug Cause:
The bug occurs because the `copy` function is attempting to get the length of `self.columns` without checking if it is `None`. This leads to a `TypeError` when the function tries to perform operations on a `NoneType` object.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to add a check to ensure that `self.columns` is not `None` before trying to get its length. This will prevent the `TypeError` when `columns` is intentionally set to `None` to prevent table creation.

### Corrected Version of the `copy` function:
```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    
    if self.columns is not None and len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

By adding the check `if self.columns is not None and len(self.columns) > 0`, we ensure that the `copy` function will handle the case when `columns` is intentionally set to `None`. This corrected version should resolve the bug and make the function more robust.
