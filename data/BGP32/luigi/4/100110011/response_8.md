## Analysis:
1. The buggy function `copy` in the `luigi/contrib/redshift.py` file is responsible for copying data from S3 into Redshift. The bug arises when the `columns` attribute is set to `None`, causing a `TypeError` due to an attempt to get the length of a `NoneType` object.
2. The failing test `test_s3_copy_with_nonetype_columns` in `test/contrib/redshift_test.py` sets the `columns` attribute of the task to `None` and then triggers the `run` method, leading to the invocation of the `copy` method with `None` as the `columns` parameter.
3. The error message indicates that the bug occurs at line 338 in the `copy` method due to an attempt to check the length of `self.columns`, which is `None`.
4. Based on the information from the GitHub issue, the suggested fix is to modify the conditional check to `if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:` to handle the case where `self.columns` is `None`.
5. To fix the bug, we need to update the `copy` method to handle the scenario where `columns` is `None` without causing a `TypeError`.

## Corrected Version of the `copy` Function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from S3 into Redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

By updating the conditional check in the `copy` method to consider the case where `self.columns` is `None`, the corrected version of the function should now handle the scenario described in the failing test and the GitHub issue.
