### Analysis:
1. The provided buggy function `copy` in `luigi/contrib/redshift.py` is attempting to extract column names from `self.columns` and use them in a SQL `COPY` query. The issue lies in the comparison `if len(self.columns) > 0` where it throws a `TypeError` if `self.columns` is `None`.
   
2. The failing test `test_s3_copy_with_nonetype_columns` in `test/contrib/redshift_test.py` mocks the necessary objects and expects the `DummyS3CopyToTableKey` task to successfully run the `copy` method with `columns=None`, which triggers the `TypeError`.

3. The failing test provides the error message stating that 'object of type 'NoneType' has no len()', showing the specific point of failure in the `copy` function and the problematic comparison with `self.columns`.

4. The associated GitHub issue highlights the same problem where running `COPY` jobs with `columns=None` causes a failure due to the explicit check for the length of `self.columns`.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is caused by the explicit check `if len(self.columns) > 0` in the `copy` function, which results in a `TypeError` when `self.columns` is `None`. This check assumes `self.columns` will always be a list and doesn't accommodate the case when it might be `None`.

### Fix Strategy:
To fix this bug, the conditional statement should be modified to first check if `self.columns` is not `None` before comparing its length. This will prevent the `TypeError` when `self.columns` is `None`.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

By making the modification to check if `self.columns` is not `None` before trying to determine its length, the corrected version of the `copy` function should now handle the case where `columns` is `None` without raising a `TypeError`.
