### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `copy` is from the file `luigi/contrib/redshift.py`, responsible for inserting files from S3 into Redshift.
2. In the failing test `test_s3_copy_with_nonetype_columns` from `test/contrib/redshift_test.py`, a `DummyS3CopyToTableKey` task is created with `columns=None`.
3. The error occurs because there is an attempt to get the length of `self.columns`, which is `None`, hence resulting in a `TypeError`.
4. The provided GitHub issue identifies the root cause and suggests a possible solution to handle `self.columns` being `None`.

### Bug Cause:
The bug occurs in the `copy` function when trying to get the length of `self.columns`, which is `None`, leading to a `TypeError`. This issue was identified and reported in the GitHub issue mentioned.

### Bug Fix:
To fix the bug, modify the if condition to check if `self.columns` is not None before trying to get its length. This change will prevent the `TypeError` when `self.columns` is `None`.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:  # Fix: Check if self.columns is not None
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
``` 

By incorporating the fix above, the corrected version of the `copy` function should address the bug and allow the test `test_s3_copy_with_nonetype_columns` to pass successfully.
