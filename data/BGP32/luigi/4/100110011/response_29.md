### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `copy()` in the `luigi/contrib/redshift.py` file is failing due to the `TypeError: object of type 'NoneType' has no len()` error when trying to check the length of `self.columns`.
2. The failing test in `test/contrib/redshift_test.py` shows that the `DummyS3CopyToTableKey` task is being created with `columns=None`.
3. The error message points to line 338 in `luigi/contrib/redshift.py`, where the length of `self.columns` is being checked without handling the case where `self.columns` is `None`.
4. The GitHub issue suggests that the bug was introduced in luigi 2.7.1 and provides a possible solution to handle the case when `self.columns` is `None`.

### Bug Cause:
The bug occurs because the `copy()` function does not handle the case where `self.columns` is `None`, leading to a `TypeError` when trying to get the length of `None`.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to modify the condition checking the length of `self.columns` to also handle the case where `self.columns` is `None`. By adding an additional check for `self.columns` before checking its length, we can prevent the `TypeError` from occurring.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from S3 into Redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

By updating the `copy()` function to include the check `if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0`, we ensure that the function does not throw a `TypeError` when `self.columns` is `None`. This correction should resolve the issue and pass the failing test.
