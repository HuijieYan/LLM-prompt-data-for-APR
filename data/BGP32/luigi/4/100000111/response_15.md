### Analysis:
- The buggy function `copy` is failing when `self.columns` is set to `None`.
- The issue described in the GitHub problem is related to the failure of the Redshift COPY job when columns are not provided, resulting in the error `TypeError: object of type 'NoneType' has no len()`.
- The problem arises from the condition `if len(self.columns) > 0`, which throws an error when `self.columns` is `None`.
- The suggested solution in the GitHub issue proposes changing the condition to `if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0` to handle the case where `self.columns` is `None`.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
- To resolve this bug, we need to modify the condition checking the columns to handle the case where `self.columns` is `None`.
- By updating the condition to consider both `self.columns` and its length, we can prevent the TypeError when `self.columns` is `None`.

### Corrected Function:
```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

By updating the condition to check both `self.columns` and its length in the `if` statement, we ensure that the function does not throw a `TypeError` when `self.columns` is `None`.
