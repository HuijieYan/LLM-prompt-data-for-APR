### Bug Analysis:
1. The bug arises due to the `if len(self.columns) > 0:` line in the function, which causes an error when `self.columns` is None.
2. The GitHub issue specifies that Redshift COPY jobs fail when columns are not provided due to the TypeError caused by `NoneType` having no length.
3. The bug occurs because the code assumes `self.columns` to always have a value, leading to the TypeError issue.
4. To fix the bug, we need to check if `self.columns` is not None before attempting to access its length.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
- Update the code to include a check for `self.columns` being not None before assessing its length to prevent the TypeError issue.

### Corrected Function:
```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:  # Check if columns exist and have a length
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

By adding the check `if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0`, we ensure that the code only attempts to access the length of `self.columns` when it contains actual values, resolving the TypeError issue reported in the GitHub problem.
