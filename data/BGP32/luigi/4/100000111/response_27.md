Potential error location: The buggy function's problematic area is in the if statement that checks the length of `self.columns`.

Cause of the bug: The bug occurs because the buggy function does not handle the case where `self.columns` is None. When `self.columns` is None, the buggy function tries to call len() on a NoneType object, which raises a TypeError. 

Strategy for fixing the bug: To fix the bug, we need to check if `self.columns` is not None before checking its length in the if statement.

## Corrected version of the function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

By adding the condition `if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:`, we ensure that the buggy function only attempts to get the length of `self.columns` when it is not None. This correction addresses the issue mentioned in the GitHub bug report and handles the case where `self.columns` is None.
