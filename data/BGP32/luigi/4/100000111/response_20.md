Based on the provided information, the issue stems from the condition `if len(self.columns) > 0` in the `copy` function, which causes an error when `columns` is `None`. To fix this issue, we need to update the condition to `if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0` to check if `columns` is not `None` before applying the `len` function.

Here is the corrected version of the `copy` function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.
    
    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

By adding the condition `if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0`, we ensure that the `colnames` variable is only constructed if `columns` is not `None`. This change will prevent the `TypeError` when `columns` is `None` and address the GitHub issue related to Redshift COPY failures when columns are not provided.
