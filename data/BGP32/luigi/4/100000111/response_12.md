### Analysis:
The buggy function `copy` is failing when the `columns` attribute of the `self` object is `None`. This leads to a `TypeError` because the length of `None` cannot be calculated in the following line:
```python
if len(self.columns) > 0:
```
The GitHub issue suggests changing this line to:
```python
if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:
```
This change will ensure that the `len` operation is only attempted when `self.columns` is not `None`.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Check if `self.columns` is not `None` before calculating its length.
2. Apply the suggested change from the GitHub issue to prevent `TypeError`.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:  # Check if self.columns is not None
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
``` 

By incorporating the suggested change, the `copy` function should now work correctly and handle cases where `self.columns` is `None`.
