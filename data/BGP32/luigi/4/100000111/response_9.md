### Analysis:
The buggy function `copy` is failing due to the check on the `self.columns` attribute. When `self.columns` is set to `None`, the buggy function tries to get the length of `None`, resulting in the error mentioned in the GitHub issue.

### Error Location:
The error is occurring when trying to get the length of `self.columns` in the line:
```python
if len(self.columns) > 0:
```

### Cause of the Bug:
The bug is caused by the assumption that `self.columns` will always be a list. When `self.columns` is set to `None`, attempting to get the length of `None` raises an exception. This behavior is consistent with the GitHub issue's description where passing `columns = None` is meant to prohibit table creation but throws an error.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix this bug, we will modify the condition to handle the case where `self.columns` is `None` explicitly. By checking if `self.columns` is not `None` before getting its length, we can avoid the TypeError.

### Corrected Version:
```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: luigi/contrib/redshift.py

def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

By checking `if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0`, we ensure that `self.columns` is not `None` before attempting to get its length. This modification addresses the bug and aligns with the suggested solution in the GitHub issue.
