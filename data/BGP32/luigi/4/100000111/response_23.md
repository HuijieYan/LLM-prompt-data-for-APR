## Analysis
The buggy function `copy` in the `redshift.py` file of the `luigi/contrib` module fails to handle the case where `self.columns` is `None`. This leads to a `TypeError` when trying to get the length of `self.columns`.

## Potential Error Location
The potential error location in the buggy function is the following line:
```python
if len(self.columns) > 0:
```

## Cause of the Bug
The bug is caused by assuming that `self.columns` is always a list and trying to get its length directly without considering the possibility of it being `None`. This leads to a `TypeError` when `self.columns` is `None`.

## Strategy for Fixing the Bug
To fix the bug, the code should first check if `self.columns` is not `None` before trying to retrieve its length. This will prevent the `TypeError` when `self.columns` is `None`.

## Corrected Version of the Function
```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

In the corrected version of the function, it first checks if `self.columns` is not `None` before trying to get its length. This fixes the issue reported in the GitHub bug where the Redshift COPY job fails when columns are not provided.
