### Analysis:
The buggy function `copy` is failing when `self.columns` is `None` and an attempt is made to get its length `len(self.columns)`. This issue is causing the `TypeError: object of type 'NoneType' has no len()` error, as reported on the GitHub issue.

### Error Location:
The potential error location within the buggy function is the condition checking the length of `self.columns`.

### Cause of the Bug:
The bug arises from the assumption that `self.columns` will always be a non-empty list. When `self.columns` is `None`, the code attempts to get the length of `None`, leading to the mentioned `TypeError`.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to add a check to ensure that `self.columns` is not `None` before attempting to get its length. This will prevent the `TypeError` from occurring and ensure that the function can handle cases where `self.columns` is not provided.

### Corrected Function:
```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

By adding the `if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:` check before processing `colnames`, we ensure that the buggy function can handle cases where `self.columns` is `None` without causing a `TypeError`. This correction addresses the issue reported in the GitHub bug report.
