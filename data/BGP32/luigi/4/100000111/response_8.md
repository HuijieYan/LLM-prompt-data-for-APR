### Analysis:
The buggy function is a `copy` method within the `DummyS3CopyToTableKey` class in the `luigi/contrib/redshift.py` file. The function is responsible for defining copying data from S3 into Redshift. The bug seems to occur when the `self.columns` attribute is `None`, leading to a `TypeError: object of type 'NoneType' has no len()` error.

### Error Location:
The potential error location is in the following lines:
```python
if len(self.columns) > 0:
```
Here, the code assumes `self.columns` is always going to be a valid iterable, which leads to the error when it is `None`.

### Bug Cause:
The bug causes the code to attempt to get the length of `None`, resulting in a `TypeError`. The GitHub issue confirms that the bug arises when `self.columns` is `None` and suggests changing the conditional check.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we should explicitly check if `self.columns` is not `None` before checking its length to avoid the `TypeError`.
We can modify the conditional check to:
```python
if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:
```
This change ensures that `len(self.columns)` is only calculated when `self.columns` is not `None`.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

By making this change in the conditional check, the function will handle cases where `self.columns` is `None` gracefully, as suggested in the GitHub issue, and prevent the `TypeError`.
