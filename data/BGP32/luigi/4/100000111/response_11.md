### Analysis:
The buggy function `copy` in the `luigi/contrib/redshift.py` file is trying to execute a copy command in Redshift, but there is a bug related to the `self.columns` attribute. The bug causes an issue when `self.columns` is `None`.

The GitHub issue mentioned that running Redshift COPY jobs with `columns = None` to prohibit table creation fails in luigi 2.7.1 with a `TypeError: object of type 'NoneType' has no len()`. The bug lies in the condition where `self.columns` is being checked for its length without verifying if it is `None` first.

### Bug Cause:
The bug occurs because the code assumes `self.columns` to always have a list of columns. When `self.columns` is `None`, it causes an error when the code tries to get the length of a `NoneType` object.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, the code needs to check if `self.columns` is not `None` before checking its length. By ensuring that `self.columns` is not `None` before attempting to get its length, the bug can be resolved.

### Corrected Version:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

By incorporating the check `if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:` before handling the `colnames` logic, the bug related to `NoneType` has been mitigated. Now, the function will only check the length of `self.columns` if it is not `None`, resolving the issue reported in the GitHub problem statement.
