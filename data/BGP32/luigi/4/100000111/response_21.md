### Analysis:
The buggy function `copy` is failing due to an issue when checking the length of `self.columns`, which results in a `TypeError` when it is `None`. The GitHub issue states that running Redshift COPY jobs with `columns = None` to prohibit table creation fails in luigi 2.7.1.

### Error Location:
The error is occurring when checking the length of `self.columns` in the conditional statement `if len(self.columns) > 0`. When `self.columns` is `None`, this results in a `TypeError`.

### Cause of the Bug:
The bug arises from the assumption that `self.columns` will always be a list, leading to the error when it is `None`. This issue was brought up in the GitHub discussion linked to the problem.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, the condition should be modified to first check if `self.columns` is not `None` before attempting to get its length.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

By adding the condition `if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0`, we ensure that `self.columns` is not `None` before checking its length, resolving the `TypeError` issue when `columns = None`. This corrected version satisfies the expected inputs/outputs and resolves the reported GitHub issue related to the bug.
