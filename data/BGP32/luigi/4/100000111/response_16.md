### Analysis
The buggy function `copy` is failing due to the condition `if len(self.columns) > 0:` causing an error when `self.columns` is `None`. This is in line with the GitHub issue which states that running Redshift COPY jobs with columns set to `None` fails in luigi 2.7.1.

### Potential Error Locations
The potential error location is in the `if len(self.columns) > 0:` condition where `self.columns` can be `None`.

### Cause of the Bug
The bug is caused by assuming `self.columns` will always have a value and trying to calculate its length when it can be `None`. This leads to a `TypeError` when trying to call `len(None)`.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug
To fix the bug, we need to modify the condition to check if `self.columns` exists and has a value before trying to calculate its length. This will prevent the `TypeError` when `self.columns` is `None`.

### Corrected Version of the Function
```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

By adding the condition `if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:` we ensure that the code only attempts to calculate the length of `self.columns` when it is not `None`. This corrected version should now handle cases where `self.columns` is `None` as described in the GitHub issue.
