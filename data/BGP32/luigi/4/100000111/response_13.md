### Analysis
- The buggy function `copy` is failing when `self.columns` is not provided because it tries to access the length of `self.columns` without checking if it is `None` or not.
- The GitHub issue indicates that providing a solution to handle the case when `self.columns` is `None` will fix the bug.
- The expected input `DummyS3CopyToTableKey` object has `columns` set to `None`, triggering the bug.
- The fix involves checking if `self.columns` is not `None` before trying to access its length.

### Bug Cause
- The bug is caused by directly accessing the length of `self.columns` without checking if it is `None`.
- When `self.columns` is `None`, trying to access its length raises a `TypeError`.

### Fix Strategy
- Check if `self.columns` is not `None` before trying to access its length to avoid the `TypeError`.
- If `self.columns` is provided, proceed with constructing `colnames` accordingly.

### Corrected Function
```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    col_names = ''
    if self.columns is not None:
        col_names = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        col_names = '({})'.format(col_names)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {col_names} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        col_names=col_names,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

The corrected version of the function will now check if `self.columns` is not `None` before constructing `col_names`. This change will prevent the `TypeError` when `self.columns` is `None`, addressing the GitHub issue related to failures when columns are not provided.
