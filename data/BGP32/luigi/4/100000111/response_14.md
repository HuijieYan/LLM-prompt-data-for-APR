### Analysis:
The buggy function `copy` in `luigi/contrib/redshift.py` is failing when the `self.columns` attribute is `None`, causing a `TypeError` due to trying to get the length of a `NoneType`. This issue is described in the GitHub issue as failing when columns are not provided explicitly. The proposed solution is to check if `self.columns` is not `None` before attempting to get its length.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is caused by assuming that `self.columns` will always have a value when trying to retrieve its length. When `self.columns` is `None`, the program crashes with a `TypeError`. This is due to not handling the case where `self.columns` is `None`.

### Bug Fix:
To fix the bug, we need to check if `self.columns` is not `None` before attempting to use it to construct the `colnames` variable.

### Corrected Version:
```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: luigi/contrib/redshift.py

def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:  # Check if self.columns is not None before using it
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

By adding the check `if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0`, we ensure that the code only tries to construct `colnames` if `self.columns` is not `None`. This correction should address the issue described in the GitHub bug report and prevent the `TypeError` when columns are not provided explicitly.
