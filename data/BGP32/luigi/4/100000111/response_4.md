### Analysis:
The buggy function is failing to handle the case when `self.columns` is `None`, causing the error `TypeError: object of type 'NoneType' has no len()`. The GitHub issue associated with this bug points out that the problem arises when columns are not provided.

### Issues:
1. The buggy function does not check if `self.columns` is None before attempting to access its length.
2. The error occurs due to the assumption that `self.columns` will always have a valid list of columns.

### Cause of the Bug:
The buggy function assumes that `self.columns` will always have a list of columns to construct `colnames`. When `self.columns` is None, it results in a `TypeError` when trying to access its length.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to implement a check to handle the case when `self.columns` is None before constructing `colnames`.

### Corrected Version of the Function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

By adding the check `if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:`, we ensure that `colnames` is constructed only when `self.columns` is not None. This correction will prevent the `TypeError` when columns are not provided, fixing the bug.
