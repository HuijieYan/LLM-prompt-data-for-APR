### Analyzing the buggy function

The buggy function is a copy function that copies data from s3 into Redshift. The issue arises when the `self.columns` parameter is not provided (set to `None`). The bug causes a `TypeError` due to trying to get the length of a `NoneType` object, leading to a failure in the copying process.

### Identifying potential error locations

The error in the function can be identified in the line where the length of `self.columns` is checked without verifying if `self.columns` is not None.

### Cause of the bug

The bug occurs because the function does not check if `self.columns` is None before trying to get its length. When `self.columns` is set to `None` to prohibit table creation, the length check causes a `TypeError` since `None` does not have a length property.

### Strategy for fixing the bug

To fix the bug, we should first check if `self.columns` is not None before proceeding to get its length. By adding this check, we can prevent the `TypeError` from occurring when `self.columns` is set to `None`.

### Corrected version of the function

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

In the corrected version, we added a check `if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0` before processing the columns to ensure that `self.columns` is not `None` before attempting to get its length. This modification will prevent the `TypeError` when `self.columns` is None, resolving the bug described in the GitHub issue.
