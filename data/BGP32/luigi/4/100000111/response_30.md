The bug in the provided function arises from the condition `len(self.columns) > 0` where if `self.columns` is `None`, it results in a `TypeError: object of type 'NoneType' has no len()` as pointed out in the GitHub issue. In the case where `self.columns` is `None`, the buggy function does not handle this scenario properly, causing the error.

To fix this bug, we can modify the condition to check if `self.columns` is not `None` before checking its length. This change will ensure that the function handles the case where `self.columns` is `None` correctly.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.
    
    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

This corrected version of the function includes the modification to the condition `if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0` to properly handle the case where `self.columns` is `None`. This change addresses the bug reported in the GitHub issue and ensures that the function works as expected for all scenarios.
