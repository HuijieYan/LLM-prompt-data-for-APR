### Issue Analysis:
The bug in the `copy` function arises due to the `len(self.columns)` check without verifying if `self.columns` is not `None`. This causes an exception when `self.columns` is set to `None`, leading to a `TypeError`. The expectation is to allow `self.columns` to be `None` while still functioning correctly.

### Bug Location:
The bug is located in the following line:
```python
if len(self.columns) > 0:
```

### Bug Cause:
The bug is caused by not checking if `self.columns` is not `None` before attempting to get the length of `self.columns`. When `self.columns` is `None`, trying to get the length of it results in a `TypeError`.

### Fix Strategy:
To resolve this bug, we need to ensure that `self.columns` is not `None` before checking its length. This can be achieved by modifying the condition to `if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:`. This modification will prevent the `TypeError` when `self.columns` is `None`.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

By making this change, the `copy` function will now properly handle cases where `self.columns` is `None` and prevent the `TypeError` reported in the GitHub issue.
