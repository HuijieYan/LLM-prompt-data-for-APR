### Analysis:
- The bug occurs in the `copy` function when the `self.columns` attribute is None, causing an error when trying to access the length of None.
- The bug is related to a GitHub issue where Redshift COPY jobs fail when `columns` are not provided due to a TypeError.
- The proposed solution in the GitHub issue suggests changing the condition to check if `self.columns` is not None before accessing its length.

### Bug Explanation:
- The bug occurs because the code directly checks the length of `self.columns` without verifying if it is None or not. When `self.columns` is None, trying to access its length results in a TypeError.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
- Modify the code to first check if `self.columns` is not None before trying to access its length. This will prevent the TypeError when `columns` are not provided.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

By adding the condition `if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0`, we ensure that the code only tries to access the length of `self.columns` if it is not None. This fix addresses the bug identified in the GitHub issue and prevents the TypeError when `columns` are not provided.
