## Analyzing the buggy function and the GitHub issue

The buggy function `copy` in the `luigi/contrib/redshift.py` file is failing when the `self.columns` attribute is set to `None`. The issue reported on GitHub highlights that the bug occurs due to an attempt to get the length of `self.columns` directly without checking if it is not `None` first.

The expected behavior is to allow the `self.columns` attribute to be `None` and avoid the TypeError when trying to determine its length.

## Bug Fix Strategy

To fix the bug, we need to modify the condition for checking the length of `self.columns`. We should first check if `self.columns` is not `None` before proceeding to get its length.

## Code Correction

```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: luigi/contrib/redshift.py

# The corrected function
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
``` 

By changing the condition to `if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0`, we ensure that we only attempt to get the length of `self.columns` if it is not `None`. This modification addresses the reported bug and avoids the TypeError when `self.columns` is `None`.
