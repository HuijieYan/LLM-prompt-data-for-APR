### Analysis:
The issue reported on GitHub indicates that when the `self.columns` attribute is set to `None` in the `DummyS3CopyToTableKey` class, the `copy` function fails due to a `TypeError` when trying to get the length of `self.columns`. The proposed solution is to modify the condition to `if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0` which ensures that the length check is performed only when `self.columns` is not `None`.

### Bugs:
1. The code directly attempts to get the length of `self.columns` without checking if it is `None`, leading to a `TypeError` when `self.columns` is `None`.
2. The `copy` function assumes that `self.columns` is always a list of tuples, which may not be the case when it is set to `None`.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Check if `self.columns` is not `None` before trying to get its length.
2. Handle the case where `self.columns` is `None` gracefully.

### Updated Corrected Version:
```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns is not None and len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

By incorporating the suggested changes, the corrected version of the `copy` function now checks if `self.columns` is not `None` before attempting to get its length, ensuring that it handles the case when `self.columns` is `None` gracefully.
