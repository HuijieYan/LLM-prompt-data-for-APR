### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `copy` in the `S3CopyToTable` class is responsible for copying data from an S3 bucket to a Redshift table.
2. The bug seems to be related to the way the `copy_options` function is used within the `cursor.execute` call in the `copy` function.
3. The failing test `test_s3_copy_with_nonetype_columns` is checking if the correct SQL query is generated when calling the `copy` function.
4. The bug might be caused by not properly calling the `copy_options` function within the `cursor.execute` call.
5. The buggy function should be fixed to correctly call and include the return value of `copy_options` in the SQL query string.


### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
1. Update the `copy` function to correctly call the `copy_options` function and include its return value in the SQL query string.
2. Ensure that the SQL query string is formatted with correct placeholders for table name, column names, source, credentials, and options.


### Corrected Version:
```python
    def copy(self, cursor, f):
        """
        Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

        If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
        """
        logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
        colnames = ''
        if self.columns is not None and len(self.columns) > 0:
            colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
            colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

        cursor.execute("""
         COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
         CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
         {options}
         ;""".format(
            table=self.table,
            colnames=colnames,
            source=f,
            creds=self._credentials(),
            options=self.copy_options())
        )
```

By making these changes, the corrected `copy` function will correctly call the `copy_options` function and include its return value in the SQL query string. This should fix the bug and make the test `test_s3_copy_with_nonetype_columns` pass.
