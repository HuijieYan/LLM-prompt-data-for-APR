### Analysis:
- The buggy function `copy` in the class `S3CopyToTable` is responsible for defining the copying operation from s3 into Redshift.
- The function uses string formatting to construct a SQL query for copying data, including table name, column names, source path, credentials, and additional options.
- The issue seems to be with the `options` part of the SQL query where `self.copy_options`, a method reference, should be called to get the options string. However, it is missing the `()` to actually call the method.
- This mistake prevents the `copy_options` method from being executed and the necessary options for the `COPY` statement are not included in the query.
- As a result, the test `test_s3_copy_with_nonetype_columns` fails because the expected SQL query does not match the actual query executed in the `copy` function.

### Bug:
The bug lies in the line:
```python
options=self.copy_options)
```
It should be:
```python
options=self.copy_options())
```

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to make sure that the `copy_options` method is actually called by appending `()` after the method name in the `copy` function.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options())
    )
``` 

After applying this correction, the `copy` function should now correctly call the `copy_options` method to get the necessary options for the `COPY` statement. This will ensure that the test `test_s3_copy_with_nonetype_columns` passes as expected.
