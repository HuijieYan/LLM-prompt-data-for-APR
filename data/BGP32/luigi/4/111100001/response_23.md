### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `copy` within the `S3CopyToTable` class in the `luigi.contrib.redshift.py` file is responsible for defining the copying process from S3 into Redshift.
2. The buggy function prepares and executes a `COPY` statement using attributes like `table`, `columns`, `source`, `creds`, and `options`. However, there are potential issues in constructing the `COPY` statement and executing it.
3. The failing test `test_s3_copy_with_nonetype_columns` creates a dummy task `DummyS3CopyToTableKey` with `columns` set to `None` and expects the `COPY` statement to be executed with specific parameters.
4. The bug seems to be in how the `copy_options` function is being used within the `copy` function. The `copy_options` function should be called to get the correct options for the `COPY` statement.
   
### Bug Cause:
The buggy function does not call the `copy_options` function correctly in constructing the `COPY` statement. The `copy_options` function is not being invoked with parentheses, leading to incorrect assignment in the `execute` statement.

### Bug Fix:
To fix the bug, the `copy_options` function needs to be called correctly, and the options returned should be inserted into the `COPY` statement. Also, the `colsames` assignment should be handled properly for cases where `self.columns` is empty.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options())
    )
```

By making these changes and correctly calling the `copy_options` function within the `execute` method, the bug should be resolved, and the corrected version should pass the failing test.
