### Analysis:
The buggy function `copy` in the `S3CopyToTable` class of `luigi.contrib.redshift.py` is supposed to define the copying process from S3 into Redshift. The bug seems to be in how the `copy_options` method is being used in the `cursor.execute` method call. The missing parentheses after `self.copy_options` indicate that the function is not being called properly.

### Issue:
The buggy function is not calling the `copy_options` method correctly, resulting in missing configurations for the copy operation in Redshift.

### Strategy for fixing the bug:
1. Ensure that the `copy_options` method is properly called to provide necessary configurations.
2. Check if the credentials are correctly generated by the `_credentials` method.
3. Update the `cursor.execute` call to include the correct configurations for the `COPY` operation.

### Corrected version of the `copy` function:
```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options())
    )
```

By adding parentheses `()` after `self.copy_options`, we are properly invoking the `copy_options` method to provide the required configurations for the `COPY` operation in Redshift. This correction should fix the bug and ensure that the function works correctly according to its intended functionality.
