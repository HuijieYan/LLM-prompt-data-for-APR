### Bug Analysis:
1. The buggy function `copy` is attempting to execute a SQL `COPY` statement to copy data from s3 into Redshift.
2. The bug seems to be related to the usage of `self.copy_options` in the SQL query string without actually calling the `copy_options` function.
3. Since `self.copy_options` is a function, it needs to be called as a method to retrieve the result before formatting it into the SQL query.
4. In the failing test, the `columns` attribute of the task is `None`, so the `colnames` variable should be empty.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Call the `self.copy_options()` method to retrieve the actual copy options string.
2. Make sure that the `colnames` variable is empty when the `columns` attribute is `None`.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options())
    )
```

By making these changes, the function should now correctly execute the `COPY` statement and pass the failing test.
