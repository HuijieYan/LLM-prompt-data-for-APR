## Analysis:
- The buggy function `copy()` within the `S3CopyToTable` class is responsible for copying data from S3 into Redshift.
- The buggy function is failing due to the incorrect handling of the `copy_options` function.
- The `copy_options` function is intended to return a string of copy options but is not being called correctly in the `copy` function.
- The SQL query being executed in the `copy` function is missing the execution of the `copy_options` function and is not interpolating the returned value correctly.

## Bug Cause:
- The bug is caused by not invoking the `copy_options` function correctly in the SQL query string in the `copy` function.
- The `copy_options` function should be called like a method by using `self.copy_options()` but it is currently being passed as a reference without invoking it.

## Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
1. Invoke the `copy_options` function correctly in the SQL query string by calling it as `self.copy_options()`.
2. Ensure that the returned string from the `copy_options` function is correctly interpolated within the SQL query.

## Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
    def copy(self, cursor, f):
        """
        Defines copying from S3 into Redshift.
        
        If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
        """
        logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
        colnames = ''
        if len(self.columns) > 0:
            colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
            colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)
        
        cursor.execute("""
         COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
         CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
         {options}
         ;""".format(
            table=self.table,
            colnames=colnames,
            source=f,
            creds=self._credentials(),
            options=self.copy_options())
        )
```

With this correction, the `copy` function should now correctly handle the execution of the `copy_options` function and interpolate the returned string within the SQL query.
