### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `copy` is responsible for executing a `COPY` query to copy data from an S3 location to a Redshift table.
2. The function constructs the `COPY` query string using the provided attributes like `table`, `columns`, `source`, and `credentials`.
3. The bug seems to be related to how `copy_options` function is used within the `COPY` query construction in the `cursor.execute` call.
4. The `copy_options` function seems to be a necessary part of constructing the `COPY` query correctly.
5. The failing test is testing a scenario where the `columns` attribute is `None` which may cause issues in constructing the `colnames` part of the `COPY` query.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is likely caused by how the `copy_options` function is being used in the `cursor.execute` call. If `copy_options` returns any options needed for the `COPY` command, they are missing in the query construction.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
1. Ensure that the `copy_options` provides the necessary options for the `COPY` command.
2. Handle the scenario when `columns` attribute is `None`.
3. Correctly handle the construction of the `colnames` part of the `COPY` query.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    options = self.copy_options()  # Calling the copy_options to get any additional options

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=options)  # Using options obtained from copy_options
    )
```

In the corrected version, `copy_options` is called to get any additional options needed for the `COPY` command. Additionally, it handles the scenario when `columns` attribute is `None` correctly.
