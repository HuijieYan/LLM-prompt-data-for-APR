## Analysis:
1. The buggy function `copy(self, cursor, f)` is responsible for copying data from an S3 source to a Redshift table in the `S3CopyToTable` class.
2. The function constructs a SQL `COPY` query using provided attributes like table, columns, source path, credentials, and copy options.
3. The bug seems to be in the way the `copy_options` function is called within the format string of the `cursor.execute` statement.
4. The failing test `test_s3_copy_with_nonetype_columns` checks if the SQL query is constructed correctly and executed with the expected parameters.

## Bug Cause:
- The bug is caused by passing the `copy_options` function reference (`self.copy_options`) without calling it, leading to incorrect SQL query construction.

## Bug Fix Strategy:
- Modify the way `copy_options` function is called within the `cursor.execute` statement to ensure its output is included in the query.
- Ensure that the `colnames` and other attributes are properly formatted and concatenated in the SQL query string.

## Corrected Version:
```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)
    
    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options())
    )
```

By including `()` after `self.copy_options`, we ensure that the function is called at the correct location within the `cursor.execute` statement, fixing the bug in the code.
