### Analysis:
1. The `copy` function in the `S3CopyToTable` class is supposed to define copying data from S3 into Redshift.
2. The buggy function is incorrectly constructing the SQL query for the `COPY` command by not calling the `copy_options` function correctly.
3. The bug is causing the test `test_s3_copy_with_nonetype_columns` to fail because the constructed SQL query does not include the copy options.
4. The correct strategy for fixing the bug is to call the `copy_options` function to get the copy options string and include it in the SQL query.
5. Below is the corrected version of the `copy` function:

### Corrected Version:
```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options())
    )
```

By calling `self.copy_options()` instead of `self.copy_options`, the function will correctly include the copy options in the `COPY` command SQL query. This correction should make the test `test_s3_copy_with_nonetype_columns` pass successfully.
