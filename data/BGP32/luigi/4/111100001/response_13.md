### Analysis:
- The buggy function `copy` in the `S3CopyToTable` class of the `redshift.py` file is responsible for defining the copying operation from S3 into Redshift.
- The function constructs and executes a SQL `COPY` statement to load data into Redshift from S3 using the provided credentials, table name, column names, and load path.
- The function makes use of `copy_options` method and `_credentials` method within its SQL statement construction.
- The failing test `test_s3_copy_with_nonetype_columns` in `redshift_test.py` tests the behavior of `S3CopyToTable` when the `columns` attribute is `None`.

### Bug:
- The bug in the `copy` function lies in how the `copy_options` method is called within the `cursor.execute()` statement. The `copy_options` method is not being called as a function.
- The `copy` function is currently passing `self.copy_options` as a function object, rather than calling `self.copy_options()` to get the actual options string.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
- Modify the `cursor.execute()` statement in the `copy` function to call the `copy_options` method as a function by adding `()` to it.
- This will ensure that the `copy_options` method is actually executed and its return value is included in the SQL `COPY` statement.
- Update the `{options}` placeholder in the SQL string with the correct call to `copy_options()`.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options())  # Call copy_options as a function
    )

```

By making the above correction, the `copy` function should now correctly call the `copy_options` method within the SQL statement, ensuring that the options are properly included in the `COPY` operation.
