### Analysis:
The buggy function `copy` in the `S3CopyToTable` class is supposed to define how data is copied from S3 into Redshift. The main issue in this function is that `self.copy_options` is not being properly called. It should be a function call `self.copy_options()`, but it is being treated as an attribute in the string formatting.

### Bug:
The bug in the `copy` function is caused by not calling `self.copy_options()` function to get the options for the `COPY` statement. This results in missing copy options when executing the SQL query.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
1. Correctly call the `copy_options` function to get the options for the `COPY` statement.
2. Ensure that the `copy_options` function returns the necessary options as a string.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options())
    )
```

Now, by calling `self.copy_options()` instead of `self.copy_options` in the `COPY` statement, the function will correctly include the copy options in the SQL query.
