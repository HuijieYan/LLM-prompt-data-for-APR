### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `copy` in the class `S3CopyToTable` is responsible for executing a `COPY` command in Redshift from an S3 source.
2. The function constructs a SQL query based on the attributes of the class instance (`self.table`, `self.columns`, `self._credentials()`, etc.).
3. The bug seems to be in the way the `copy_options` method is being used within the `format` string interpolation. The `copy_options` method is simply referenced without calling it as a function.
4. The code should be modified to call the `copy_options` method to get the actual options string.
5. This bug causes the failing test scenario `test_s3_copy_with_nonetype_columns` to fail.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is caused by directly referencing the `copy_options` method without calling it. This results in the `options=self.copy_options` part of the query being set to the method reference instead of the result of the method.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
Modify the code to call the `copy_options` method within the `format` method to get the actual options string for the `COPY` command.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options())  # Call the copy_options method
    )
```

By making this change, the `copy` function will now properly call the `copy_options` method to get the correct options string for the `COPY` command. This should fix the bug and make the failing test scenario pass.
