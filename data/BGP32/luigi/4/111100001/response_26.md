### Analysis:
1. The `S3CopyToTable` class is a template task for inserting a dataset into Redshift from S3. 
2. The `copy` method within the class is responsible for defining the copying process from S3 into Redshift.
3. The bug seems to be in the way the `copy` method constructs the SQL query. There are issues with the placeholder formatting and calling the `copy_options` function.
4. The failing test `test_s3_copy_with_nonetype_columns` creates a `DummyS3CopyToTableKey` task with `columns=None` and expects a specific SQL query to be executed using a mocked cursor.
5. The bug can be fixed by properly formatting the SQL query and calling the `copy_options` function correctly.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Ensure correct placeholder formatting for `table`, `colnames`, `source`, and `creds`.
2. Modify the way `colnames` are constructed when there are no columns.
3. Call the `copy_options` function with parentheses to get the result string.
4. Adjust the placeholders in the SQL query string and populate them with correct values.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options())
    )
```

By making these adjustments, the corrected version of the `copy` method should now correctly format the SQL query and execute it as expected, passing the failing test.
