### Analysis:
1. The `copy` function in the `S3CopyToTable` class is responsible for inserting data from S3 into Redshift. It constructs a SQL `COPY` statement using attributes like `table`, `columns`, `source`, and `creds`.
2. The bug seems to be related to how the `colnames` variable is constructed and used in the SQL statement. It is not handling the case where `self.columns` is None properly.
3. The failing test is trying to verify that the constructed SQL statement matches the expected SQL statement. Since `columns` is None in the test, the `colnames` should be empty.
4. The bug can be fixed by checking if `self.columns` is not None before constructing `colnames` and handling the case where it is None properly.

### Bug Fix:
Here is the corrected version of the `copy` function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options())
    )
```

In the corrected version:
- We check if `self.columns` is not None before constructing `colnames` to avoid the bug.
- We call `self.copy_options()` to properly fetch the copy options.
- This fix ensures that the SQL statement is constructed correctly even when `columns` is None.

The corrected version should pass the failing test `test_s3_copy_with_nonetype_columns`.
