### Analysis:
- The buggy function `S3CopyToTable.copy` is responsible for copying data from S3 into Redshift.
- The function constructs a SQL query using the values from the class attributes and executes it using the cursor.
- The bug seems to be related to the `colnames` variable, which is supposed to contain a comma-separated list of column names.
- The `copy_options` function is expected to be a separate method available in the class but it is not correctly used.
- The test `test_s3_copy_with_nonetype_columns` checks if the correct SQL query is being constructed for copying data.

### Bug Cause:
- The bug is caused by not actually calling the `copy_options` function to retrieve the options for the `COPY` statement.
- The `options=self.copy_options` line in the `cursor.execute` call should be `options=self.copy_options()`, indicating that `copy_options` is a function to be invoked.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
- We should call the `copy_options` function to get the options for the `COPY` statement.
- Modify the line in the `cursor.execute` call from `options=self.copy_options` to `options=self.copy_options()`.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options())  # Call the copy_options function
    )

```

By making the above correction, the bug should be fixed, and the corrected version of the function should now pass the failing test.
