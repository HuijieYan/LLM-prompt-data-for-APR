### Analysis:
The buggy function `copy` in the `S3CopyToTable` class is responsible for copying data from S3 to Redshift. The function constructs a SQL query using the provided attributes like table name, column names, source file path, credentials, and copy options. However, there are a few issues in the implementation that are causing the function to fail the test.

### Identified Issues:
1. The `copy_options` function is not being called correctly. It is a method of the class and should be invoked using `self.copy_options()` instead.
2. The `colnames` variable is not being properly formatted when constructing the SQL query.
3. The placeholders in the SQL query for `colnames` and `options` are not being populated correctly.

### Bug Cause:
The bug in the function is primarily caused by incorrect usage of class methods and incorrect placeholder replacement in the SQL query.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to:
1. Call the `copy_options()` function correctly.
2. Format the `colnames` variable properly inside the SQL query string.
3. Populate the placeholders in the SQL query with the actual values.

### Corrected Version of the `copy` Function:
```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.
    
    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames) if colnames else ''
    
    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options())
    )
```

In the corrected version:
- `copy_options()` is called as `self.copy_options()` in the SQL query construction.
- The `colnames` variable is properly formatted to include parentheses only when columns are present.
- Placeholders in the SQL query are populated correctly.

This corrected version should now pass the failing test.
