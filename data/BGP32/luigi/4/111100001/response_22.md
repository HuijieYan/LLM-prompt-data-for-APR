### Analysis:
1. The `copy` function in the `S3CopyToTable` class is responsible for copying data from an S3 location to a Redshift table.
2. The bug seems to be related to how the `colnames` variable is being constructed and used within the SQL query.
3. The failing test `test_s3_copy_with_nonetype_columns` expects the `colnames` to be an empty string when `columns` is `None`, but the current implementation does not handle this scenario correctly.
4. To fix the bug, we need to modify the logic for constructing `colnames` based on the `columns` attribute.
5. We should ensure that when `columns` is `None`, `colnames` should be an empty string.

### Bug Fix:
Here is a corrected version of the `copy` function in the `S3CopyToTable` class:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns is not None and len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options())
    )
```

### Changes made:
1. Added a check to see if `self.columns` is not `None` before constructing `colnames`.
2. When `self.columns` is `None`, `colnames` is set to an empty string.
3. Called `self.copy_options()` to ensure that this function is executed to provide the necessary copy options.

This corrected version should now pass the failing test `test_s3_copy_with_nonetype_columns`.
