### Analysis:
1. The `copy` function in the `S3CopyToTable` class is responsible for copying data from s3 into Redshift.
2. The `copy` function constructs a SQL query using the `cursor.execute` method based on attributes like `table`, `columns`, `source`, and `creds`.
3. The bug seems to be in the way `copy_options` method is called inside the `copy` function. It is being called as a function without parentheses, which should actually invoke the `copy_options` method to provide additional options for `COPY`.
4. The failing test `test_s3_copy_with_nonetype_columns` is mocking the execution of the `S3CopyToTable` task, setting columns as `None`, and then expecting the SQL query to have an empty `colnames` value.
   
### Bug Cause:
The bug is caused by the way the `copy_options` method is being referenced in the `copy` function. It is not being called properly as a method, resulting in missing copy options in the SQL query.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
The fix involves properly calling the `copy_options` method with parentheses to obtain the options for the `COPY` statement.

### Corrected Version of the `copy` function:
```python
    def copy(self, cursor, f):
        """
        Defines copying from s3 into redshift.
    
        If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
        """
        logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
        colnames = ''
        if len(self.columns) > 0:
            colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
            colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)
    
        cursor.execute("""
         COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
         CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
         {options}
         ;""".format(
            table=self.table,
            colnames=colnames,
            source=f,
            creds=self._credentials(),
            options=self.copy_options())
        )
```

### Result:
By fixing the bug by properly calling the `copy_options` method, the corrected version of the `copy` function should now construct the SQL query correctly with the additional copy options included. This correction should make the failing test `test_s3_copy_with_nonetype_columns` pass successfully.
