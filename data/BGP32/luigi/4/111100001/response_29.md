### Analysis:
1. The buggy function is responsible for copying data from S3 into Redshift.
2. The potential error location is in the `cursor.execute` statement where the `copy_options` function is not being called correctly.
3. The bug is caused by not calling the `copy_options()` function to retrieve the actual copy options to be passed to the `COPY` statement in Redshift.
4. The bug can be fixed by calling the `copy_options()` function to get the copy options and include them in the `cursor.execute` statement.
5. The corrected version of the code is provided below:

### Corrected Version:
```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options())
    )
```

By adding `()` to `self.copy_options`, we are correctly calling the function `copy_options` to get the actual copy options and include them in the execution of the `COPY` statement. This corrected version should now pass the failing test.
