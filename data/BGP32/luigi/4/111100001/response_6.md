### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `copy` in the `S3CopyToTable` class is responsible for copying data from S3 to Redshift.
2. The function constructs a SQL `COPY` statement using attributes of the class and executes it using the provided cursor.
3. The bug seems to be in the way the `copy_options` function is being called within the formatted SQL string.
4. The buggy function doesn't actually call the `copy_options` function but attempts to use it as a reference in the string formatting.
   
### Bug Cause:
The bug occurs because the `self.copy_options` is being passed as-is in the formatted SQL string without calling it as a function. This results in an incomplete SQL query.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to call the `self.copy_options()` function to get the correct value for the `options` in the SQL query.

### Corrected Version:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options())  # Corrected the usage of copy_options by calling it as a function
    )
```

By making this change, the `self.copy_options()` function will be called and its result will be used in the SQL query, fixing the bug.
