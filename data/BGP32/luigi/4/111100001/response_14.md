### Analysis:
The buggy function `copy` in the `S3CopyToTable` class is failing to properly format the SQL query for the `COPY` operation in Redshift. The issue lies in how the `options` string is being added to the query. The `options` variable is supposed to be a function call `self.copy_options`, but it is missing the parentheses to actually call the function.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is causing the `options` to be treated as a function rather than a value returned by a function call. This results in the omission of the necessary options in the `COPY` query.

### Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the `self.copy_options` function is called properly and its output is added to the `COPY` query as a string.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.
    
    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options())
    )
```

### Updated Version Rationale:
In the corrected version, the `self.copy_options` function is properly called by adding `()` at the end, which ensures that the function is executed and its output is used in the `COPY` query. This change should address the bug and make the `copy` function work correctly.
