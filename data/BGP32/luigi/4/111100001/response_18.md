### Analysis:
1. The buggy function is `copy` within the `S3CopyToTable` class in the `redshift.py` file.
2. The function is responsible for executing a `COPY` command to load data from S3 into Redshift.
3. The bug appears to be in how the `copy_options` function is called within the `cursor.execute` function, leading to incorrect SQL formatting.
4. The failing test `test_s3_copy_with_nonetype_columns` is mocking the behavior of the `S3CopyToTable` class and expects a specific SQL statement to be executed, including the empty `colnames`.
5. To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the `copy_options` function is correctly called and that the SQL statement is formatted correctly with `colnames` included when necessary.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is caused by not calling the `copy_options` function correctly within the `cursor.execute` function. As a result, the SQL statement is missing the `options` parameter, which leads to incorrect SQL formatting.

### Bug Fix:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the `copy_options` function is correctly called and that the SQL statement is properly formatted. We also need to make sure that `colnames` is included in the SQL statement when necessary. 

### Corrected Version:
```python
# Corrected copy function
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options())
    )
```

Now, the `copy` function should correctly call the `copy_options` function and format the SQL statement with the necessary parameters. This corrected version should pass the failing test.
