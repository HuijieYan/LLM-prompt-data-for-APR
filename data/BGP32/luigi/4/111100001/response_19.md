### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `copy` is defined in the `S3CopyToTable` class in the `luigi/contrib/redshift.py` file.
2. The `copy` function is supposed to form a `COPY` statement to load data from S3 to Redshift.
3. The potential error is in the way the `copy_options` function is called within the `COPY` statement in the `cursor.execute` method call.
4. The buggy code fails to call the `copy_options` function properly, leading to a potential bug in the SQL query formation.
5. To fix the bug, the `copy_options` function should be called like a method by adding `()` after it to actually execute it and get the options string.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is caused by not properly calling the `copy_options` function. In the buggy version, `self.copy_options` is just referenced without actually calling the function, which results in the `options` part of the `COPY` statement being empty. This leads to an incorrect SQL query formation.

### Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to call the `copy_options` function like a method by adding `()` after it. This will ensure that the function is executed to get the required options string for the `COPY` statement.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options())  # Fix: Call the copy_options function
    )
```

By making this change and calling `self.copy_options()` with `()`, the `COPY` statement will now include the correct options for the data copy operation.
