### Analysis:
The buggy function `copy` in the `S3CopyToTable` class is failing to properly format the SQL query for copying data from s3 into Redshift. The issue seems to be with the formatting of the `COPY` command and the placeholders for table name, columns, source, credentials, and options.

### Error Location:
The bug is in the `cursor.execute` call, particularly in the way placeholders are being passed for string interpolation.

### Cause of the Bug:
The bug is caused by not calling the `copy_options` function to retrieve the copy options and also incorrectly passing the `options` placeholder inside the SQL query in the `cursor.execute` statement. This is resulting in an incorrect SQL query being executed.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to properly call the `copy_options` function to get the copy options string and correctly pass it to the `cursor.execute` statement. Additionally, we need to replace `{options}` placeholder in the SQL query with the actual copy options value.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    # Add a call to the copy_options method to get copy options
    copy_options = self.copy_options()

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=copy_options)  # Passing the actual copy options here
    )
```

By making the above corrections, the `copy` function should now correctly format the `COPY` SQL query and execute it properly. This corrected version should pass the failing test provided.
