## Analysis:
The buggy function `copy(self, cursor, f)` in the `S3CopyToTable` class is not correctly formatting the SQL `COPY` statement. The `colnames` variable is not being properly formatted when dealing with empty columns, leading to incorrect SQL syntax.

## Bug:
The bug is caused by the `colnames` variable not being properly handled when there are no columns specified. This results in incorrect SQL syntax when constructing the `COPY` statement in the `S3CopyToTable.copy` function.

## Fix:
To fix the bug, we need to check if there are columns specified before formatting the `colnames` variable. If there are no columns, the `colnames` variable should be an empty string without including parentheses.

## Corrected Version:
```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)
    
    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options())
    )
```

By making this change, the bug in the `copy` function will be fixed, and it should now properly format the `COPY` statement in the Redshift SQL syntax.
