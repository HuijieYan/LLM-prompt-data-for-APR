## Analysis
The buggy function `copy` in the `S3CopyToTable` class from the `luigi.contrib.redshift.py` file is failing to execute the `COPY` command properly. It seems to be missing the call to `copy_options()` function to get the options for the `COPY` command.

## Bug Explanation
The bug is occurring because the `options` parameter in the `cursor.execute()` call within the `copy` function is not being properly set. The `options` parameter is supposed to be the result of calling the `copy_options()` function, which is missing from the template.

## Bug Fix Strategy
To fix this bug, we need to call the `copy_options()` function to get the options for the `COPY` command and include it in the `cursor.execute()` call within the `copy` function.

## Corrected Version
```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.
    
    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)
    
    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options())  # Fixed: Added call to copy_options() function
    )
```

By making this change, the `copy` function will now include the options for the `COPY` command obtained from the `copy_options()` function, fixing the bug and allowing the test to pass successfully.
