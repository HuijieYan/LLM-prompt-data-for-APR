### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `copy` in the `S3CopyToTable` class is responsible for copying data from an S3 source to a Redshift table.
2. The bug seems to be related to how the `copy_options` function is called within the `cursor.execute` statement.
3. The bug is likely causing the `options` parameter to be incorrectly passed to the SQL query string, leading to a failure in the test.
4. The bug can be fixed by properly invoking the `copy_options` function and using its returned value in the `cursor.execute` statement.
5. The corrected version is provided below:

### Corrected Version:
```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.
    
    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    options = self.copy_options()  # Call the copy_options function

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=options)  # Use the returned value from copy_options
    )
```

By correctly calling the `copy_options` function and using its return value in the `cursor.execute` statement, the bug should be fixed and the test should pass successfully.
