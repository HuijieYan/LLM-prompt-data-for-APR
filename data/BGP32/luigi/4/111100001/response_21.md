Analysis:
- The buggy function `copy` in the `S3CopyToTable` class is responsible for defining the copying process from S3 into Redshift.
- The function constructs a SQL `COPY` statement using values from the class attributes and executes it using the provided cursor.
- The potential bug lies in the way `colnames` are being handled in the SQL statement. If `self.columns` is None, it should not try to construct `colnames` as an empty string.

Cause of the Bug:
- The bug arises when `self.columns` is None (as seen in the failing test function).
- In this case, the buggy function attempts to construct `colnames` by iterating over None, leading to an AttributeError.

Fix Strategy:
- Check if `self.columns` is not None before constructing `colnames`.
- Update the SQL statement to handle the case when `colnames` may be an empty string.

Corrected Version of the Buggy Function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

By updating the `copy` function to check for None in `self.columns`, we ensure that the `colnames` construction is only performed when `self.columns` is not None, thus preventing the AttributeError. This corrected version should pass the failing test.
