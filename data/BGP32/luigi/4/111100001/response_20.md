## Analysis:
1. The buggy function `copy` in the `S3CopyToTable` class is responsible for copying data from S3 to Redshift.
2. The function constructs a SQL `COPY` statement based on the attributes of the task and executes it using a cursor.
3. The bug seems to be related to the construction of the `COPY` statement and the use of `copy_options()` function.
4. The failing test `test_s3_copy_with_nonetype_columns` checks if the correct SQL statement is being executed with the provided attributes.

## Bug Cause:
1. The bug is caused by not calling the `copy_options` function correctly.
2. In the buggy code, `copy_options` is treated as an attribute instead of a function, leading to it not being called to provide additional options for the `COPY` statement.

## Strategy for fixing the bug:
1. Correct the way `copy_options` function is called by adding parentheses to actually invoke the function.
2. Ensure that the `copy_options` function is defined properly to return any additional options needed for the `COPY` statement.

## Corrected Version:
```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options())  # Fixed: Added parentheses to call copy_options function
    )
```

By making the above correction, the `copy` function will correctly call the `copy_options` function to construct the `COPY` statement with any additional options before executing it. This should address the bug and make the function behave as intended.
