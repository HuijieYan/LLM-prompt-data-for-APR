### Analysis:
1. The `S3CopyToTable` class in the `luigi/contrib/redshift.py` file contains the `copy` function that is supposed to define copying from S3 into Redshift.
2. The buggy part of the `copy` function is in the line where `self.copy_options` is called without parentheses, but it should be a function call.
3. The failing test `test_s3_copy_with_nonetype_columns` is mocking the `RedshiftTarget` object and expects a `COPY` SQL statement to be executed with specific parameters.
4. The bug is caused by not correctly calling the `copy_options` function within the `COPY` SQL statement.
5. One strategy to fix the bug is to ensure that `self.copy_options()` is correctly called within the `cursor.execute` statement.

### Corrected Version:
```python
# The corrected version of the buggy function
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options())
    )
```

By making the above correction in the `copy` function of the `S3CopyToTable` class, the bug should be fixed and the corrected version should pass the failing test.
