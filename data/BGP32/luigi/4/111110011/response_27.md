### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `copy` in the class `S3CopyToTable` is attempting to check the length of `self.columns` without first checking if it's not `None`. This causes an error when `self.columns` is `None`, as seen in the failing test output.
2. The failing test is trying to run a task `DummyS3CopyToTableKey` with `columns=None`, triggering the bug in the `copy` function.
3. The error message indicates that there is a `TypeError` because an object of type `NoneType` (value of `self.columns`) has no length.
4. The suggested fix from the GitHub issue is to change the condition to `if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0` to prevent the error when `columns` is `None`.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is caused by attempting to get the length of `self.columns` without verifying if it's not `None`. When `columns` is `None`, the buggy function attempts to call `len(None)` which raises a `TypeError`.

### Proposed Fix:
Modify the if condition to specifically check if `self.columns` is not `None` before checking its length.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:  # Check if self.columns is not None before checking length
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

By making this change, the corrected version of the function should prevent the `TypeError` when `columns` is `None`.
