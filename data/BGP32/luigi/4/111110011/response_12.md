### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `copy` in the `S3CopyToTable` class is trying to check the length of `self.columns`, but it fails when `self.columns` is `None`.
2. The test function `test_s3_copy_with_nonetype_columns` is mocking the necessary objects and is testing the `S3CopyToTable` class by running a task and expects a specific `COPY` query to be executed.
3. The error message indicates a `TypeError` due to trying to get the length of `NoneType` object.
4. The GitHub issue points out that the bug was introduced in a certain pull request and suggests changing the condition `if len(self.columns) > 0` to `if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0`.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is caused by the buggy function attempting to get the length of `self.columns` without considering the case when `self.columns` is `None`.

### Bug Fix:
To fix the bug, we should modify the condition checking the length of `self.columns` by including a check for `self.columns` being non-None before checking its length.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

By making this change, the code should now handle the case where `self.columns` is `None` and prevent the `TypeError` that was occurring.
