### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `copy()` in the `S3CopyToTable` class is causing a `TypeError` when trying to get the length of `self.columns` which is None in certain cases.
2. The failing test `test_s3_copy_with_nonetype_columns()` is expecting the `copy()` function to handle the case when `columns` is `None`.
3. The GitHub issue mentions that the bug occurred when columns are not provided, leading to a type error due to the conditional check `if len(self.columns) > 0:`.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is caused by the conditional check `if len(self.columns) > 0` in the `copy()` function, which throws a `TypeError` when `self.columns` is `None`.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we can modify the conditional check to handle the case where `self.columns` is `None` by checking if `self.columns` is not `None` before checking its length.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
        """
        Defines copying from s3 into redshift.
    
        If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
        """
        logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
        colnames = ''
        if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:  # Check if columns not None before getting length
            colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
            colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)
    
        cursor.execute("""
         COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
         CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
         {options}
         ;""".format(
            table=self.table,
            colnames=colnames,
            source=f,
            creds=self._credentials(),
            options=self.copy_options)
        )
```

By making this change, the corrected version of the `copy()` function should now handle the case when `columns` is `None` and execute without causing a `TypeError` as reported in the failing test and GitHub issue.
