### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `copy(self, cursor, f)` in the `S3CopyToTable` class in the `luigi/contrib/redshift.py` file is failing due to a `TypeError`. The error occurs when trying to check the length of `self.columns`, which is set to `None`. This error is triggered in the `if len(self.columns) > 0:` line.
   
2. The failing test `test_s3_copy_with_nonetype_columns` in the `redshift_test.py` file creates an instance of `DummyS3CopyToTableKey` with `columns=None`. The test expects a specific `COPY` SQL statement to be executed, which is based on the provided arguments to the `copy` function.

3. The error message indicates that the issue is caused by `object of type 'NoneType' has no len()`. This error aligns with the analysis of attempting to get the length of `None` in the `copy` function.

4. The GitHub issue mentions that the bug was introduced in luigi 2.7.1 by a specific PR related to this functionality. The suggested fix is to modify the condition to `if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:` to prevent the error.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix this bug, we need to adjust the condition in the `copy` function to handle the case when `columns` is `None`. By following the suggestion in the GitHub issue, we will modify the condition to first check if `self.columns` exists before checking its length.

### Corrected Version of the Buggy Function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options())
    )
```

By making this adjustment, the corrected version of the function should now handle the case when `self.columns` is `None` without causing a `TypeError`. This corrected version should pass the failing test and resolve the GitHub issue related to the bug in the Redshift COPY functionality in Luigi.
