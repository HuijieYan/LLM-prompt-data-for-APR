### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `copy(self, cursor, f)` in the class `S3CopyToTable` within the `luigi/contrib/redshift.py` file is failing when `self.columns` is `None`.
2. The failing test `test_s3_copy_with_nonetype_columns` creates an instance of `DummyS3CopyToTableKey` with `columns=None` and expects the `copy` method to handle a scenario where `self.columns` is `None`.
3. The error occurs because the buggy function is trying to check the length of `self.columns` directly without checking if it is `None`, leading to a `TypeError` when it tries to use `len` on a `NoneType`.
4. The suggested fix from the GitHub issue is to guard against `None` explicitly using `if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0`.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to modify the condition checking for the length of `self.columns` to handle the case where `self.columns` is `None`. By changing the condition to explicitly check if `self.columns` is not `None` before checking its length, we can prevent the `TypeError` from occurring.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options())
    )
```

By modifying the condition `if len(self.columns) > 0` to `if self.columns`, we now explicitly check if `self.columns` is not `None` before proceeding to the `join` operation. This change ensures that the function does not attempt to use `NoneType` with `len`, fixing the bug reported in the failing test and GitHub issue.
