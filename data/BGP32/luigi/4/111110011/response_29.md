## Analysis:
1. The buggy function `copy` in the `S3CopyToTable` class from `luigi/contrib/redshift.py` is trying to check the length of `self.columns`, which results in a `TypeError` when `self.columns` is `None`.
2. The failing test `test_s3_copy_with_nonetype_columns` in `redshift_test.py` is mocking the `S3CopyToTable` task with `columns=None` and expects a specific `COPY` statement to be executed, which triggers the bug due to the `TypeError`.
3. The GitHub issue mentions the exact problem where providing `columns=None` causes the issue, and suggests a possible solution of using `if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0` to handle this scenario.
4. The bug can be fixed by including a check for `self.columns` before trying to get its length, ensuring that the code handles the case when `self.columns` is `None`.

## Bug Fix:
```python
class S3CopyToTable(rdbms.CopyToTable, _CredentialsMixin):
    
    # Previous code

    # Fixed copy function
    def copy(self, cursor, f):
        """
        Defines copying from s3 into redshift.
    
        If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
        """
        logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
        colnames = ''
        if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:
            colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
            colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)
    
        cursor.execute("""
         COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
         CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
         {options}
         ;""".format(
            table=self.table,
            colnames=colnames,
            source=f,
            creds=self._credentials(),
            options=self.copy_options)
        )
```

By adding the `if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:` check, the function will only try to process `self.columns` if it is not `None`, preventing the `TypeError` when `columns=None` is provided.
