### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `copy` inside the `S3CopyToTable` class is trying to check the length of `self.columns`, which can be None. This check causes a `TypeError` when attempting to find the length of a NoneType object.
2. The failing test `test_s3_copy_with_nonetype_columns` is mocking a task with `columns=None`, leading to the `self.columns` being None in the `copy` function, triggering the bug.
3. The error message indicates that the issue is caused by `TypeError: object of type 'NoneType' has no len()`, matching the observation of trying to call `len` on a NoneType object.
4. To fix the bug, we can modify the condition checking for the length of `self.columns` to also check if `self.columns` is not None before attempting to find the length.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
  
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:  # Check that self.columns is not None before checking the length
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

By including the check `if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0` in the modified version of the `copy` function, we ensure that `self.columns` is not None before attempting to find its length, hence avoiding the `TypeError` for the NoneType object. This correction should address the bug and allow the function to run successfully with `columns=None`.
