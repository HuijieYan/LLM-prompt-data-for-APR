### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `copy` in the `S3CopyToTable` class is supposed to perform a `COPY` operation from S3 to Redshift. The bug occurs when `self.columns` is `None`, which leads to a `TypeError` as it tries to check the length of a `NoneType` object.

### Error Location:
- The line causing the error is `if len(self.columns) > 0:` when `self.columns` is `None`.

### Cause of the Bug:
- The bug occurs because the function is trying to get the length of `self.columns` without checking if it is `None` first. This leads to a `TypeError` when trying to check the length of a `None` object.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
- We should modify the conditional check to first ensure that `self.columns` is not `None` before checking its length.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:  # Fixing the check for None
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options())
    )
```

By making this change, we ensure that the length check is only performed when `self.columns` is not `None`, fixing the bug identified in the failing test and reported GitHub issue.
