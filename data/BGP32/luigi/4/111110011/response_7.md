### Analyzing the buggy function:
1. The buggy function `copy` in the `S3CopyToTable` class tries to construct and execute a `COPY` SQL query to load data from S3 into Redshift.
2. The error occurs when the columns attribute is `None`, causing a `TypeError` because `None` does not have a length.
3. Looking at the failing test `test_s3_copy_with_nonetype_columns`, it mocks a RedshiftTarget and calls `task.run()` which triggers the `copy` function with `columns=None`.
4. The error message clearly states that a `TypeError` occurs due to trying to call `len()` on a `NoneType` object.

### Bug Cause:
The bug occurs because the code does not check if `self.columns` is `None` before trying to find its length.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to add a condition to check if `self.columns` is not `None` before trying to get its length.

### Corrected Version of the `copy` function:
```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:  # Check if self.columns is not None
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options())
    )
```

By adding the condition `if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0`, we ensure that the code proceeds to construct the `COPY` query only when `self.columns` is not `None`. This correction will prevent the `TypeError` from occurring when `columns` are `None`.
