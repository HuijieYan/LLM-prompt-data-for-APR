### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `copy` within the `S3CopyToTable` class is attempting to check the length of `self.columns`, but the issue arises when `columns` is `None`.
2. The error message indicates a `TypeError` due to trying to get the length of a `NoneType` object.
3. The failing test `test_s3_copy_with_nonetype_columns` is testing the behavior when `columns` is `None`, but the buggy code does not handle this scenario correctly.
4. The GitHub issue suggests a possible solution, which involves changing the check for the length of `self.columns` to `if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0`.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we should update the condition in the `copy` function to handle the case when `self.columns` is `None` appropriately. By checking if `self.columns` exists and has a length greater than 0 before proceeding, we can avoid the `TypeError`.

### Corrected Version of the Buggy Function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
        COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
        CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
        {options}
        ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options())
    )
```

By making the above correction in the `copy` function, we ensure that the code will handle the scenario where `self.columns` is `None` without raising a `TypeError`. This updated version should pass the failing test and resolve the issue reported on GitHub.
