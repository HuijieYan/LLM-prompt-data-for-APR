## Analysis:
1. The `S3CopyToTable` class in the `luigi.contrib.redshift.py` file defines a `copy` function that is responsible for copying data from S3 to Redshift.
2. The failing test `test_s3_copy_with_nonetype_columns` in the `redshift_test.py` file is trying to run the `DummyS3CopyToTableKey` task which has `columns` set to `None`.
3. The error message indicates a `TypeError: object of type 'NoneType' has no len()` due to trying to get the length of a `NoneType` object.
4. The GitHub issue suggests that the failing condition `if len(self.columns) > 0` should be modified to `if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0`.
5. The bug occurs because the `columns` attribute can sometimes be `None` and the code doesn't handle this case.

## Correction:
To fix the bug, we need to modify the condition where it checks for the length of `self.columns`. We will update the condition to first check if `self.columns` is not `None` before trying to get its length.

### Corrected version of the `copy` function:
```python
    def copy(self, cursor, f):
        """
        Defines copying from s3 into redshift.
    
        If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
        """
        logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
        colnames = ''
        if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:
            colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
            colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)
    
        cursor.execute("""
         COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
         CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
         {options}
         ;""".format(
            table=self.table,
            colnames=colnames,
            source=f,
            creds=self._credentials(),
            options=self.copy_options())
        )
```

By making this change, we ensure that if `self.columns` is `None`, the attempt to get its length is avoided, preventing the `TypeError` mentioned in the failing test.

This corrected version should now pass the failing test and address the issue reported on GitHub.
