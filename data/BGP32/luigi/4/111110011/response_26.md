## Analyze the buggy function and the failing test

1. The buggy function `copy` in the `S3CopyToTable` class of `luigi.contrib.redshift` is failing because it tries to check the length of `self.columns` without verifying if `self.columns` is not `None` which leads to a `TypeError`.
2. The failing test `test_s3_copy_with_nonetype_columns` in `redshift_test.py` is testing a scenario where `columns` is `None` resulting in the failing of the `copy` function.
3. The error message indicates a `TypeError: object of type 'NoneType' has no len()` which points to the issue in the `copy` function where `self.columns` can potentially be `None`.
4. The GitHub issue suggests a potential fix by modifying the line where the length of `self.columns` is checked to handle the case where `self.columns` is `None`.

## Fix strategy

To fix the bug, we need to modify the code in the `copy` function by first checking if `self.columns` is not `None` before proceeding to check the length of `self.columns`. This will prevent the `TypeError` when `columns` is `None`.

## The corrected version of the buggy function

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns is not None and len(self.columns) > 0:  # Check if self.columns is not None
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)  # Make sure to call self.copy_options to get the value
    )
```

By making this change, the corrected `copy` function will now handle the scenario where `columns` is `None`, avoiding the `TypeError` and resolving the bug.
