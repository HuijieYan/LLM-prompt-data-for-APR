## Analysis:
1. The buggy function `copy` in the class `S3CopyToTable` from `luigi/contrib/redshift.py` is causing an error due to trying to get the length of a `None` type object.
2. The failing test `test_s3_copy_with_nonetype_columns` in `test/contrib/redshift_test.py` is checking the behavior when `columns=None`.
3. The error message indicates a `TypeError: object of type 'NoneType' has no len()`.
4. The related GitHub issue suggests changing the condition from `if len(self.columns) > 0:` to `if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:` as a possible solution.
5. The bug is caused by trying to get the length of `self.columns` when it is `None`. The fix should include a check for `None` before getting the length.

## Bug Fix:
To fix the bug, we need to add a check for `None` before checking the length of `self.columns` in the `copy` function.

## Corrected Version:
```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:  # Check for None before getting the length
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options())
    )
```

By adding a check for `None` in the condition before getting the length of `self.columns`, the bug should be fixed, and the corrected version should pass the failing test.
