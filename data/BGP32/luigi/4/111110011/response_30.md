### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `copy` in the `S3CopyToTable` class is trying to check the length of `self.columns`, but it fails when `self.columns` is `None`.
2. The failing test `test_s3_copy_with_nonetype_columns` checks the behavior when `columns` is `None`.
3. The error message indicates that the issue is caused by trying to get the length of a `NoneType` object.
4. The GitHub issue explains that in the specific case of `columns` being `None`, the check should be modified to handle this scenario.

### Bug Cause:
The bug occurs because the code is directly trying to check the length of `self.columns` without considering it could be `None`. When `self.columns` is `None`, it raises a `TypeError` as `NoneType` does not have a length.

### Bug Fix:
Modify the condition checking the length of `self.columns` to handle the case where `self.columns` is `None`.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options())
    )
```

By modifying the condition `if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0`, we ensure that the code can handle the case where `self.columns` is `None`. This correction should address the bug and make the function work correctly in scenarios where `columns` is not provided.
