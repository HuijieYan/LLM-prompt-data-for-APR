### Analysis:
1. **Buggy function:** The buggy function is `copy` within the `S3CopyToTable` class in the `luigi/contrib/redshift.py` file. It is responsible for copying data from S3 into Redshift.
2. **Bug location:** The bug is located in the line `if len(self.columns) > 0:` where it throws a `TypeError` due to `self.columns` being `None`.
3. **Bug cause:** The bug is caused when trying to calculate the length of `self.columns` without first checking if `self.columns` is `None`.
4. **Strategy for fixing:** To fix the bug, the code needs to be updated to check if `self.columns` has a value before checking its length.

### Corrected Version:
```python
    def copy(self, cursor, f):
        """
        Defines copying from s3 into redshift.
    
        If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
        """
        logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
        colnames = ''
        if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:
            colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
            colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)
    
        cursor.execute("""
         COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
         CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
         {options}
         ;""".format(
            table=self.table,
            colnames=colnames,
            source=f,
            creds=self._credentials(),
            options=self.copy_options())
        )
```

With this correction, the code now checks if `self.columns` has a value before attempting to calculate its length, preventing the `TypeError` when `self.columns` is `None`. This change aligns with the suggested solution in the GitHub issue.
