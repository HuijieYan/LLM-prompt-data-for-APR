### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `copy` within the `S3CopyToTable` class in `luigi/contrib/redshift.py` is causing a `TypeError` when `self.columns` is `None`.
2. The issue is related to the condition `if len(self.columns) > 0` which throws an error when `self.columns` is `None`.
3. The failing test `test_s3_copy_with_nonetype_columns` is trying to test the behavior when `columns=None`.
4. The error message indicates that it's a `TypeError` caused by trying to get the length of a `NoneType` object.
5. The GitHub issue suggests that the bug was introduced by a recent change and proposes a solution to check if `self.columns` is not None before checking its length.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is caused by trying to get the length of `self.columns` without first checking if it's `None`.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we should add a check to see if `self.columns` is not `None` before trying to get its length.

### Corrected Version of the Buggy Function:
```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: luigi/contrib/redshift.py

# The declaration of the class containing the buggy function
class S3CopyToTable(rdbms.CopyToTable, _CredentialsMixin):
    """
    Template task for inserting a data set into Redshift from s3.
    
    Usage:
    
    * Subclass and override the required attributes:
    
      * `host`,
      * `database`,
      * `user`,
      * `password`,
      * `table`,
      * `columns`,
      * `s3_load_path`.
    
    * You can also override the attributes provided by the
      CredentialsMixin if they are not supplied by your
      configuration or environment variables.
    """


    # This function from the same class is called by the buggy function
    def copy_options(self):
        # Please ignore the body of this function



    # The corrected version of the buggy function
    def copy(self, cursor, f):
        """
        Defines copying from s3 into redshift.
    
        If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
        """
        logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
        colnames = ''
        if self.columns is not None and len(self.columns) > 0:
            colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
            colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)
    
        cursor.execute("""
         COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
         CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
         {options}
         ;""".format(
            table=self.table,
            colnames=colnames,
            source=f,
            creds=self._credentials(),
            options=self.copy_options)
        )
```

By adding the check `if self.columns is not None and len(self.columns) > 0`, we can prevent the `TypeError` when `self.columns` is `None`. This correction should resolve the bug and make the function behave as intended.
