### Analysis:
The buggy function `copy` in the `S3CopyToTable` class is causing an error due to the attempt to check the length of `self.columns`, which is set to `None`. This error is revealed by the failing test `test_s3_copy_with_nonetype_columns`, where the test task is created with `columns=None`. The issue on GitHub has identified the root cause as the check `if len(self.columns) > 0` in the buggy function.

### Bug Cause:
The bug occurs because `self.columns` is initialized as `None`, and the buggy function attempts to check the length of `self.columns`, causing a `TypeError` when trying to call `len()` on a `NoneType`.

### Suggested Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to update the condition in the `copy` function to check if `self.columns` is not None before checking its length. The suggestion from the GitHub issue provides a solution by changing the condition to `if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0`.

### Corrected Version:
Here is the corrected version of the `copy` function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:  # Check if self.columns is not None
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options())
    )
```

By making this change, the function will now properly handle cases where `self.columns` is `None`, preventing the `TypeError` from occurring. This corrected version should pass the failing test `test_s3_copy_with_nonetype_columns` and resolve the issue reported on GitHub.
