Based on the analysis of the buggy function and the failing test provided, the bug occurs in the `copy` function inside the `S3CopyToTable` class in the luigi/contrib/redshift.py file. The bug arises when the `columns` attribute is set to `None`, causing the following error when trying to check its length: `TypeError: object of type 'NoneType' has no len()`.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the conditional statement checking the length of `self.columns`. We will change it to check if `self.columns` is not None before trying to access its length. This will prevent the `NoneType` error from occurring.

Here is the corrected version of the `copy` function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:  # Check if self.columns is not None before checking length
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

With this modification, the `copy` function will first check if `self.columns` is not None before trying to access its length, thus preventing the TypeError when `columns` is None in the test scenario provided.

This corrected version of the `copy` function should resolve the bug and pass the failing test.
