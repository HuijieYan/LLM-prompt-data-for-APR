The buggy function `copy` in the `S3CopyToTable` class is causing an error due to checking the length of `self.columns`, which is set to `None` in the failing test. This results in a `TypeError` when trying to calculate the length of a `NoneType` object.

To fix this issue, we can modify the condition to check if `self.columns` exists and is not equal to `None` before evaluating its length.

Here is the corrected version of the `copy` function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options())
    )
```

By making this change, the function will only attempt to determine the length of `self.columns` if it exists and is not `None`, avoiding the `TypeError` encountered in the failing test.

This correction should address the issue reported in the GitHub thread related to Redshift COPY operations failing when columns are set to `None`.
