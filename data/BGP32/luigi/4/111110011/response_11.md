### Explanation:
The buggy function `copy` in the `S3CopyToTable` class is failing when the `columns` attribute is set to `None`, resulting in a `TypeError` due to trying to get the length of a `NoneType` object.

The root cause of the bug is that the code is directly checking `if len(self.columns) > 0` without verifying if `self.columns` is `None` or not. This issue is also addressed in an open GitHub issue where it suggests changing the line to `if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0` to prevent this error.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to check if `self.columns` is not `None` before trying to get its length. By doing this, we can avoid the `TypeError` that occurs when attempting to get the length of a `NoneType` object.

### Corrected Version of the Buggy Function:
```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

By updating the `copy` function as shown above, we ensure that we only attempt to calculate the length of `self.columns` if it is not `None`. This correction should resolve the `TypeError` issue encountered when `columns` is set to `None`.
