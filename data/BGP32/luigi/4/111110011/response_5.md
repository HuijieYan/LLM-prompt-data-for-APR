## Corrected Version

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:  # Check if self.columns is not None before checking the length
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options())
    )
```

### Explanation:
1. The bug occurred because the original code did not check if `self.columns` was `None` before trying to access its length using `len()`. This caused a `TypeError` when trying to get the length of `None`.
2. By updating the condition to `if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:`, we ensure that we first check if `self.columns` is not `None` before trying to access its length. This prevents the `TypeError` from occurring.
3. The suggested solution from the GitHub issue was to change this line to include the check for `self.columns`, which is implemented in the corrected version.
4. By making this change, the corrected version of the function should now pass the failing test and resolve the issue reported on GitHub.
