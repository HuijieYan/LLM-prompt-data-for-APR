### Analysis:
- **Buggy Function**: The `copy` method in the `S3CopyToTable` class from `luigi/contrib/redshift.py`.
- **Related Functions**: The `copy_options` method in the same class is called by the `copy` method.
- **Test Code**: The failing test `test_s3_copy_with_nonetype_columns` in `test/contrib/redshift_test.py`.
- **Error Message**: TypeError: object of type 'NoneType' has no len().
- **GitHub Issue**: The issue title is "Redshift COPY fails in luigi 2.7.1 when columns are not provided".

### Error Locations:
1. Attempting to call `len` on `self.columns` which can be `None`.
2. The placeholder for `colnames` concatenation is not correctly handled.
3. `copy_options` is intended to be a method call, but it is referenced without parentheses.

### Cause of the Bug:
- The bug occurs when the `columns` attribute is set to `None`, resulting in a `TypeError` when trying to get the length of `None`.
- The `colnames` variable is not handled correctly for the scenario when columns are not provided.
- The incorrect reference to `copy_options` without calling it as a function.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
- Check if `self.columns` is not `None` before trying to get its length.
- Update the concatenation of `colnames` to handle the case when `columns` is `None`.
- Correctly reference `copy_options` as a method call in the `execute` string.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames) if colnames else ''

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}()
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options())
    )
```

After applying the corrections, the `copy` method should now handle the scenario when `columns` is `None` without causing any errors. It should pass the failing test and resolve the issue mentioned on GitHub.
