Based on the provided information, the bug in the function `copy` of the `S3CopyToTable` class is due to the condition `if len(self.columns) > 0:` where `self.columns` has a value of `None` causing a `TypeError`. The bug occurs when trying to check the length of `self.columns` without first checking if it's `None`.

To fix this bug, the condition `if len(self.columns) > 0:` should be modified to `if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:` to ensure that the length is only checked if `self.columns` has a value other than `None`.

Here is the corrected version of the `copy` function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:  # Check if self.columns is not None before getting its length
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options())
    )
```

By making this change, the bug related to `TypeError: object of type 'NoneType' has no len()` should be resolved and the function should work correctly with the test case provided.

This corrected version ensures that the `if` condition only checks the length of `self.columns` if it is not `None`.
