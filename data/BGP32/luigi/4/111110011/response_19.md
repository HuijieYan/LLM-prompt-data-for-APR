## Analysis
1. The buggy function `copy` in the `S3CopyToTable` class has a bug where it tries to check the length of `self.columns` directly without first checking if `self.columns` is not `None`.
2. The failing test `test_s3_copy_with_nonetype_columns` tries to create an instance of `DummyS3CopyToTableKey` with `columns` set to `None`, leading to the bug in the `copy` function.
3. The error message points out that the bug occurs at line 338 in `luigi/contrib/redshift.py`, where `len(self.columns)` is called when `self.columns` is `None`.
4. The GitHub issue suggests a possible solution by changing the condition to `if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0` to prevent the `TypeError`.

## Bug Cause
The bug is caused by not handling the case where `self.columns` is `None` before trying to get its length in the `copy` function of the `S3CopyToTable` class.

## Bug Fix
To fix the bug, we need to check if `self.columns` is not `None` before proceeding to get its length. By making this change, we can prevent the `TypeError` when `self.columns` is `None`.

## Corrected Version
```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

By adding the condition `if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:`, we ensure that the code only tries to get the length of `self.columns` when it is not `None`, addressing the bug reported in the GitHub issue and allowing the corrected version to pass the failing test.
