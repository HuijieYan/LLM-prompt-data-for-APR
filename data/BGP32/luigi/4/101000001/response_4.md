Potential error locations in the buggy function:
1. The `options=self.copy_options` in the `cursor.execute` statement seems to be missing parentheses at the end, which may cause a TypeError since it should be a function call.

Cause of the bug:
The bug occurs because the `copy_options` function needs to be called to retrieve the options for the `COPY` statement, but the buggy code is not calling the function correctly. This leads to potential errors during the execution of the `COPY` statement.

Strategy for fixing the bug:
To fix the bug, we should ensure that the `copy_options` function is called correctly to provide the options for the `COPY` statement in the Redshift query.

Corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
# The corrected version of the buggy function
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options())
    )
```

In the corrected version, the `copy_options` function is now correctly called with parentheses at the end, ensuring that the options for the `COPY` statement are properly retrieved and executed. This fixes the bug in the original function.
