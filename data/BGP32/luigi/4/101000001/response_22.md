The bug in the provided function `copy` lies in the way the `copy_options` function is called within the `cursor.execute` statement. The `copy_options` function is not being called correctly, resulting in it not being executed as intended.

To fix this bug, we need to make sure that the `copy_options` function is properly called and its return value is included in the `cursor.execute` statement.

Here is the corrected version of the `copy` function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options())  # Corrected call to copy_options function
    )

```

In the corrected version, `self.copy_options()` function call is properly included within the `cursor.execute` statement, ensuring that the options returned by the `copy_options` function are used correctly.
