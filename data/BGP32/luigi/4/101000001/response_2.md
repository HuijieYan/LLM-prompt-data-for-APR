## Analysis:
1. The `copy` function within the `S3CopyToTable` class is attempting to copy data from S3 into Redshift.
2. The `cursor.execute` method is being used to execute a SQL query for copying data.
3. The `copy_options` function is expected to return a string with copy options.
4. The bug seems to be related to the incorrect usage of `self.copy_options` without invoking it as a function. It should be `self.copy_options()`.

## Bug Explanation:
The bug in the `copy` function arises from the incorrect usage of `self.copy_options` without parentheses. Due to this error, the `copy_options` function is not being called to retrieve the necessary copy options string, resulting in an incomplete SQL query.

## Bug Fix:
1. Update the line `options=self.copy_options)` to `options=self.copy_options())` in the `cursor.execute` method invocation to correctly call the `copy_options` function and retrieve the copy options string.

## Corrected Version:
```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options())
    )
```
