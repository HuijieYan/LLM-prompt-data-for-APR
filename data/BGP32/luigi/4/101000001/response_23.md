The bug in the provided function lies in how `copy_options` function is being called within the `cursor.execute` method in the `copy` function. The buggy code is using `self.copy_options` without actually invoking the function, resulting in passing a reference to the method rather than its return value.

To fix this bug, we need to properly call the `copy_options` function to get its return value and include it in the SQL query string. Here is the corrected version of the `copy` function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    # Call the copy_options method to get its return value
    copy_options_query = self.copy_options()

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=copy_options_query)  # Pass the return value of copy_options method
    )
``` 

In the corrected version, we called the `self.copy_options()` method to get the return value and then used that value in the `cursor.execute` method to ensure the correct options are included in the SQL query.
