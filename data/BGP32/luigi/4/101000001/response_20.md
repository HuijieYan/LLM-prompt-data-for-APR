## Analysis:
1. The `copy` function in the `S3CopyToTable` class is responsible for copying data from S3 into Redshift.
2. The function constructs a `COPY` SQL query using the provided parameters.
3. The buggy part is in the `cursor.execute` call where it tries to pass `self.copy_options` directly as a string, which should actually be a function call `self.copy_options()`.

## Bug:
The bug in the `copy` function is due to passing `self.copy_options` without calling it as a function. This results in `options=self.copy_options` being set to the function itself instead of the result of the function.

## Fix:
To fix the bug, we need to call the `self.copy_options` function to get the actual options string that should be included in the `COPY` query.

## Corrected Version:
```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options())
    )
``` 

In the corrected version, `self.copy_options()` is called as a function to get the actual options string. This will ensure that the `COPY` SQL query has the correct options included.
