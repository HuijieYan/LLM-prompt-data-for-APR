## Analysis:
1. The buggy function `copy` is responsible for copying data from S3 into Redshift.
2. The function constructs a SQL query string for the `COPY` command using parameters provided by the class instance.
3. The bug lies in how the `copy_options` function is used within the `cursor.execute` call. The `copy_options` function should be invoked to get the actual copy options string, but it is being passed as a reference without invocation.
4. The bug is caused by not invoking the `copy_options` function to get the actual options string to be included in the SQL query.
5. A potential fix would be to call the `copy_options` function and include its return value in the `cursor.execute` call.

## Bug Fix:
```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: luigi/contrib/redshift.py

class S3CopyToTable(rdbms.CopyToTable, _CredentialsMixin):
    
    def copy_options(self):
        # Implementation of copy_options function


    def copy(self, cursor, f):
        logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
        colnames = ''
        if len(self.columns) > 0:
            colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
            colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)
    
        cursor.execute("""
         COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
         CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
         {options}
         ;""".format(
            table=self.table,
            colnames=colnames,
            source=f,
            creds=self._credentials(),
            options=self.copy_options())  # Invoke copy_options function to get the options string
        )
```

By calling the `copy_options` function with `()` to get the actual options string, the bug is fixed. Now the correct options will be included in the `COPY` SQL query.
