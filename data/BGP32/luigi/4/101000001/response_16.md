The buggy function `copy` in the `S3CopyToTable` class is failing to call the `copy_options` function correctly. It should be `self.copy_options()` instead of `self.copy_options` to actually execute the function and include its return value in the `cursor.execute` call.

Here is the corrected version of the `copy` function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options())
    )

```

By making this change, the `copy_options` function will be properly called within the `cursor.execute` statement, and the correct options will be included in the SQL query for copying data from S3 into Redshift.
