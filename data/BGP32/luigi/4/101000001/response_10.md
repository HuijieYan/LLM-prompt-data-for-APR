There are several potential errors in the buggy function `copy`:

1. The `copy_options` function is being called incorrectly in the string formatting of the SQL query. It should be `self.copy_options()` instead of `self.copy_options`.
2. The `creds` variable should be passed as a parameter directly to the SQL query instead of being enclosed in single quotes.

The bug is caused by passing the `self.copy_options` function itself rather than calling it. This results in the SQL query being formatted incorrectly, causing the `cursor.execute` method to fail.

To fix the bug, we need to call the `self.copy_options` function, pass the `creds` variable without enclosing it in single quotes, and correct the string formatting of the SQL query.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS {creds}
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options())
    )
```

In this corrected version, we are calling the `copy_options` function properly, passing the `creds` variable without enclosing it in single quotes, and ensuring the correct string formatting of the SQL query.
