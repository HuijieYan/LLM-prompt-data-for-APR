### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `copy` is responsible for copying data from an S3 source to a Redshift table.
2. The function is using string formatting to construct the SQL query for the `COPY` operation.
3. The bug in the function lies in how `self.copy_options` is used in the formatting, as it should be a function call but is missing parentheses.
4. The buggy function does not properly call the `copy_options` function, leading to a potential error when executing the SQL query.

### Bug Cause:
The bug occurs because `self.copy_options` is not being properly called as a function, hence it is not providing the correct query options for the `COPY` operation.

### Fix Strategy:
1. Modify the function call to `self.copy_options()` to correctly invoke the function and fetch the necessary options for the `COPY` operation.
2. Ensure that the options returned by the `self.copy_options()` function are formatted correctly to be included in the SQL query.

### Corrected Version:
```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: luigi/contrib/redshift.py

# The declaration of the class containing the buggy function
class S3CopyToTable(rdbms.CopyToTable, _CredentialsMixin):
    # This function from the same class is called by the buggy function
    def copy_options(self):
        # Please ignore the body of this function



    # this is the corrected version of the buggy function
    def copy(self, cursor, f):
        """
        Defines copying from s3 into redshift.
    
        If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
        """
        logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
        colnames = ''
        if len(self.columns) > 0:
            colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
            colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)
    
        cursor.execute("""
         COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
         CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
         {options}
         ;""".format(
            table=self.table,
            colnames=colnames,
            source=f,
            creds=self._credentials(),
            options=self.copy_options())
        )
```

In the corrected version, we have modified `self.copy_options` to `self.copy_options()` to correctly call the function and fetch the necessary options for the `COPY` operation.
