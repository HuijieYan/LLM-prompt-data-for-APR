## Analysis:
The buggy function `copy` is intended to copy data from S3 into Redshift. It constructs a SQL query using string formatting to include table name, column names, source file, credentials, and copy options. However, there are a few issues in the implementation that need to be addressed.

## Identified issues:
1. There is a missing parenthesis `()` when calling the `copy_options` function. This results in the function reference being used instead of calling the function, which will cause an error during execution.
2. The `_credentials()` method is being called without checking for the existence of both key-based and role-based credentials as mentioned in the function docstring.

## Bug Cause:
The bug in the function arises from using the reference to the `copy_options` function without calling it and missing the parenthesis. This leads to passing a function reference as a string to the SQL query, which causes a syntax error.

## Strategy for fixing the bug:
1. Call the `copy_options` function to retrieve the options string to be included in the SQL query.
2. Check for the availability of both key-based and role-based credentials before calling the `_credentials()` method.

## Corrected Version:
```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.
    
    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options())
    )
``` 

In the corrected version, we have added parentheses to the `self.copy_options` method to ensure it is called and returns the options string. Additionally, it is recommended to add a check for the availability of both key-based and role-based credentials before calling the `_credentials()` method to prevent any unexpected behavior.
