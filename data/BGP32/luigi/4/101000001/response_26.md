## Analysis:
1. The `copy` function within the `S3CopyToTable` class is responsible for copying data from S3 into Redshift.
2. The function constructs a SQL query using the provided table, columns, source file, credentials, and copy options.
3. The bug is likely due to the incorrect handling of the `copy_options` function call in the string formatting of the SQL query. The function `copy_options` is not being called correctly.
4. To fix the bug, we need to ensure that `copy_options()` is called as a method to retrieve the copy options string.

## Correction:
```python
# The corrected version of the buggy function
class S3CopyToTable(rdbms.CopyToTable, _CredentialsMixin):
    def copy_options(self):
        # Please ignore the body of this function

    def copy(self, cursor, f):
        """
        Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

        If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
        """
        logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
        colnames = ''
        if len(self.columns) > 0:
            colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
            colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

        cursor.execute("""
         COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
         CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
         {options}
         ;""".format(
            table=self.table,
            colnames=colnames,
            source=f,
            creds=self._credentials(),
            options=self.copy_options())
        )
```

With this correction, the `copy_options` function is now called correctly as a method `copy_options()`. This will ensure that the function is properly executed to retrieve the copy options string for the SQL query.
