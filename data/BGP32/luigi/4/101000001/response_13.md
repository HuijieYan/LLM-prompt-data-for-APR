The bug in the provided function `copy` is related to the `self.copy_options` call inside the `cursor.execute()` statement. It seems that `self.copy_options` should be a function call, but it is missing parentheses to actually execute the function and retrieve its result.

Here are the steps to fix the bug:

1. Update the `copy_options` function in the class to return the required copy options.
2. Modify the `copy` function to call `self.copy_options()` with parentheses to execute the function and retrieve the options.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options())
    )
```

By adding parentheses to `self.copy_options`, the function will be called correctly, and its result will be included in the `COPY` command as intended.
