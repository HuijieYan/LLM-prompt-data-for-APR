## Analysis:
- The buggy function `copy` in the `S3CopyToTable` class is responsible for copying data from S3 into Redshift.
- The function constructs a SQL query using string formatting to execute the `COPY` operation.
- It utilizes attributes like `self.table`, `self.columns`, `f`, `_credentials()`, and `self.copy_options` to build the query.

## Identified Issue:
The bug in the `copy` function lies in the placeholder `{options}` within the SQL query string. At the end of the constructed SQL query, `options=self.copy_options` should be `options=self.copy_options()` to actually call the `copy_options` function and include its return value in the query.

## Bug Cause:
The bug occurs because the `self.copy_options` attribute is mistakenly being passed as a function reference (`self.copy_options`) rather than being called as a function (`self.copy_options()`). This results in the `options` part of the SQL query being assigned the function object itself instead of its return value.

## Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to call the `copy_options` function using `self.copy_options()` to include the result of the function in the SQL query. By invoking the function, we ensure that the SQL query includes the correct options for the `COPY` operation.

## Corrected Version:
```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
        """
        Defines copying from s3 into redshift.
    
        If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
        """
        logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
        colnames = ''
        if len(self.columns) > 0:
            colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
            colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)
    
        cursor.execute("""
         COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
         CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
         {options}
         ;""".format(
            table=self.table,
            colnames=colnames,
            source=f,
            creds=self._credentials(),
            options=self.copy_options())  # Fix: Call the function to get the options
        )
```

By making this correction in the `copy` function, the `copy_options` function will be correctly called, and its return value will be included as the options in the SQL query for the `COPY` operation.
