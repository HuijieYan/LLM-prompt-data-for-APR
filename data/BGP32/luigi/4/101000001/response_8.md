## Analysis:
The buggy function `copy` in the `S3CopyToTable` class is responsible for copying data from S3 into Redshift. The function constructs and executes a SQL COPY command using the parameters provided. The bug seems to be related to how the `copy_options` function is being used within the `cursor.execute` call.

## Potential Error Location:
The buggy line seems to be:
```python
options=self.copy_options)
```
Here, `self.copy_options` is being used as a method reference without calling it.

## Bug Cause:
The bug occurs because `self.copy_options` is a method reference but needs to be called as a method to retrieve the actual copy options string. Since it is not being called and just provided as a reference, the SQL query is incomplete or incorrect.

## Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to call the `copy_options` method to get the actual copy options string before passing it to the `cursor.execute` call. This ensures that the SQL query executes correctly with all the necessary parameters.

## Corrected Version:
```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: luigi/contrib/redshift.py

# The declaration of the class containing the corrected function
class S3CopyToTable(rdbms.CopyToTable, _CredentialsMixin):
    # This function from the same class is called by the corrected function
    def copy_options(self):
        # Please ignore the body of this function



    # This is the corrected function
    def copy(self, cursor, f):
        """
        Defines copying from s3 into redshift.
    
        If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
        """
        logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
        colnames = ''
        if len(self.columns) > 0:
            colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
            colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)
    
        cursor.execute("""
         COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
         CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
         {options}
         ;""".format(
            table=self.table,
            colnames=colnames,
            source=f,
            creds=self._credentials(),
            options=self.copy_options())
        )
```

In the corrected version, we have called the `copy_options` method by adding `()` at the end to ensure that it returns the actual copy options string before it is passed to the `cursor.execute` call. This should fix the bug and allow the SQL query to execute correctly.
