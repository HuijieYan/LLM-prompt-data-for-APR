The bug in the provided function is in the `cursor.execute` block. Specifically, the `options=self.copy_options` line should actually call the `copy_options` method to retrieve the options string. However, in the buggy code, it is missing the parentheses, and it is not calling the `copy_options` method correctly.

Here is the corrected version of the function with the fix applied:

```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: luigi/contrib/redshift.py

# The declaration of the class containing the buggy function
class S3CopyToTable(rdbms.CopyToTable, _CredentialsMixin):
    # This function from the same class is called by the buggy function
    def copy_options(self):
        # Please ignore the body of this function



    # this is the corrected function
    def copy(self, cursor, f):
        """
        Defines copying from s3 into redshift.
    
        If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
        """
        logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
        colnames = ''
        if len(self.columns) > 0:
            colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
            colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)
    
        cursor.execute("""
         COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
         CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
         {options}
         ;""".format(
            table=self.table,
            colnames=colnames,
            source=f,
            creds=self._credentials(),
            options=self.copy_options())  # Fixed the function call here
        )
```

By adding parentheses `()` to `self.copy_options` in the `cursor.execute` block, the `copy_options` method is correctly called to retrieve the options string. This correction ensures that the options string is properly included in the SQL query when executing the `COPY` command.
