The issue in the given buggy function is with the `options` parameter in the `cursor.execute()` method. The `options` parameter is being passed as a function reference `self.copy_options` instead of calling the function `self.copy_options()`.

To fix this bug, we need to call the `self.copy_options()` function and pass its return value as the `options` parameter in the `cursor.execute()` method.

Here is the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: luigi/contrib/redshift.py

# The declaration of the class containing the buggy function
class S3CopyToTable(rdbms.CopyToTable, _CredentialsMixin):
    # This function from the same class is called by the buggy function
    def copy_options(self):
        # Please ignore the body of this function
    
    # The corrected version of the buggy function
    def copy(self, cursor, f):
        """
        Defines copying from s3 into redshift.
    
        If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
        """
        logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
        colnames = ''
        if len(self.columns) > 0:
            colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
            colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)
    
        cursor.execute("""
         COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
         CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
         {options}
         ;""".format(
            table=self.table,
            colnames=colnames,
            source=f,
            creds=self._credentials(),
            options=self.copy_options())
        )
```

By calling `self.copy_options()` in the `cursor.execute()` method, we are passing the return value of the `copy_options` function as the `options` parameter, which is the correct way to handle this bug.
