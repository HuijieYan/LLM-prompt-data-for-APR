There are a few issues in the buggy function `copy` that need to be fixed:
1. `self.copy_options` is not being called as a function (missing parentheses), resulting in the options not being populated correctly.
2. The curly braces `{}` in the SQL query string are not properly formatted, leading to issues with string interpolation.

To fix these issues, we need to ensure that `self.copy_options()` is correctly called as a function and correctly format the curly braces in the SQL query string.

Here is the corrected version of the `copy` function:

```python
# The corrected version of the buggy function
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options())
    )
```

In this corrected version, we have added parentheses to `self.copy_options` in the SQL query string to correctly call it as a function. We have also placed curly braces `{}` around `options` to format it correctly within the SQL query string.

These changes should fix the bug in the `copy` function and ensure that the SQL query is executed correctly.
