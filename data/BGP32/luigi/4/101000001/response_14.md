The bug in the provided function `copy()` is related to how the `copy_options` function is being called. In the `cursor.execute()` call, `self.copy_options` should be a function call `self.copy_options()`, not just a reference to the function.

Here is the corrected version:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options())
    )
```

In the `cursor.execute()` call, `self.copy_options` has been corrected to `self.copy_options()`, which will correctly call the `copy_options` function to retrieve the options needed for the `COPY` command.

This should fix the bug and properly execute the `COPY` command with the correct options.
