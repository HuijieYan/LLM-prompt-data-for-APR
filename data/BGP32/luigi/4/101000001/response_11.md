## Corrected Version of the Buggy Function

```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: luigi/contrib/redshift.py

# The declaration of the class containing the corrected function
class S3CopyToTable(rdbms.CopyToTable, _CredentialsMixin):
    # This function from the same class is called by the corrected function
    def copy_options(self):
        # Please ignore the body of this function



    # this is the corrected function
    def copy(self, cursor, f):
        """
        Defines copying from s3 into redshift.
    
        If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
        """
        logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
        colnames = ''
        if len(self.columns) > 0:
            colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
            colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)
    
        cursor.execute("""
         COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
         CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
         {options}
         ;""".format(
            table=self.table,
            colnames=colnames,
            source=f,
            creds=self._credentials(),
            options=self.copy_options())
        )
    
```

## Explanation:
1. The bug in the original function was that the `self.copy_options` was not being called as a function. It should have been `self.copy_options()` instead of `self.copy_options`.

2. The `self.copy_options` function was not being executed properly in the original function, leading to potential errors in generating the copy options for the query.

3. The bug was caused by not invoking the `copy_options` method correctly within the `cursor.execute` statement. This resulted in missing essential options needed for the copy operation, potentially causing unexpected behavior or errors.

4. The bug was fixed by correctly calling the `copy_options` method as a function by adding parentheses `()` after `self.copy_options` in the `cursor.execute` statement.

5. The corrected version of the function now invokes `self.copy_options()` to ensure that the copy options are properly generated and included in the executed query. This should resolve the bug and ensure the function works as intended.
