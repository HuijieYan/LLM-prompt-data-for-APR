Potential error locations:
1. In the line where colnames is assigned, there might be an issue with the formatting or joining of column names.
2. The use of self.copy_options without calling the function might lead to incorrect or missing copy options.

Explanation of the bug:
1. The bug in this function might occur due to incorrect formatting of column names in the SQL query.
2. Additionally, not calling the copy_options function could result in missing or incorrect copy options in the query.

Strategy for fixing the bug:
1. Ensure that the colnames variable is assigned correctly by formatting and joining the column names properly.
2. Call the copy_options function to get the actual options before adding them to the SQL query.

## Corrected version of the function
```python
    def copy(self, cursor, f):
        """
        Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

        If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
        """
        logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
        colnames = ''
        if len(self.columns) > 0:
            colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
            colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

        # Call the copy_options function to get the options
        options = self.copy_options()

        cursor.execute("""
         COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
         CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
         {options}
         ;""".format(
            table=self.table,
            colnames=colnames,
            source=f,
            creds=self._credentials(),
            options=options)
        )
``` 

By correcting the function as shown above, the bug related to incorrect column names format and missing copy options should be fixed.
