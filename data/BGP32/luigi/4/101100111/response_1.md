Based on the GitHub issue description and the failing test, the bug seems to be related to handling the `columns` parameter in the `S3CopyToTable.copy` function. The issue occurs when `self.columns` is set to `None`, leading to a `TypeError: object of type 'NoneType' has no len()` when trying to get the length of `self.columns`.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the condition where `colnames` are being constructed. Instead of directly checking if the length of `self.columns` is greater than 0, we should also check if `self.columns` is not `None`.

Here is the corrected version of the `copy` function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    
    # Check if self.columns is not None before checking its length
    if self.columns is not None and len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

This fix ensures that the `colnames` construction is only performed when `self.columns` is not `None`, preventing the `TypeError` when `self.columns` is `None`.

After applying this fix, the `test_s3_copy_with_nonetype_columns` test should pass without any errors, and the expected values should be satisfied.
