## Analysis
1. The function `copy` within the `S3CopyToTable` class is supposed to define the copying from S3 into Redshift. The function constructs a SQL query using the provided parameters but fails when `self.columns` is `None`.
2. The bug arises when the function attempts to analyze the length of `self.columns` without checking if it's not `None`.
3. The failing test expects that the `colnames` variable should be an empty string when `self.columns` is `None`. However, due to the bug, it results in a TypeError because it tries to calculate the length of `None`.
4. To fix the bug, a check should be added to verify that `self.columns` is not `None` before attempting to obtain its length.

## Bug Fix Strategy
- Add a check before trying to get the length of `self.columns`. If `self.columns` is `None`, set `colnames` to an empty string directly.

## Corrected Version
```python
class S3CopyToTable(rdbms.CopyToTable, _CredentialsMixin):
    
    def copy(self, cursor, f):
        """
        Defines copying from s3 into redshift.
    
        If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
        """
        logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
        colnames = ''
        if self.columns is not None:
            colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
            colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)
    
        cursor.execute("""
         COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
         CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
         {options}
         ;""".format(
            table=self.table,
            colnames=colnames,
            source=f,
            creds=self._credentials(),
            options=self.copy_options())
        )
```

By adding the check `if self.columns is not None`, we prevent the TypeError when `self.columns` is `None`. This corrected version should pass the failing test, satisfying the expected input/output values and resolving the GitHub issue.
