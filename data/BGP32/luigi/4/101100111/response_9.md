## Analysis
1. The buggy function `copy` is attempting to format a SQL `COPY` statement with the provided parameters but fails if `self.columns` is `None`.
2. The bug is related to the handling of the `self.columns` attribute, which is used to construct the column names for the `COPY` statement.
3. The failing test case expects an empty `colnames` since `columns` is `None`, but the buggy function does not handle this case correctly.
4. The bug was raised in a GitHub issue indicating that when `columns` is `None`, it results in an error due to trying to get the length of `None`.
5. The suggested fix is to check `if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0` to prevent the error when `columns` is `None`.

## Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to modify the `copy` function to handle the case when `self.columns` is `None`. By following the suggested solution from the GitHub issue, we will add a condition to check if `self.columns` is not `None` before trying to get its length.

## Corrected Version
```python
    def copy(self, cursor, f):
        """
        Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

        If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
        """
        logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
        colnames = ''
        if self.columns is not None and len(self.columns) > 0:
            colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
            colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

        cursor.execute("""
         COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
         CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
         {options}
         ;""".format(
            table=self.table,
            colnames=colnames,
            source=f,
            creds=self._credentials(),
            options=self.copy_options())
        )
```

By adding the condition `if self.columns is not None and len(self.columns) > 0`, we ensure that the code only tries to get the length of `self.columns` when it is not `None`. This correction should resolve the issue and pass the failing test case successfully.
