## Analysis:
1. The buggy function `copy` within the `S3CopyToTable` class in `luigi/contrib/redshift.py` is supposed to execute a `COPY` command to load data from an S3 bucket into Redshift. However, it fails when `self.columns` is set to `None`. The bug triggers a `TypeError` because the code tries to get the length of `None`.
   
2. The buggy line causing the error is:
   ```python
   if len(self.columns) > 0:
   ```

3. The cause of the bug is that when `self.columns` is `None`, it cannot be used in the condition for checking its length. This issue was identified in a GitHub issue where the user faced a similar problem and suggested correcting the line by checking for `self.columns` before getting its length to avoid the error.

4. To fix the bug, the condition `if self.columns is not None and len(self.columns) > 0` should be used. This way, it first checks if `self.columns` is not `None` before trying to get its length.

## A corrected version of the function:
```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from S3 into Redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns is not None and len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options())
    )
```

By incorporating the suggested fix, the corrected function now checks if `self.columns` is not `None` before trying to get its length. This modification ensures that the buggy function can handle the case where `columns` are `None` without raising a `TypeError`.
