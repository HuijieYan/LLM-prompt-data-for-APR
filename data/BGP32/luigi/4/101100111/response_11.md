## Analysis
1. The buggy function `copy` in the `S3CopyToTable` class is responsible for inserting data from S3 into Redshift. It constructs a SQL `COPY` statement based on the table, columns, source, credentials, and options provided.
2. The bug occurs in the line where it constructs the `COPY` statement using string formatting with `{options}` but mistakenly calls the `copy_options` method as `self.copy_options` instead of `self.copy_options()`.
3. Due to this bug, when `copy_options` function is called to provide options for the `COPY` statement, it results in a type error. This relates to the GitHub issue where passing `columns=None` causes the `TypeError: object of type 'NoneType' has no len()`.
4. To fix the bug, the `copy_options` function should be called as a method `self.copy_options()` to retrieve the string options to be included in the `COPY` statement.
5. By correcting this mistake, the bug can be resolved.

## Corrected Version
```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options())
    )
```

By making this correction and calling `self.copy_options()` instead of `self.copy_options`, the bug is fixed, and the function should now properly construct the `COPY` statement without raising any errors, resolving the GitHub issue as well.
