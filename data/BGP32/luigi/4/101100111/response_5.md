The bug in the `copy` function is caused by attempting to get the length of `self.columns` without checking if it is `None`. This leads to a `TypeError` when `columns` is `None`.

To fix this issue:
1. Check if `self.columns` is not `None` before attempting to get its length.
2. Update the line `if len(self.columns) > 0:` to `if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:` to handle the case when `self.columns` is `None`.

Here is the corrected version of the `copy` function:

```python
# The corrected version of the buggy function
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:  # Check if self.columns is not None
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options())
    )
```

By making this change, the `copy` function will now handle the case when `columns` is `None` and prevent the `TypeError` that occurred previously. This correction should address the issue reported on GitHub.
