## Analysis:
1. The buggy function `copy` in the class `S3CopyToTable` is attempting to execute a SQL `COPY` command in Redshift. It builds the command string using values from the class instance and then calls `cursor.execute` to perform the actual execution.

2. The potential error locations in the buggy function are:
   - The condition `if len(self.columns) > 0` could raise an error if `self.columns` is `None`.
   - The usage of `self.copy_options` without calling it as a function could lead to unexpected behavior.

3. Explanation of the bug:
   - The bug originates from the `if len(self.columns) > 0` condition, which assumes that `self.columns` is not `None`. When `self.columns` is `None`, it causes a `TypeError` due to calling `len(None)`.
   - The bug leads to failing the test `test_s3_copy_with_nonetype_columns` because when `columns` are `None`, the condition fails and results in the incorrect behavior.

4. Strategy for fixing the bug:
   - Update the condition `if len(self.columns) > 0` to check if `self.columns` is not `None` before checking its length.
   - Correctly call the method `self.copy_options()` instead of using `self.copy_options` directly in the string concatenation.

5. Corrected version of the function:
```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options())
    )
```

By making the above changes, the corrected function should now pass the failing test and resolve the issue reported on GitHub.
