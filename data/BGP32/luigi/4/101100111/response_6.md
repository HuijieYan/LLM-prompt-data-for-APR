## Analysis:
1. The buggy function `copy` in the `S3CopyToTable` class is trying to construct an SQL query for copying data from S3 to Redshift. It uses the `self.columns` attribute to determine if column names need to be included in the query.
2. The issue lies in the condition `if len(self.columns) > 0`. When `self.columns` is `None`, the code tries to call `len(None)` causing the `TypeError: object of type 'NoneType' has no len()`.
3. The failing test `test_s3_copy_with_nonetype_columns` mocks the necessary objects and expects the SQL query to be constructed correctly without column names.
4. To fix the bug, we need to check if `self.columns` is not `None` before attempting to get its length.
5. Updated code provided below.

## Updated Code:
```python
# The relative path of the updated file: luigi/contrib/redshift.py

# The declaration of the class containing the corrected function
class S3CopyToTable(rdbms.CopyToTable, _CredentialsMixin):
    # This function from the same class is called by the buggy function
    def copy_options(self):
        # Please ignore the body of this function

    # Updated and corrected function
    def copy(self, cursor, f):
        """
        Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

        If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
        """
        logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
        colnames = ''
        if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:
            colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
            colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

        cursor.execute("""
         COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
         CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
         {options}
         ;""".format(
            table=self.table,
            colnames=colnames,
            source=f,
            creds=self._credentials(),
            options=self.copy_options())
        )
```

By including the check `if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0`, we ensure that the code does not try to get the length of `None`. This correction addresses the bug and resolves the issue reported on GitHub.
