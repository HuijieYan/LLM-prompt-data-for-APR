### Bug Explanation:
The bug occurs due to the `self.columns` being `None`, causing the `len()` function to raise a `TypeError`. The `copy_options` function expects `self.columns` to be a list but fails to handle the case when it is `None`.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we should add a check for `self.columns` to handle the case when it is `None`. By performing this check, we can prevent the `TypeError` from occurring and ensure that the `colnames` variable is correctly constructed.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options())
    )
```

By adding the check `if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:`, we prevent the `TypeError` and ensure that `colnames` is constructed correctly. This corrected version should pass the failing test and resolve the GitHub issue.
