## Analysis
The buggy function `copy` in the `S3CopyToTable` class is supposed to execute a `COPY` command in Redshift using the provided parameters. The bug seems to be related to the handling of the `columns` attribute. When `self.columns` is `None`, the buggy function tries to access its length, resulting in a `TypeError`. The issue on GitHub suggests a solution to check if `self.columns` is not `None` before attempting to get its length.

## Bug Explanation
The bug occurs because there is no check for `None` value in the `self.columns` attribute before trying to access its length. This results in a `TypeError` when `self.columns` is `None`.

## Bug Fix
To fix the bug, we need to check if `self.columns` is not `None` before trying to get its length. If `self.columns` is not `None`, then we proceed with getting the column names. Otherwise, we set `colnames` to an empty string.

Below is the corrected version of the `copy` function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options())
    )
```

By making the above change and ensuring that `self.copy_options` is called as a method (`self.copy_options()`), the bug should be fixed and the function should now handle the case where `self.columns` is `None` properly.

This fix aligns with the suggestion provided in the GitHub issue for the same bug.
