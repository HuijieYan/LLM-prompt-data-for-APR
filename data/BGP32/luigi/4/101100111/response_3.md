### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `copy` in the `S3CopyToTable` class is attempting to construct a SQL query for copying data from S3 to Redshift. It relies on `self.columns`, but does not handle the case when `self.columns` is `None`.
2. The failing test is testing the case where `self.columns` is `None`, which leads to an error due to the usage of `len(self.columns)` without checking for `None`.
3. The GitHub issue highlights the exact problem where providing `columns=None` leads to a `TypeError`. The suggested solution is to check `if self.columns` before attempting to get the length.
4. To fix the bug, we need to check if `self.columns` is not `None` before proceeding with constructing the query.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is caused by assuming `self.columns` always has a value without checking if it is `None`. When `columns=None` is passed to `DummyS3CopyToTableKey`, `self.columns` becomes `None`. This leads to a `TypeError` when trying to get the length of `None`.

### Bug Fix:
To fix the bug, we need to check if `self.columns` is not `None` before constructing the SQL query. Here is the corrected version of the `copy` function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options())
    )
```

This fix checks if `self.columns` is not `None` before constructing the `colnames` part of the query, preventing the `TypeError` when `columns=None`.

By applying this fix, the updated function should now pass the failing test and satisfy the expected input/output values for all cases.
