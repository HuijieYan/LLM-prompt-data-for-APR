## Analysis
1. The buggy function `copy` in the `S3CopyToTable` class is responsible for executing a `COPY` command from S3 to Redshift. However, it fails when `self.columns` is `None` due to the attempted `len(None)` operation.
2. The bug is caused by not checking if `self.columns` is `None` before trying to get its length.
3. The failing test case `test_s3_copy_with_nonetype_columns` creates a `DummyS3CopyToTableKey` object with `columns=None`, which leads to the bug during the execution of the `copy` function.
4. To fix the bug, we need to modify the logic to check if `self.columns` is not `None` before proceeding with getting its length for constructing the `colnames` variable.

## Bug Fix
To fix the bug, we need to add a condition to check if `self.columns` is not `None` before constructing the `colnames` variable. Here is the corrected version of the `copy` function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns is not None and len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options())
    )
```

By adding the condition `if self.columns is not None and len(self.columns) > 0`, we ensure that we only construct `colnames` if `self.columns` is not `None`. This fix addresses the bug reported in the GitHub issue.
