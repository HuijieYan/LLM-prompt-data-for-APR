In the buggy function `copy()` of the class `S3CopyToTable`, the issue lies in the following line:

```python
if len(self.columns) > 0:
```

The problem occurs when `self.columns` is `None`, as it is in the failing test case, which raises a `TypeError` since `NoneType` has no `len()` function.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the condition to first check if `self.columns` is not `None` before attempting to get its length.

Here is the corrected version of the `copy()` function:

```python
# Updated copy() function to resolve the bug
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options())
    )
```

By adding `self.columns and` to the `if` condition, we check if `self.columns` is not `None` before proceeding with getting its length, thus avoiding the `TypeError`. 

This correction aligns with the suggested solution in the GitHub issue mentioned. It ensures that the `len()` operation is only performed when `self.columns` is not `None`, preventing the bug from occurring.
