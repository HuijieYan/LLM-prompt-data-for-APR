## Analysis:
1. The buggy function `copy` in the `S3CopyToTable` class is attempting to use the `copy_options` method but incorrectly referencing it as a variable instead of a method call.
2. The bug arises because `self.copy_options` should be `self.copy_options()`.
3. The bug was reported in a GitHub issue related to Redshift COPY failing when columns are not provided. The bug is causing a `TypeError` due to incorrect usage of `self.copy_options`.
4. To fix the bug, we need to call the `copy_options` method correctly by adding parenthesis at the end.

## Corrected Version:
```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options())  # Corrected the function call
    )
``` 

By correcting the function call to `self.copy_options()`, the bug should be fixed, and the function should now correctly execute without issues. This correction should address the reported GitHub issue related to Redshift COPY failures.
