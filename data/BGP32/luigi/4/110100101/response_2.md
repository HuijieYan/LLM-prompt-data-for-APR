The bug in the provided code is that the `columns` attribute of the task is set as `None` which leads to an error in the `copy` function when trying to extract column names from it.

To fix this bug, we need to handle the case where `self.columns` is `None` and provide a fallback mechanism.

Here is the corrected version of the `copy` function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns is not None and len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute(
        """
         COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
         CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
         {options}
         ;""".format(
            table=self.table,
            colnames=colnames,
            source=f,
            creds=self._credentials(),
            options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

This corrected version checks if `self.columns` is not `None` before extracting column names from it.

With this correction, the `copy` function will now handle the case where `self.columns` is `None` and provide an empty string for `colnames` in that scenario.

Now, the function will pass the failing test case provided as it will correctly handle the `columns` attribute being `None`.
