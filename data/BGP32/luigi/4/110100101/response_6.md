### Bug Explanation
The bug in the `copy` function arises from the fact that when `self.columns` is None (as in the test case `DummyS3CopyToTableKey(columns=None)`), the code does not handle this case correctly. This results in trying to call `len(None)` which leads to an AttributeError, causing the function to fail.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug
To fix the bug, we need to handle the case when `self.columns` is None in a way that does not lead to an AttributeError. One approach would be to check if `self.columns` is None and set `colnames` to an empty string in that case before constructing the SQL query.

### Corrected Version of the Function
Here is the corrected version of the `copy` function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns is not None and len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

This corrected version checks if `self.columns` is not None before trying to access its length. If it is None, it sets `colnames` to an empty string, preventing any AttributeError from occurring.
