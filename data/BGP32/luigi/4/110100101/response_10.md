### Analysis:
- The `copy` function within the `S3CopyToTable` class is responsible for copying data from an S3 bucket to a Redshift table.
- The bug seems to be related to the construction of the `COPY` SQL query, specifically handling the `colnames` variable.
- The `colnames` variable is expected to be a comma-separated string of column names, but the current implementation doesn't handle the case where `self.columns` is `None` correctly.
- In the failing test, the `columns` attribute is set to `None`, causing the bug to manifest.

### Bug Cause:
- The bug occurs because the code doesn't check for the case when `self.columns` is `None`, leading to issues with constructing the `colnames` portion of the SQL query.

### Bug Fix:
To fix the bug, we need to handle the case when `self.columns` is `None` by checking for this condition before constructing the `colnames` string in the `copy` function.

### Corrected Version:
```python
    def copy(self, cursor, f):
        """
        Defines copying from s3 into redshift.
    
        If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
        """
        logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
        colnames = ''
        if self.columns is not None:
            colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
            colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)
    
        cursor.execute("""
         COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
         CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
         {options}
         ;""".format(
            table=self.table,
            colnames=colnames,
            source=f,
            creds=self._credentials(),
            options=self.copy_options)
        )
```

By adding the condition `if self.columns is not None:` before constructing `colnames`, we ensure that the code handles the case when `self.columns` is `None` appropriately. This correction should now pass the failing test case provided.
