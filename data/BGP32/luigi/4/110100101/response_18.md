## Bug Analysis
The bug in the `copy` function is that it is not handling the case when `self.columns` is `None` correctly. It tries to iterate over `self.columns` to extract column names, but if `self.columns` is `None`, it results in an error.

The failing test `test_s3_copy_with_nonetype_columns` creates an instance of `DummyS3CopyToTableKey` with `columns` set to `None` and expects the `colnames` variable to be an empty string. However, due to the bug, the function is trying to iterate over `None`, causing an error and not setting `colnames` to an empty string as expected.

## Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to handle the case when `self.columns` is `None` before trying to extract column names from it. We can modify the code to check if `self.columns` is not `None` before constructing the `colnames` string.

## Corrected Version
```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns is not None:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

With this corrected version of the `copy` function, the `colnames` variable will be set to an empty string when `self.columns` is `None`, satisfying the expected behavior in the failing test.
