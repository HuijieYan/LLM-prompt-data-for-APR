The bug in the provided function `copy` is that when `self.columns` is `None`, the code attempts to iterate over it to construct `colnames`, which leads to an error. 

To fix this bug, we can check if `self.columns` is not `None` before constructing `colnames`.

Here is the corrected version of the `copy` function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

This corrected version adds a check `if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:` before trying to construct `colnames`, which will prevent the error when `self.columns` is `None`.

This correction will ensure that the function handles the case when `self.columns` is `None` and passes the provided test case.
