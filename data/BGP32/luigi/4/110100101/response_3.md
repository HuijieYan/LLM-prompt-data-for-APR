### Analysis:
1. The `copy` function in the `S3CopyToTable` class is supposed to execute a `COPY` command in Redshift to copy data from an S3 source.
2. The `colnames` variable is being constructed incorrectly for empty columns, resulting in an extra comma in the SQL query, which causes syntax errors in the `COPY` command.
3. The failing test expects the `colnames` value to be an empty string when `columns` is `None`. However, the current implementation is not handling this case correctly.
4. To fix the bug, we need to adjust the construction of `colnames` to handle the case where `self.columns` is empty.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Check if `self.columns` is empty.
2. If `self.columns` is not empty, construct the `colnames` string as before.
3. If `self.columns` is empty, set `colnames` to an empty string without adding any extra commas.

### Corrected Version of the `copy` function:
```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

By making this correction, the `copy` function will now properly handle the case where `self.columns` is empty, ensuring that the SQL query generated for the `COPY` command is correct. This corrected version should pass the failing test.
