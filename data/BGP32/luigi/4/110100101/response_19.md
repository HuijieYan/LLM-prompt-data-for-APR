### Bug Explanation
The bug in the `copy` function lies in how the `colnames` variable is being constructed. In the buggy code, if the `self.columns` attribute is empty (as is the case when `columns=None` in the failing test), the `colnames` variable is left as an empty string. However, in the formatted SQL query that follows, the `colnames` variable is used without considering the case where it's empty. This leads to an improper SQL statement being generated, causing the test to fail.

### Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to handle the case where `self.columns` is empty differently. If `self.columns` is empty, we should skip adding the `colnames` string in the SQL query.

### Corrected Version
```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    query_template = """
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;"""

    query = query_template.format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options
    )

    cursor.execute(query)
```

By checking if `self.columns` is not empty before constructing the `colnames` variable, we ensure that the SQL query is generated correctly based on the presence or absence of column names. This corrected version should pass the failing test.
