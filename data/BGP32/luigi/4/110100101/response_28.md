The bug in the provided function `copy` is that it fails to properly handle cases where `self.columns` is `None`, resulting in an error when trying to construct the `colnames` string. This causes the test `test_s3_copy_with_nonetype_columns` to fail as it expects an empty string for `colnames` when `self.columns` is `None`.

To fix the bug, we need to check if `self.columns` is `None` before constructing the `colnames` string and set it to an empty string in that case.

Here is the corrected version of the `copy` function:
```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns is not None and len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

With this correction, the `copy` function now properly handles cases where `self.columns` is `None` and constructs the `colnames` string accordingly. The corrected function should pass the failing test `test_s3_copy_with_nonetype_columns` and produce the expected output values for all the provided test cases.
