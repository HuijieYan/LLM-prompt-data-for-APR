## Bug Explanation

The bug in the `copy` function of the `S3CopyToTable` class lies in the way it handles the `colnames` variable. When the `columns` attribute is `None`, the code fails to properly handle this case and attempts to iterate over `self.columns`, leading to an error.

## Bug Fix Strategy

To fix the bug, we need to check if `self.columns` is not `None` before trying to process it. If `self.columns` is `None`, we can set `colnames` to an empty string directly.

## Corrected Version

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    if self.columns is not None:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)
    else:
        colnames = ''

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
``` 

By adding the check `if self.columns is not None` before processing `self.columns`, we ensure that the code handles `None` values correctly and sets `colnames` to an empty string when `columns` is `None`. This corrected version should pass the failing test case.
