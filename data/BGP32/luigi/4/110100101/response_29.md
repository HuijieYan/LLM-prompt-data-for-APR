### Analysis
The buggy function `copy` in the `S3CopyToTable` class from `luigi/contrib/redshift.py` is failing to handle cases where the `columns` attribute is set to `None`. This results in an error when trying to construct the `colnames` variable using a list comprehension. The buggy function is using the list comprehension assuming that `self.columns` will always be a list. 

### Bug Cause
The bug is caused by assuming that `self.columns` will always be a list, leading to an error when trying to iterate over `None`. This causes the `colnames` variable not to be properly constructed, resulting in incorrect SQL syntax when executing the `COPY` command.

### Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to first check if `self.columns` is `None`, and if so, set `colnames` to an empty string. This will ensure that the SQL syntax is correct even when `self.columns` is not provided.

### Corrected Version
Here is the corrected version of the `copy` function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns is not None:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

Now, when `self.columns` is `None`, `colnames` will be set to an empty string, ensuring correct SQL syntax in all cases. This corrected version should pass the failing test case provided.
