## Bug Explanation
The bug in the `copy` function lies in the way it handles the `colnames` variable. When the `columns` attribute is None, the `colnames` variable is not properly handled, resulting in an empty string being passed to the SQL query. This leads to incorrect SQL syntax and causes the test to fail.

## Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to handle the case where `self.columns` is None properly. This can be achieved by checking if `self.columns` is not None before constructing the `colnames` string.

## Corrected Version

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns is not None and len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
``` 

By checking if `self.columns` is not None before constructing `colnames`, we ensure that the `colnames` string will only be created if there are actual columns defined. This will prevent the SQL syntax error and fix the bug.
