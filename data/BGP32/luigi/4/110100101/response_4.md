### Analysis
The buggy function `copy` in the `S3CopyToTable` class is failing to handle the case where `self.columns` is set as `None`. This results in an error when trying to join the column names in the SQL query. The function should check if `self.columns` is `None` before attempting to iterate over it.

### Bug Explanation
The bug occurs because the function is trying to join the column names even when `self.columns` is `None`. This leads to a TypeError when attempting to iterate over a `None` object.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to add a condition to check if `self.columns` is not `None` before joining the column names. If `self.columns` is `None`, then `colnames` should remain an empty string.

### Corrected Version
```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns is not None:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
``` 

By adding the `if self.columns is not None:` condition, we ensure that `colnames` is only populated with the column names if `self.columns` is not `None`. This corrected version should now pass the failing test case provided.
