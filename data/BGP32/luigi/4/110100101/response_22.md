### Explanation:
The buggy function `copy` in the `S3CopyToTable` class is failing to correctly handle the case when `self.columns` is `None`. This causes an issue when trying to construct the `colnames` string to be used in the SQL `COPY` statement.

When `self.columns` is `None`, the buggy code tries to iterate over it to build the `colnames` string, which results in a `TypeError`. This leads to an incorrect SQL query being constructed, causing the test to fail.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to check if `self.columns` is `None` before trying to build the `colnames` string. If it is `None`, we should skip constructing `colnames` to prevent the `TypeError` and correctly handle this scenario.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

With this corrected version, the function will properly handle the case when `self.columns` is `None` and construct the SQL query without any errors.
