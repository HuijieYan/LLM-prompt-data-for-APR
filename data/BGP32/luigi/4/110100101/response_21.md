The bug in the `copy` function is due to the condition `if len(self.columns) > 0:`, where it is checking if the `columns` attribute is not empty before constructing the `colnames` variable. However, in the failing test case, the `columns` attribute is set to `None` which is causing the condition to fail and hence `colnames` remains an empty string, leading to an incorrect SQL statement being formed.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the condition to also check if `self.columns` is not `None` before constructing `colnames`. If `self.columns` is `None`, we should set `colnames` to an empty string as well.

Here is the corrected version of the `copy` function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.
    
    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns is not None and len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

With this correction, the `colnames` variable will be set to an empty string even when `self.columns` is `None`, satisfying the expected input/output values in the failing test case. The function should now execute correctly and pass the failing test.
