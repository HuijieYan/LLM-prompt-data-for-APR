### Analysis:
- The buggy function `copy` in the `S3CopyToTable` class is responsible for copying data from an S3 bucket to a Redshift table.
- The bug seems to be related to how the `colnames` variable is handled and inserted in the SQL query, causing issues when the `columns` attribute is set to `None`.
- The failing test case `test_s3_copy_with_nonetype_columns` creates an instance of `DummyS3CopyToTableKey` with `columns` set to `None` and expects the `colnames` to be an empty string in the SQL query.

### Bug:
- When the `columns` attribute is `None`, the code does not correctly handle building the `colnames` string for the SQL query, resulting in an incorrect query.

### Fix:
- The `colnames` variable should be appropriately handled when `self.columns` is `None`.
- Update the code to check if `self.columns` is not `None` before building `colnames`.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns is not None and len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

By adding the check `if self.columns is not None` before building `colnames`, the corrected version of the function should now properly handle cases where `self.columns` is `None`. This fix should make the function pass the failing test case.
