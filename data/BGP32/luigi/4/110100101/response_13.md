### Analysis
1. The `copy` function in the `S3CopyToTable` class is responsible for copying data from an S3 source to Redshift. The function constructs and executes a SQL `COPY` command.
2. The bug seems to be in the construction of the `colnames` variable. If `self.columns` is `None`, the `colnames` variable is not handled correctly, which may cause issues in the SQL command.
3. The failing test `test_s3_copy_with_nonetype_columns` creates a `DummyS3CopyToTableKey` instance with `columns=None` and runs the `copy` function. It expects an SQL command to be executed with an empty `colnames` field.
4. To fix the bug, we need to handle the case where `self.columns` is `None` properly and ensure that the `colnames` variable is constructed correctly.

### Updated Corrected Version
```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from S3 into Redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

By adding a check for `self.columns` before constructing `colnames`, we ensure that the function handles the case when `self.columns` is `None` properly. This corrected version should pass the failing test `test_s3_copy_with_nonetype_columns` and produce the expected SQL command with an empty `colnames` field.
