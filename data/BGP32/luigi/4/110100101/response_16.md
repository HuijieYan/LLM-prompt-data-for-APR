The bug in the provided `copy(self, cursor, f)` function lies in the way the `colnames` variable is constructed. When `self.columns` is `None`, the `colnames` variable is an empty string `''`, which is correct. However, in the subsequent code block, `colnames` is being overwritten with a comma-separated string of column names, even though `self.columns` is `None`.

To fix this bug, we need to check if `self.columns` is not `None` before constructing the `colnames` string.

Here is the corrected version of the `copy` function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns:
        if len(self.columns) > 0:
            colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
            colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

This corrected version will now properly handle the case where `self.columns` is `None`, and the `colnames` variable will remain an empty string in that scenario.
