### Analysis:
- The buggy function `copy` in the `S3CopyToTable` class is responsible for copying data from an S3 bucket into a Redshift table.
- The bug seems to be related to how the `colnames` variable is handled when the `columns` attribute is `None`.
- The failing test `test_s3_copy_with_nonetype_columns` creates a `DummyS3CopyToTableKey` instance with `columns` set to `None`, which triggers the bug in the `copy` function.
- The expected behavior is that when `columns` is `None`, the `colnames` variable should be an empty string.

### Bug:
- When the `columns` attribute of the task is `None`, the code does not handle this case correctly. This causes a `TypeError` when trying to unpack `None` in the list comprehension used to construct the `colnames` string.

### Fix:
- To fix the bug, we need to check if `self.columns` is `None` before constructing the `colnames` string. If it is `None`, we should set `colnames` to an empty string.
- This can be achieved with a simple conditional check in the code.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
``` 

This corrected version of the `copy` function includes a check to handle the case when `self.columns` is `None`, ensuring that the `colnames` variable is set to an empty string in that scenario.
