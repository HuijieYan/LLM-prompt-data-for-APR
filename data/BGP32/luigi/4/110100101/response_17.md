Potential error locations within the buggy `copy` function:
1. The `columns` attribute is being accessed without proper validation, which could lead to potential issues if it is `None`.
2. The `colnames` variable is being constructed based on the `columns` attribute without handling the case when `columns` is `None`.
3. The `colnames` variable is being used in the `COPY` SQL query without checking if it is empty or not.

Cause of the bug:
The bug occurs because the buggy function does not properly handle the case when the `columns` attribute is `None`. When `columns` is `None`, the function fails to construct the `colnames` variable correctly, leading to an empty string being used in the `COPY` SQL query.

Strategy for fixing the bug:
1. Check if the `columns` attribute is `None` and handle it appropriately by setting `colnames` to an empty string.
2. Update the `COPY` SQL query to dynamically include the `colnames` variable only when it is not empty.

Corrected version of the `copy` function:
```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns is not None and len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

By updating the `copy` function as shown above, it will now handle the case when `columns` is `None` correctly and construct the `colnames` variable accordingly. This corrected version should pass the failing test case provided.
