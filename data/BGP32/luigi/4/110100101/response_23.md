### Bug Analysis
The bug in the `copy` function of the `S3CopyToTable` class is primarily caused by the `colnames` variable not being properly handled when the `columns` attribute is `None`. The function is trying to construct a string of column names from the `columns` attribute which leads to an error when `columns` is `None`.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to check if `self.columns` is `None` before trying to construct the `colnames` string. If `self.columns` is `None`, we should simply skip adding the column names to the `COPY` statement.

### Corrected Version of the Function
```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns is not None:  # Check if columns are not None
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)
    
    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

By adding the check `if self.columns is not None:` before constructing the `colnames` variable, we ensure that the `colnames` string is only created when `self.columns` is not `None`. This should fix the bug and the function should now pass the failing test.
