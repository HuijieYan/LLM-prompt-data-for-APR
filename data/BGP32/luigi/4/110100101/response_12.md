### Analysis
The buggy function `copy` in the `S3CopyToTable` class is failing to handle the case where the `columns` attribute is `None`. This results in an empty string representation of the column names in the `COPY` SQL statement, which causes a mismatch with the expected SQL statement in the test function.

### Bug Explanation
- When the `columns` attribute is `None`, the `colnames` variable remains empty in the buggy function.
- In the test function, the expected SQL statement assumes an empty string for `colnames`, but due to the bug, the actual SQL statement might contain `NULL`, leading to a failing test.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to handle the case where `columns` is `None` in the `copy` function. We should ensure that when `columns` is `None`, the `colnames` variable is set to an empty string.

### Corrected Version
```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.
    
    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns is not None and len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

By adding a check to ensure that `self.columns` is not `None` before processing it, we prevent the `colnames` variable from being empty if `columns` is `None`. This correction should now pass the failing test case.
