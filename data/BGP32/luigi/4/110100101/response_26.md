### Analysis
The buggy function `copy` in the `S3CopyToTable` class is responsible for copying data from an S3 bucket into a Redshift table. The bug seems to be related to the handling of column names (`colnames`). In the failing test case, the `columns` attribute of the task is set to `None`, which leads to `colnames` being an empty string. However, the buggy function does not handle the case when `self.columns` is `None`, which results in an error when trying to format the SQL query.

### Bug
The bug occurs when `self.columns` is `None`, leading to an error in the string formatting part where `colnames` is expected to be a list of column names but is actually an empty string.

### Fix
We need to add a conditional check to handle the case when `self.columns` is `None` and set `colnames` accordingly.

### Corrected Version
```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    
    if self.columns is not None:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)
    else:
        colnames = ''
    
    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

This corrected version includes a check for `self.columns` being `None` and sets `colnames` to an empty string in that case. This should fix the bug and allow the function to handle cases where column names are not provided.
