## Analysis:
The buggy function `copy(self, cursor, f)` in the `S3CopyToTable` class has a bug in the way it constructs the SQL query string in the `cursor.execute()` call. The function is not calling the `copy_options()` function correctly to include additional copy options in the SQL query.

## Issue:
The bug is in this line:
```python
options=self.copy_options)
```
where `self.copy_options` should be a function call `self.copy_options()` to get the result of the function and include it in the SQL query.

## Bug Cause:
The bug is caused by attempting to pass a function reference `self.copy_options` directly as a parameter to the SQL query string, instead of calling the function `self.copy_options()` to get the result and include it in the SQL query. This causes the `options` part of the SQL query to be incorrect or missing.

## Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to call the `copy_options` method to retrieve the options string and include it in the dynamic SQL query string correctly.

## Corrected Version:
```python
# fix for the buggy function
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options())
    )
```

By making the change above, the `copy_options()` function will be correctly called, and the options will be included in the SQL query when executing the `COPY` command.
