## Analysis:
The buggy function `copy` in the `S3CopyToTable` class is trying to execute a `COPY` command in Redshift using the provided parameters. The bug seems to be in the way the `copy_options` function is being called within the `cursor.execute` statement. It is missing parentheses to actually call the function and append its result to the SQL query.

## Cause of the Bug:
The bug is caused by not calling the `copy_options` function correctly. As a result, the options from the function are not being included in the `COPY` command, leading to an incomplete SQL query.

## Bug Fix Strategy:
The bug can be fixed by ensuring that the `copy_options` function is called properly and its result is appended to the SQL query before executing the `COPY` command.

## Corrected Version:
```python
    def copy(self, cursor, f):
        """
        Defines copying from s3 into redshift.
    
        If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
        """
        logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
        colnames = ''
        if len(self.columns) > 0:
            colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
            colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)
    
        cursor.execute("""
         COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
         CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
         {options}
         ;""".format(
            table=self.table,
            colnames=colnames,
            source=f,
            creds=self._credentials(),
            options=self.copy_options())
        )
```

Now, the corrected version of the `copy` function correctly calls the `copy_options` function within the `cursor.execute` statement, resolving the bug.
