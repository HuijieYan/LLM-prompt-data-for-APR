### Analysis:
- The buggy function `copy` is responsible for executing a `COPY` command from an S3 source to a Redshift table.
- The `copy` function uses string formatting to build the SQL query, incorporating table name, column names, source, credentials, and options.
- There is an issue with how the `copy_options` function is being referenced in the `cursor.execute` call.

### Error:
- The `self.copy_options` should be a function call `self.copy_options()` instead of just referencing the function object itself.
- This leads to passing a function object instead of the actual query options, causing the `COPY` command to fail.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
- Update the `cursor.execute` call to include the function call `self.copy_options()` to retrieve the actual options for the `COPY` command.

### Corrected Version:
```python
# Corrected version of the buggy function
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options())
    )
```

By making this change, the `copy_options` function will be correctly called to fetch the options needed for the `COPY` command, fixing the bug in the function.
