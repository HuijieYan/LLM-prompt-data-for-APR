## Analysis:
- The buggy function `copy` in the `S3CopyToTable` class is supposed to execute a `COPY` command in Redshift using the provided parameters.
- The bug seems to be in the `cursor.execute` statement where `self.copy_options` is not being called properly.
- The failing test `test_s3_copy_with_nonetype_columns` sets the `columns` parameter of `DummyS3CopyToTableKey` to `None`, which triggers the bug when the `copy` function is called.

## Bug Cause:
- In the buggy function `copy`, the `self.copy_options` is not being executed as a function call, causing the `options` parameter in the `COPY` command to be set incorrectly.

## Bug Fix:
- Modify the `copy` function to properly call `self.copy_options()` to generate the `options` string.
- Ensure that the `colnames` string is handled correctly when `self.columns` is empty.

## Corrected Version:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options())
    )
```

By making the changes outlined above, the corrected version of the `copy` function should now properly execute the `COPY` command in Redshift and pass the failing test.
