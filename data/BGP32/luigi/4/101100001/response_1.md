### Analysis:
1. The `S3CopyToTable` class contains a `copy` function that is intended to copy data from S3 to Redshift.
2. The `copy` function constructs a SQL `COPY` statement using input parameters.
3. The `copy_options` function is expected to provide additional copy options, but it is not correctly called in the `copy` function.
4. The bug is in the line `options=self.copy_options)`, where `self.copy_options` is missing parentheses to actually call the function.

### Bug Cause:
The bug in the `copy` function lies in the incorrect way of calling the `copy_options` function. As a result, the copy options are not properly included in the constructed SQL statement. This leads to incorrect behavior when copying data from S3 to Redshift.

### Bug Fix:
To fix the bug, we need to call the `copy_options` function correctly by adding `()`. This will invoke the function and include its return value in the SQL statement.

### Corrected Version:
```python
    def copy(self, cursor, f):
        """
        Defines copying from s3 into redshift.
    
        If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
        """
        logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
        colnames = ''
        if len(self.columns) > 0:
            colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
            colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)
    
        cursor.execute("""
         COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
         CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
         {options}
         ;""".format(
            table=self.table,
            colnames=colnames,
            source=f,
            creds=self._credentials(),
            options=self.copy_options())  # Corrected the function call by adding ()
        )
```

After making this correction, the `copy` function should construct the SQL statement correctly with the copy options included, fixing the bug.
