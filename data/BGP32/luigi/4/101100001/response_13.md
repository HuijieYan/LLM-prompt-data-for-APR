## Analysis:
The buggy function `copy` within the `S3CopyToTable` class is failing because it is not calling the `copy_options` function correctly. The `copy_options` function should be called to get the options for the `COPY` statement in Redshift, but in the buggy version, it is not being invoked properly.

## Bug Cause:
The bug is caused by not calling the `copy_options` function correctly within the `copy` function. This leads to missing options in the `COPY` statement, causing the test to fail.

## Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to properly invoke the `copy_options` function within the `COPY` statement. The correct way to call a function is by using parentheses `()` after the function name.

## Corrected Version:
```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options())
    )
```

In the corrected version, I have added parentheses `()` after `self.copy_options` to properly call the `copy_options` function and include the options in the `COPY` statement. This fix should address the bug and make the test pass.
