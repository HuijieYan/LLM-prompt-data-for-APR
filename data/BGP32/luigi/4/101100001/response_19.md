## Analysis:
The buggy function `copy` within the `S3CopyToTable` class is failing to execute the `copy_options` function correctly. It is not calling the function by adding parentheses, which results in passing the function object itself to the execute method instead of its return value.

## Identified Issue:
The main issue in the buggy function is that `self.copy_options` should be `self.copy_options()` in the `cursor.execute` statement to actually call the function and retrieve its return value.

## Bug Cause:
The bug occurs because the buggy function is passing the function object `self.copy_options` directly to the `cursor.execute` method instead of calling the function to get the actual options.

## Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to call the `copy_options` function to get the desired options string before passing it to the `cursor.execute` method.

## Corrected Version:
```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options())
    )
```

By correcting this issue and calling `self.copy_options()` in the `cursor.execute` statement, the bug should be fixed. This corrected version of the function should now pass the failing test provided.
