### Analysis:
1. The `copy` function within the `S3CopyToTable` class from the `luigi/contrib/redshift.py` file is supposed to define copying from S3 into Redshift.
2. The buggy function attempts to execute a SQL `COPY` command using provided parameters such as table name, column names, source location, credentials, and additional options.
3. The bug seems to be related to the `options=self.copy_options` part in the `cursor.execute` call, where `self.copy_options` is being passed incorrectly as a function object without calling it.
4. The function should be calling `self.copy_options()` to get the actual options string based on the implementation of the `copy_options` function within the same class.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is caused by passing the `copy_options` function as an object without calling it, which results in incorrect SQL execution due to the absence of the desired options in the `COPY` command.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the `copy_options` function is called to retrieve the options string and properly include it in the SQL command.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from S3 into Redshift.
    
    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)
    
    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options())
    )
```

By making this correction and calling `self.copy_options()` in the `cursor.execute` call, the bug should be resolved, and the corrected version of the function should pass the failing test.
