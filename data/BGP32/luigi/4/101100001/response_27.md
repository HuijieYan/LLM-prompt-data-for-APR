### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `copy` in the class `S3CopyToTable` is intended to execute a `COPY` command in Redshift using the provided parameters.
2. The bug is likely in the `cursor.execute` statement where the `options` parameter is incorrectly passed as a function object `self.copy_options` instead of calling the function `self.copy_options()` to retrieve the options string.
3. This bug causes the SQL query to include the function object `self.copy_options` directly instead of the actual options string, leading to a syntax error.
4. To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the `self.copy_options` function is called to retrieve the options string before inserting it into the SQL query.
5. I will provide a corrected version of the `copy` function below.

### Proposed Fix:
```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options())
    )

```

By making the change from `options=self.copy_options` to `options=self.copy_options()`, we ensure that the `copy_options` function is correctly called to retrieve the options string before inserting it into the query. This correction should fix the bug and allow the function to execute the `COPY` command as intended.
