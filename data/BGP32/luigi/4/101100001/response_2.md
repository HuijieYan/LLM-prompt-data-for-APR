### Analysis:
1. The `copy` function in the `S3CopyToTable` class is responsible for copying data from an S3 source to a Redshift table.
2. The bug seems to be in the way the `self.copy_options` method is being called within the SQL query string. It should be a method call, but it is treated as a property.
3. This bug causes the `options` part of the SQL query to be set to `self.copy_options` instead of the actual output from `self.copy_options()`.
4. To fix the bug, we need to ensure that `self.copy_options()` is called to get the actual options value.
5. Another issue is that the `colnames` variable is not properly formatted with parentheses.
6. We need to fix the way `colnames` is formatted and ensure `self.copy_options()` is called to get the correct options string.

### Updated and Corrected Function:
```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames) if colnames else ''
    
    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options())
    )
```

By making the above corrections, the function should now properly execute the SQL `COPY` query with the correct options passed from the `copy_options` method. This corrected version should pass the failing test.
