The bug in the `copy` function is due to not properly calling the `copy_options` method. The `copy_options` method is not being invoked as a method since it is missing the parentheses `()`. As a result, the `options=self.copy_options` line in the `cursor.execute` call is assigning the method itself, not the result of calling the method. This causes the `COPY` command to have an incorrect parameter for `options` in the SQL query.

To fix this bug, the `copy_options` method needs to be correctly called by adding parentheses `()` after the method name in the `cursor.execute` call.

Here is the corrected version of the `copy` function:

```python
    def copy(self, cursor, f):
        """
        Defines copying from s3 into redshift.
    
        If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
        """
        logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
        colnames = ''
        if len(self.columns) > 0:
            colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
            colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)
    
        cursor.execute("""
         COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
         CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
         {options}
         ;""".format(
            table=self.table,
            colnames=colnames,
            source=f,
            creds=self._credentials(),
            options=self.copy_options())  # Corrected the call to copy_options by adding ()
        )
```

By making this change, the `copy` function will now correctly call the `copy_options` method and include the result in the `options` parameter of the `COPY` command in the SQL query. This should address the bug and make the function behave as expected.
