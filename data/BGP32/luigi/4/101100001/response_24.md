## Analysis:
The buggy function `copy(self, cursor, f)` in the `S3CopyToTable` class of `luigi.contrib.redshift` is failing the test because the `copy_options` function is not being called correctly within the `cursor.execute` statement.

## Error Location:
The issue lies in how the `copy_options` function is being included in the `cursor.execute` statement. It should be called as a method `self.copy_options()` instead of just `self.copy_options`.

## Bug Explanation:
The bug is causing the `copy_options` method to not be executed and included correctly in the SQL query. This results in incomplete SQL queries which fail to meet the test expectations.

## Fix Strategy:
The `copy_options` method needs to be called as a function `self.copy_options()` to return the necessary options for the SQL query. By correcting this, the SQL query will be constructed correctly and pass the test.

## Corrected Version:
```python
# The corrected buggy function
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options())
    )
``` 

By making this correction, the `copy` function in the `S3CopyToTable` class will now call the `copy_options` method correctly, construct the SQL query properly, and pass the failing test.
