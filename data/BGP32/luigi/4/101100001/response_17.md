## Analysis:
- The `copy` function in the `S3CopyToTable` class is supposed to execute a `COPY` command to copy data from S3 into Redshift.
- The bug seems to be in the way `self.copy_options` is being used in the `COPY` command string.
- The test function is mocking the `RedshiftTarget` object and setting expectations on the `execute` method of the cursor that the `copy` function uses.

## Bug:
The bug in the `copy` function is with the line where `self.copy_options` is used. The function call is missing parentheses `()` at the end, causing an issue with string formatting.

## Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
1. Update the line `options=self.copy_options)` to `options=self.copy_options()`. This will properly call the `copy_options` function.
2. Verify that all the other parameters in the `COPY` command string are correctly formatted.

## Corrected Version:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from S3 into Redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options())
    )
```

With this change, the `copy` function should now properly execute the `COPY` command with the correct options.
