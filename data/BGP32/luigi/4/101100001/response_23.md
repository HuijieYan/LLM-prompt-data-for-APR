The bug in the provided `copy` function is with the line:
```python
options=self.copy_options)
```

This line is referencing the `copy_options` method without actually invoking it. The correct way to call the `copy_options` method is `self.copy_options()`. 

Here is the corrected version of the `copy` function:
```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options())
    )
```

By adding the `()` after `self.copy_options`, we are properly invoking the `copy_options` method.

This corrected version should now pass the failing test.
