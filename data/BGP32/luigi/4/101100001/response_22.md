## Analysis:
The buggy function `copy(self, cursor, f)` in the `S3CopyToTable` class is supposed to execute a `COPY` command in Redshift using the provided parameters. However, there are several issues in the implementation:
1. The `copy_options` function is not being called correctly. It should be `self.copy_options()`, with parentheses to execute the function.
2. The `COPY` SQL statement is missing placeholders for the actual values to be inserted.

## Bug Cause:
The bug is caused by not calling the `copy_options` function correctly and failing to provide actual values for placeholders in the `COPY` SQL statement.

## Fix Strategy:
1. Call `self.copy_options()` to get the actual options for the `COPY` command.
2. Replace the placeholders in the `COPY` SQL statement with actual values.

## Corrected Version:
```python
# The corrected version of the buggy function
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options())
    )
```

By making these corrections, the `copy` function should now properly call `copy_options` and execute the `COPY` command with the actual values in the SQL statement, resolving the bug.
