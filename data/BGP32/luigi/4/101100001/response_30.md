## Analysis:
The buggy function `copy` in the `S3CopyToTable` class has an issue with the way `copy_options` function is called inside the `cursor.execute` statement. The `copy_options` function is not being called correctly, resulting in potential errors when executing the SQL query.

## Potential Error:
The line `options=self.copy_options)` is trying to pass the `copy_options` function itself as a parameter to the string formatting method in the `cursor.execute` statement. This will not execute the `copy_options` function and will likely result in a TypeError when running the SQL query.

## Cause of the Bug:
The bug is caused by passing the function `copy_options` directly instead of calling it to get the desired options string. This leads to incorrect formatting of the SQL query and potential runtime errors.

## Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, the `copy_options` function needs to be called to retrieve the options string before passing it to the `cursor.execute` statement. This can be done by adding parentheses `()` after `copy_options` to call the function and get the actual options string.

## Corrected Version:
```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options())  # Call the copy_options function to get the options string
    )
```

By making this change, the `copy` function should now correctly execute the SQL query with the options obtained from the `copy_options` function, fixing the bug and allowing the test `test_s3_copy_with_nonetype_columns` to pass successfully.
