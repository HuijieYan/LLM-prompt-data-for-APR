## Analysis:
- The buggy function is `copy` within the class `S3CopyToTable` in the `luigi.contrib.redshift.py` file.
- The function uses string formatting to construct a SQL query for copying data from S3 to Redshift.
- The issue seems to be with how the `options` parameter is being passed in the `cursor.execute()` call.
- The failing test `test_s3_copy_with_nonetype_columns` checks if the `COPY` query is being executed correctly with the proper formatting.

## Bug:
- The bug lies in the way `self.copy_options` is being passed as a part of the `cursor.execute()` call in the `copy` function.
- At the end of the string formatting, `self.copy_options` is mistakenly used as a function reference rather than invoking the function to get the actual options.

## Fix:
- To fix the bug, we need to correctly invoke the `copy_options()` function to get the options string that needs to be included in the `COPY` query.

## Corrected Version:
```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options())
    )
```

By making this change, the `copy_options` function will now correctly provide the options string needed for the `COPY` query, resolving the bug.
