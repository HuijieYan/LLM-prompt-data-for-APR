### Analysis:
The buggy function `copy` within the `S3CopyToTable` class in the `luigi/contrib/redshift.py` file is not correctly formatting the `COPY` statement for transferring data from S3 to Redshift. The issue seems to be with how the `colnames` variable is handled when there are no columns provided.

### Error Location:
The error is likely occurring when the `colnames` variable is being formatted, as it is being treated as a string even when it is empty.

### Cause of the Bug:
The bug is caused by the incorrect handling of the `colnames` variable when it is empty. This causes the `COPY` statement to have an empty set of column names in the `colnames` section, which is not valid SQL syntax.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to properly handle the case when `colnames` is empty. We should only include the column names section in the `COPY` statement if there are actual column names present.

### Corrected Version:
Here is the corrected version of the `copy` function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options())
    )
```

In the corrected version:
- We check if `self.columns` is not empty before formatting `colnames`.
- We call `self.copy_options()` to actually execute the function and get the options in the correct format.

This corrected version should now properly handle the case when there are no columns provided and pass the failing test.
