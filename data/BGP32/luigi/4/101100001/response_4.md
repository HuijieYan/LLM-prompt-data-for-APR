## Analysis:
1. The `copy` function in the `S3CopyToTable` class is responsible for executing a `COPY` command in Redshift from an S3 location.
2. The bug in the code is related to passing the `copy_options` function as a parameter in the string formatting of the SQL query, but the function is not being called.
3. The `copy_options` function should be invoked to provide additional options needed for the `COPY` command.
4. The fix involves calling the `copy_options` function in the string formatting to include the options in the `COPY` command.
5. The corrected code is provided below:

## Corrected Version:
```python
# The corrected version of the buggy function
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options())
    )
```

By calling `self.copy_options()` in the string formatting, the `copy_options` function will be executed, providing the necessary options for the `COPY` command.
