## Analysis:

1. The buggy function is `copy()` within the `S3CopyToTable` class in the `luigi/contrib/redshift.py` file.
2. The function is supposed to execute a `COPY` command to copy data from S3 into Redshift. It constructs the SQL query using provided parameters.
3. The bug seems to be in how the `copy_options` method is being called within the string formatting of the SQL query. The `copy_options` method needs to be called as a function `copy_options()`.
4. The bug causes the `copy()` function to have incorrect SQL syntax due to the missing parentheses when calling `copy_options`.
5. We need to correct the string formatting in the `cursor.execute()` call of the `copy()` method.

## Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
- Modify the `cursor.execute()` call in the `copy()` method to correctly call the `copy_options()` method by adding `()` at the end to invoke the function.

## Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from S3 into Redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)
    
    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options())
    )
``` 

By adding `()` to `self.copy_options` in the `cursor.execute()` call, the `copy_options()` method will be correctly called and the bug should be fixed.
