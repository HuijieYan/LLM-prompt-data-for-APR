## Analysis:
1. The buggy function `copy` in the `S3CopyToTable` class is responsible for executing a `COPY` command from S3 to Redshift.
2. The main issue in the buggy function seems to be with the way `copy_options` function is invoked. 
3. The failing test `test_s3_copy_with_nonetype_columns` checks if the correct `COPY` command is executed with the expected parameters, including the `colnames` being empty.
4. To fix the bug, we need to correctly call the `copy_options` function to get the copy options string.
5. Currently, the `options=self.copy_options` in the `cursor.execute` call should be changed to `options=self.copy_options()`

## Corrected Version:
```python
# The corrected version of the buggy function
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options())
    )
```

By making the change `options=self.copy_options()` in the `cursor.execute` call, the corrected version of the function should now correctly execute the `COPY` command with the copy options included.
