## Analysis:
1. The `copy` function in the `S3CopyToTable` class is supposed to execute a `COPY` command to copy data from S3 into Redshift.
2. In the buggy function, the `copy_options` method is not being called correctly to retrieve the copy options.
3. The bug seems to be in how `self.copy_options` is being used in the `cursor.execute` statement, as it should be a method call, not just a reference to the method itself.
4. To fix the bug, we need to call the `copy_options` method to get the actual copy options string to pass to the `cursor.execute` statement.

## Correction:

```python
class S3CopyToTable(rdbms.CopyToTable, _CredentialsMixin):
    def copy_options(self):
        # Please ignore the body of this function

    def copy(self, cursor, f):
        """
        Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

        If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
        """
        logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
        colnames = ''
        if len(self.columns) > 0:
            colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
            colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

        cursor.execute("""
         COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
         CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
         {options}
         ;""".format(
            table=self.table,
            colnames=colnames,
            source=f,
            creds=self._credentials(),
            options=self.copy_options())
        )
```

By making the correction highlighted above, the `copy` function will call the `copy_options` method correctly before executing the `COPY` command.

This corrected version should pass the failing test provided.
