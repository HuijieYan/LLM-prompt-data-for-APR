## Analysis:
The buggy function `copy` in the `S3CopyToTable` class is not correctly formatting the `COPY` SQL statement. The issue lies in the way the `copy_options` function is being called within the `cursor.execure` statement. The `copy_options` function is a method of the class, but it needs to be called as a method by using `self.copy_options()` instead of `self.copy_options`. Additionally, the `colnames` variable needs to handle cases where the `self.columns` list is empty.

## Bug Cause:
The bug is caused by missing parentheses when calling the `copy_options` function and improperly handling the `colnames` variable when there are no columns specified.

## Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
1. Update the `copy` function to call `self.copy_options()` when formatting the `COPY` SQL statement.
2. Update the `colnames` variable assignment to properly handle cases where `self.columns` is empty.

## Corrected Version:
```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options())
    )
```

By making the above changes, the corrected version of the `copy` function should now properly format the `COPY` SQL statement and handle cases where no columns are specified. This corrected version should pass the failing test.
