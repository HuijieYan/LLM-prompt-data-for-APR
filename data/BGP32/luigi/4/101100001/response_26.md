## Analysis:
1. The buggy function `copy` in the `S3CopyToTable` class is responsible for executing a COPY command in Redshift from an S3 source. It constructs the SQL query based on the provided parameters.
2. The bug appears to be in how the `copy_options` function is being called within the `copy` function. 
3. The failing test is checking if the constructed SQL query matches the expected format, including the indentation.
4. To fix the bug, we need to call the `copy_options` function correctly to get the necessary options string.
5. The corrected version of the function is provided below:

## Corrected Version:
```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options())
    )
```

By correcting the call to the `copy_options` function in the `cursor.execute` statement to `self.copy_options()`, the bug should be fixed and the function should now correctly construct the SQL query for copying data from S3 to Redshift.

This correction should make the function work as expected and pass the failing test.
