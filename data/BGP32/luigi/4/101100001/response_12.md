### Analysis:
The buggy function `copy(self, cursor, f)` is supposed to execute a `COPY` statement to copy data from S3 into Redshift. However, there are a couple of issues in the implementation:
1. The `colnames` variable is not handled properly when there are no columns provided.
2. The `copy_options` method is not being called correctly in the `COPY` statement generation.
3. The `colnames` should be inserted with parenthesis only if columns are provided.

### Bug Cause:
- The buggy function fails because of incorrect handling of column names when no columns are provided. This causes an issue in the syntax of the generated `COPY` statement.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
1. Check if there are columns provided before constructing the `colnames` string.
2. Properly call the `copy_options` method to include the appropriate copy options in the `COPY` statement.
3. Adjust the formatting of the `colnames` variable to include parenthesis only when necessary.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames) if colnames else ''

    copy_options = self.copy_options()

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=copy_options)
    )
```

After making these corrections, the buggy function should now correctly handle cases where no columns are provided and include `copy_options` properly in the `COPY` statement. This corrected version should pass the failing test.
