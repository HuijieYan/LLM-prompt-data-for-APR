## Analysis
The buggy function `copy` in the `luigi/contrib/redshift.py` file fails when the `self.columns` attribute is `None`. This is because the code attempts to check the length of `self.columns` without considering the case where it might be `None`, leading to a `TypeError`. The expected behavior is to handle the scenario where `self.columns` is `None` gracefully.

## Bug Cause
The bug is caused by attempting to check the length of `self.columns` without verifying if it is `None`.

## Bug Fix
To fix the bug, we need to handle the scenario where `self.columns` is `None` by adding a check before trying to access the length. This check can be done by using `if self.columns is not None` before checking the length.

## Corrected Version

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns is not None and len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

By adding the check `if self.columns is not None` before accessing the length of `self.columns`, we ensure that the code handles the case where `self.columns` is `None` gracefully. This corrected version should pass the failing test case and fulfill the expected input/output values.
