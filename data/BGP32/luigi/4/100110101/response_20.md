The bug in the provided function `copy()` arises from comparing the length of a `NoneType` object (`self.columns`) using `len()`. This results in a `TypeError: object of type 'NoneType' has no len()` when the function is called with `columns=None`.

To fix the bug, a simple check can be added before attempting to access the length of `self.columns` to handle the case when `columns` is `None`.

Here is the corrected version of the `copy()` function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns is not None and len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

This updated version checks if `self.columns` is not `None` before attempting to access its length.

With this fix, the function should now handle the case where `columns` is `None` without throwing a `TypeError`.
