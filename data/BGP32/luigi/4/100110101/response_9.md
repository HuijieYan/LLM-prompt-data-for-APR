The bug in the provided function arises from the fact that the `columns` attribute can be `None` in the `DummyS3CopyToTableKey` object. When the function checks the length of `self.columns`, which is `None`, it results in a `TypeError` because `NoneType` does not have a `len()` method.

To fix this bug, we need to handle the case where `self.columns` is `None` before attempting to get the length of it. We can do this by checking if `self.columns` is `None` before processing it.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns is not None:  # Check if self.columns is not None
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

With this correction, the function will handle the case where `self.columns` is `None` and avoid attempting to get its length. This change should resolve the `TypeError` issue and make the function pass the failing test.
