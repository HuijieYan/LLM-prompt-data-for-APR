### Bug Explanation
The bug in the `copy` function occurs because the code is trying to check the length of `self.columns` without handling the case where `self.columns` is None. This results in a `TypeError` when trying to call `len()` on a `NoneType` object.

### Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to add a condition to check if `self.columns` is not None before trying to get its length. If `self.columns` is None, we can set `colnames` to an empty string directly.

### Corrected Version
```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''

    if self.columns is not None:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
``` 

By adding the `if self.columns is not None:` check, we ensure that `colnames` is only generated when `self.columns` is not None, avoiding the `TypeError` that was occurring.
