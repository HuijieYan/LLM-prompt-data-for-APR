The bug in the provided code is caused by the `self.columns` variable being `None` and trying to check its length using `len(self.columns)`. This results in a `TypeError: object of type 'NoneType' has no len()`.

To fix this bug, we can check if `self.columns` is `None` before trying to get its length. If it is `None`, we can set `colnames` to an empty string directly.

Here is the corrected version of the `copy` function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns is not None:  # Check if self.columns is not None
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

With this correction, the function will now handle the case where `self.columns` is `None` without raising an error and will set `colnames` to an empty string in that scenario. This change should make the function work correctly with the provided test case and satisfy the expected input/output values.
