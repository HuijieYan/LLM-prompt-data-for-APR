### Analysis:
The buggy function `copy` is failing because it is trying to check the length of `self.columns`, which is None. This causes a `TypeError` since you cannot get the length of a NoneType object.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is caused by the `if len(self.columns) > 0` line, where it is trying to get the length of `self.columns`, but `self.columns` is `None` in the `DummyS3CopyToTableKey` object.

### Fix:
To fix this bug, we need to handle the case where `self.columns` is `None` before attempting to get its length. We can use an `if self.columns` check to avoid the `TypeError`.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

This corrected version includes a check `if self.columns` before trying to get the length, preventing the `TypeError` when `self.columns` is `None`.
