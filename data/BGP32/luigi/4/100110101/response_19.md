### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `copy` is trying to access the length of `self.columns` without handling the case where `self.columns` could be `None`.
2. The failing test is passing `columns` as `None` to the `DummyS3CopyToTableKey` object, causing the `TypeError` when checking the length of `self.columns`.
3. The error message shows that an object of type `NoneType` has no `len()`, which occurs at line 338 in the `copy` function.
4. To fix the bug, we need to check if `self.columns` is `None` before trying to access its length.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Add a check for `None` before trying to access the length of `self.columns`.
2. If `self.columns` is not `None`, then proceed with extracting column names.
3. Update the logic to handle the case when `self.columns` is `None`.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns is not None:  # Check if self.columns is not None
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
``` 

This corrected version includes the check for `None` before accessing the length of `self.columns`, ensuring that the function does not throw a `TypeError` when `self.columns` is `None`.
