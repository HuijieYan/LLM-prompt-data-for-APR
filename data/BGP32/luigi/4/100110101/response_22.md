### Strategy for Fixing the Bug
The current bug occurs because the function is trying to check the length of `self.columns`, which is assigned as `None` in the test case. To fix this bug, we need to handle the case where `self.columns` is `None` before trying to get its length. We can do this by checking if `self.columns` is not `None` before attempting to get its length.

### Corrected Version of the Buggy Function
```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns is not None:  # Added a check for None
        if len(self.columns) > 0:
            colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
            colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

By adding a check for `self.columns is not None`, we ensure that the buggy function won't try to get the length of `self.columns` when it is `None`. This correction should fix the TypeError caused by the original bug and make the function handle `None` values in `self.columns` properly.
