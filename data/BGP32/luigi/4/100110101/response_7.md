The bug in the provided function `copy` arises from the use of `self.columns` without checking if it is None or not before attempting to get its length.

### Analysis:
- The function `copy` is designed to copy data from S3 into Redshift. It constructs a SQL `COPY` statement based on various parameters including `colnames` which is derived from `self.columns`.
- The failing test `test_s3_copy_with_nonetype_columns` mocks a `RedshiftTarget` object and tests the behavior when the `columns` parameter of the task is set to None.
- The error message indicates a `TypeError` due to attempting to get the length of a NoneType object in the `if len(self.columns) > 0:` line inside the `copy` function.

### Bug Cause:
- When `self.columns` is set to None, the function tries to get the length of a NoneType object, resulting in a `TypeError`.

### Strategy for fixing the bug:
- Check if `self.columns` is not None before attempting to process its length.

### Corrected function:
```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns is not None and len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

By adding the condition `if self.columns is not None and len(self.columns) > 0` before processing `self.columns`, we ensure that we only operate on it if it is not None. This modification will prevent the `TypeError` and should fix the bug.
