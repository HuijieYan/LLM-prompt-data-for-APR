The bug in the provided function `copy` arises from the condition `if len(self.columns) > 0:` where the `self.columns` is checked for its length without handling the case where it might be `None`.

To fix this bug, we should first check if `self.columns` is not `None` before checking its length. This can be done by adding a condition `if self.columns is not None and len(self.columns) > 0:`. This way, even if `self.columns` is `None`, the length check will not be performed and the code will not throw a `TypeError`.

Here is the corrected version of the `copy` function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns is not None and len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

With this correction, the function will properly handle the case where `self.columns` is `None`, and the test case `test_s3_copy_with_nonetype_columns` should pass without any `TypeError`.
