### Bug Explanation
In the provided buggy function, the bug occurs due to a check on the `self.columns` attribute using `len()` without considering the possibility that `self.columns` could be `None`. This leads to a `TypeError` when `self.columns` is `None` and the code tries to check its length.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to modify the condition checking `self.columns` to first ensure that it is not `None` before checking its length. We can use an `if` statement to handle this scenario.

### Corrected Function

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns is not None and len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

By adding the condition `if self.columns is not None and len(self.columns) > 0:` before trying to access the length of `self.columns`, we address the bug. This ensures that the code will only attempt to check the length of `self.columns` if it is not `None`.
