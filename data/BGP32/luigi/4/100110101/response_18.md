The bug in the provided code is caused by trying to call `len()` on a `None` type object in the `copy` function. This occurs when the `columns` attribute is `None`.

To fix this bug, we need to handle the case where `self.columns` is `None` before trying to access its length.

Here is the corrected version of the `copy` function:

```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: luigi/contrib/redshift.py

def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:  # Check if self.columns is not None before accessing length
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

With this correction, the function will now handle the case when `self.columns` is `None`.

This corrected version should pass the failing test and satisfy the expected input/output values.
