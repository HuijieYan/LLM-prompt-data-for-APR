The issue in the provided code is that the `columns` attribute of `self` is being checked for its length without handling the case when it is `None`. This results in a `TypeError: object of type 'NoneType' has no len()` when trying to access the length of `None`.

To fix this issue, we need to add a check for `None` before checking the length of `self.columns`.

Here is the corrected version of the `copy` function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns is not None and len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

This corrected version includes a check for `None` before accessing the length of `self.columns` to avoid the `TypeError`.

With this correction, the function should now pass the failing test case provided.
