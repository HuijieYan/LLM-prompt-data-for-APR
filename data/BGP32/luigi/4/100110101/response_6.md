### Analysis
From the error message, we can see that the buggy function is trying to access the length of `self.columns`, which is a `NoneType` object in the test case. This causes a `TypeError` because objects of type `NoneType` do not have a `len()` function.

### Bug Cause
The root cause of the bug is that when `self.columns` is `None`, the buggy function tries to check its length, leading to a `TypeError`.

### Fix
To fix the bug, we need to handle the case where `self.columns` is `None` before trying to access its length.

### Corrected Version
```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    
    colnames = ''
    
    if self.columns is not None:  # Add a check for NoneType
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

With this correction, the function will first check if `self.columns` is not `None` before trying to access its length, avoiding the `TypeError` when it is `None`.
