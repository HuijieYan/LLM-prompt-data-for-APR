### Bug Explanation:
The bug in the `copy` function is caused by not handling the case where `self.columns` is `None`. When `self.columns` is `None`, the code tries to call `len(None)`, resulting in a `TypeError` because `NoneType` does not have a `len()` method.

### Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to check if `self.columns` is `None` before trying to get its length. If `self.columns` is `None`, we should set `colnames` to an empty string without trying to join the column names.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns is not None:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

By adding the check `if self.columns is not None:` before trying to process the columns, we ensure that the function will handle the case where `self.columns` is `None`. This fix will prevent the `TypeError` and make the function work correctly with the provided test case.
