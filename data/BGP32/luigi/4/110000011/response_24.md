## Analysis:
The buggy function `copy` within the `S3CopyToTable` class in the `luigi/contrib/redshift.py` file is causing issues when `self.columns` is None. This results in a `TypeError` when trying to access the length of `self.columns`.

## Potential Error Locations:
1. The check for the length of `self.columns`.
2. Handling of `self.columns` when it is `None`.

## Cause of the Bug:
The bug occurs because the code does not handle the case where `self.columns` is `None`. The code assumes that `self.columns` will always have a valid list of column names which leads to a `TypeError` when `self.columns` is `None`.

## Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to update the logic to properly handle the case where `self.columns` is `None`. We should first check if `self.columns` is not None before trying to access its length to avoid the `TypeError`.

## Corrected Version:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
``` 

This corrected version of the `copy` function now includes a check to ensure that `self.columns` is not `None` before trying to access its length. This modification addresses the issue reported in the GitHub bug by handling the case where `self.columns` is not provided.
