## Analysis:
- The buggy function `copy` in the `S3CopyToTable` class is responsible for copying data from S3 to Redshift.
- The issue mentioned on GitHub indicates that when `self.columns` is `None`, the function fails with a `TypeError`.
- The buggy function is checking the length of `self.columns` without verifying if it is `None`, leading to the mentioned issue.

## Bug Cause:
- The bug is caused by the assumption that `self.columns` is always a list, leading to a `TypeError` when it is `None`.
- The `len(self.columns)` operation is not guarded against the case when `self.columns` is `None`, which causes the error.

## Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
- To fix the bug, we need to add a check to ensure that `self.columns` is not `None` before trying to calculate its length.
- By checking if `self.columns` exists and has elements before calculating its length, we can prevent the `TypeError` encountered in the buggy function.

## Corrected Version:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

In the corrected version, I added a check `if self.columns` to ensure that `self.columns` is not `None` before trying to calculate its length. This modification prevents the `TypeError` when `self.columns` is `None`.
