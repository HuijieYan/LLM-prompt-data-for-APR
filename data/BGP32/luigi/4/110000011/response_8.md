### Analysis:
The buggy function `copy` in the `S3CopyToTable` class is designed to copy data from S3 into Redshift. The issue reported on GitHub mentions that if the `columns` attribute is set to `None` in the configuration, it causes a `TypeError` because the length of `None` cannot be determined.

### Identified Error Location:
The error likely occurs at this line:
```python
if len(self.columns) > 0:
```
When `self.columns` is `None`, it causes the `TypeError` mentioned in the GitHub issue.

### Cause of the Bug:
The bug arises from the assumption that `self.columns` will always be a non-empty list. When it is set to `None`, the code breaks because `len(None)` is not valid.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to first check if `self.columns` is not `None` before trying to get its length. We will modify the condition to avoid the `TypeError` when `self.columns` is `None`.

### Corrected Version:
Here is the corrected version of the `copy` function:

```python
    def copy(self, cursor, f):
        """
        Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

        If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
        """
        logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
        colnames = ''
        if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:
            colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
            colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

        cursor.execute("""
         COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
         CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
         {options}
         ;""".format(
            table=self.table,
            colnames=colnames,
            source=f,
            creds=self._credentials(),
            options=self.copy_options)
        )
```

By adding the check `if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:`, we ensure that the code only proceeds to determine the column names if `self.columns` is not `None`. This change addresses the root cause of the issue reported on GitHub.
