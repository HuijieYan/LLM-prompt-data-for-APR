## Analysis:
1. The `copy` function in the `S3CopyToTable` class from the `luigi/contrib/redshift.py` file is causing an issue when `self.columns` is not provided, leading to a `TypeError`.
2. The bug occurs when checking the length of `self.columns` without first ensuring that it is not `None`.
3. The bug cause is related to the changes made in a specific pull request mentioned in the GitHub issue. The code is assuming that `self.columns` will always have a value and tries to access its length directly, leading to the `NoneType` error if it is `None`.
4. To fix the bug, we need to first check if `self.columns` is not `None` before trying to access its length.
5. We will modify the `if len(self.columns) > 0` condition to `if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0` to ensure that the length check is only performed if `self.columns` is not `None`.

## Corrected Version:
```python
# The declaration of the class containing the corrected function
class S3CopyToTable(rdbms.CopyToTable, _CredentialsMixin):
    """
    Template task for inserting a data set into Redshift from s3.
    
    Usage:
    
    * Subclass and override the required attributes:
    
      * `host`,
      * `database`,
      * `user`,
      * `password`,
      * `table`,
      * `columns`,
      * `s3_load_path`.
    
    * You can also override the attributes provided by the
      CredentialsMixin if they are not supplied by your
      configuration or environment variables.
    """

    def copy(self, cursor, f):
        """
        Defines copying from s3 into redshift.
    
        If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
        """
        logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
        colnames = ''
        if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:  # Fix for the bug
            colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
            colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)
    
        cursor.execute("""
         COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
         CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
         {options}
         ;""".format(
            table=self.table,
            colnames=colnames,
            source=f,
            creds=self._credentials(),
            options=self.copy_options)
        )
```

By making this change, the bug related to the length check of `self.columns` will be fixed, and the `TypeError` issue will be resolved when `self.columns` is not provided.
