## Analysis:
1. The buggy function `copy` within the `S3CopyToTable` class in the file `luigi/contrib/redshift.py` is responsible for copying data from S3 to Redshift.
2. The issue reported on GitHub mentions that when `columns` attribute is not provided (set to `None`), it leads to a `TypeError` due to attempting to check the length of `None`.
3. The bug occurs because the code does not validate if `self.columns` is `None` before trying to access its length. This results in an error when `self.columns` is `None`.
4. To fix the bug, we need to explicitly check if `self.columns` is not `None` before trying to access its length.
5. The corrected version of the function should include this check to prevent the `TypeError`.

## Corrected Version:
```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns is not None and len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

By adding the check `if self.columns is not None and len(self.columns) > 0:`, we ensure that the code only attempts to access the length of `self.columns` if it is not `None`, thus resolving the `TypeError` issue when `columns` are not provided.
