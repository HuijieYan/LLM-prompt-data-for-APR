The bug in the `copy` function is caused by the use of `len(self.columns)` without checking if `self.columns` is `None`, which leads to the `TypeError: object of type 'NoneType' has no len()` error when `self.columns` is not provided.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the line where `len(self.columns)` is used to ensure `self.columns` is not `None` before checking its length. We can update the code to check if `self.columns` exists and has a length greater than 0 before proceeding with further operations.

Here is the corrected version of the `copy` function:
```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:  # Check if self.columns is not None and has a length greater than 0
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

By making this change, the function will now safely handle cases where `self.columns` is not provided, preventing the `TypeError` mentioned in the GitHub issue.
