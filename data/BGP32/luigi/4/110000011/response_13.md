## Analyzing the buggy function and its relationship with the GitHub issue

The buggy function `copy` in the `S3CopyToTable` class from `luigi/contrib/redshift.py` is causing an issue when the `columns` attribute is not provided. The issue reported on GitHub mentions that running Redshift COPY jobs with `columns = None` to prohibit table creation fails due to a `TypeError` related to trying to get the length of `NoneType`. The proposed solution suggests changing the condition to check for `self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0`.

## Identifying potential error locations within the buggy function

The potential error in the buggy function lies in the condition `if len(self.columns) > 0:` because if `self.columns` is None, it will raise a `TypeError` when trying to get the length of `NoneType`.

## Explaining the cause of the bug using the buggy function, the buggy class docs, the GitHub Issue information

The bug occurs because the buggy function assumes that `self.columns` will always have a value and tries to get its length without checking if it is `None`. This behavior results in a `TypeError` when `self.columns` is not provided, as reported in the GitHub issue.

## Suggesting a strategy for fixing the bug

To fix the bug, we should modify the condition to first check if `self.columns` is not `None` before trying to get its length. By updating the condition to `if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:`, we ensure that the length check is only performed when `self.columns` is not `None`.

## The corrected version of the buggy function

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

In the corrected version, the condition `if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:` is used to check if `self.columns` is not `None` before attempting to get its length. This modification addresses the bug reported in the GitHub issue related to Redshift COPY failures when columns are not provided.
