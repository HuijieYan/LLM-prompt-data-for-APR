## Analysis:
The buggy function `copy` in the `S3CopyToTable` class is causing an issue where if `self.columns` is not provided, it results in a `TypeError` due to trying to get the length of `None`.

## Potential Error Locations:
The error is likely occurring in the line `if len(self.columns) > 0:` where `self.columns` is assumed to always have a value.

## Cause of the Bug:
The bug stems from assuming that `self.columns` will always have a value when trying to get its length. When `self.columns` is not provided (set to `None`), the function tries to call `len(None)`, resulting in a `TypeError`.

## Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix this bug, we need to check if `self.columns` is not None before trying to get its length. This will prevent the `TypeError` that occurs when `self.columns` is not provided.

## Corrected Version:
```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:  # Check if self.columns is not None
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

By adding the check `if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:` before trying to get the length of `self.columns`, we ensure that the function will only proceed further if `self.columns` is not `None`. This correction addresses the issue reported in the GitHub bug related to Redshift COPY failures when `columns` are not provided.
