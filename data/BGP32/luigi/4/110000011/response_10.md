## Explanation:

The bug occurs in the `copy` function of the `S3CopyToTable` class within the `luigi.contrib.redshift` module. The issue arises when the `self.columns` attribute is not provided (set to `None`), causing an error when attempting to get the length of `self.columns`.

The root cause of the bug is in the conditional check `if len(self.columns) > 0:`, which does not account for the scenario where `self.columns` is `None`. This triggers the error `TypeError: object of type 'NoneType' has no len()`.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the conditional check to handle the case when `self.columns` is `None` before trying to get its length.

## Fixing the Bug:

Here is the corrected version of the `copy` function that addresses the bug:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

This modification ensures that the code checks if `self.columns` is not `None` before attempting to get its length. If `self.columns` is `None`, it will skip trying to construct `colnames` based on it, thus preventing the `TypeError`.
