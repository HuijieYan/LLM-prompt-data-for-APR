## Analysis:
The buggy function `copy` in the `S3CopyToTable` class is failing when the `self.columns` attribute is not provided. The error occurs because the code directly tries to get the length of `self.columns` without considering the case when `self.columns` is `None`, leading to a `TypeError`.

## Error Locations:
- The `if len(self.columns) > 0:` line is problematic as it assumes `self.columns` is always a list.

## Cause of the Bug:
The bug occurs due to the assumption that `self.columns` will always have a value, leading to an error when it is `None`. This behavior was introduced in a recent change (as referenced in the GitHub issue) which now requires handling the case when `self.columns` are not provided explicitly.

## Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to check if `self.columns` is not `None` before trying to get its length. This check will prevent the `TypeError` that occurs when `self.columns` is `None`.

## Corrected Version:
```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

By adding the `if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:` condition, we ensure that the code only attempts to get the length of `self.columns` if it has a valid value, preventing the `TypeError` when `self.columns` is `None`.
