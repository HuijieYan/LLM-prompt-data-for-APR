### Analysis:
The buggy function `copy` in the `S3CopyToTable` class of the `luigi/contrib/redshift.py` file is causing an issue when the `self.columns` attribute is set to `None`. This issue is related to the GitHub problem where Redshift COPY jobs fail in Luigi 2.7.1 when columns are not provided.

### Identified Error:
The buggy function is assuming that `self.columns` will always have a value, which is causing an error when it is `None`.

### Cause of the Bug:
The bug is caused by the assumption that `self.columns` will always have a value without checking for it. When `self.columns` is `None`, the function tries to access its length, resulting in the `TypeError: object of type 'NoneType' has no len()` error.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to update the code to check if `self.columns` is not `None` before attempting to access its length. This will prevent the `TypeError` when `self.columns` is not provided.

### Corrected Version:
```python
# The buggy function is fixed here
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.
    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

By adding the check `if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:`, we ensure that the code will only try to access the length of `self.columns` if it is not `None`. This correction addresses the issue described in the GitHub problem.
