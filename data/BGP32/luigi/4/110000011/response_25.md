### Analysis:
The buggy function `copy` in the `S3CopyToTable` class from `luigi/contrib/redshift.py` is causing an issue when `self.columns` is not provided, leading to a `TypeError` due to trying to get the length of a `NoneType` object.

### Error Location:
The issue arises in this line of code:
```python
if len(self.columns) > 0:
```
Here, if `self.columns` is not provided (or is `None`), it will result in a `TypeError`.

### Cause of the Bug:
The bug is caused by assuming that `self.columns` will always be provided and won't be `None`. This assumption leads to an error when trying to access the length of `self.columns` without validating if it's `None` or not.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we should check if `self.columns` is not `None` before trying to access its length. This will prevent the `TypeError` when `self.columns` is not provided.

### Corrected Version:
Here is the corrected version of the `copy` function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

This corrected version checks if `self.columns` is not `None` before trying to access its length, resolving the `TypeError` issue mentioned in the GitHub bug report.
