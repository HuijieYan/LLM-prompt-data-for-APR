## Analysis:
The buggy function `copy` within the `S3CopyToTable` class in `luigi/contrib/redshift.py` is causing an issue when the `self.columns` attribute is `None`, resulting in a `TypeError` due to trying to get the length of a `NoneType`.

## Identified potential error locations:
1. The `if len(self.columns) > 0` condition without checking if `self.columns` is `None`.
2. Not handling the case when `self.columns` is `None` properly.

## Cause of the bug:
The bug is caused by not handling the scenario where `self.columns` is `None`. The condition `if len(self.columns) > 0:` directly tries to get the length of `self.columns`, assuming it's a list. When `self.columns` is `None`, it leads to a `TypeError` since `None` does not have a length.

## Fixing the bug:
To fix the bug, we should first check if `self.columns` is not `None` before trying to get its length. This will prevent the `TypeError` when `self.columns` is `None`. We will also update the condition to be more explicit and handle the case when `self.columns` is an empty list as well.

## Corrected Version:

```python
    def copy(self, cursor, f):
        """
        Defines copying from s3 into redshift.
    
        If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
        """
        logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
        colnames = ''
        if self.columns:  # Check if self.columns is not None
            if len(self.columns) > 0:  # Check if self.columns is not empty
                colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
                colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)
    
        cursor.execute("""
         COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
         CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
         {options}
         ;""".format(
            table=self.table,
            colnames=colnames,
            source=f,
            creds=self._credentials(),
            options=self.copy_options)
        )
```

By making these adjustments in the `copy` function, we ensure that the code first checks if `self.columns` exists before operating on it, preventing the `TypeError` when it's `None`.
