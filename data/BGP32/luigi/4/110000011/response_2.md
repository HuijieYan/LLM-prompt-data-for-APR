## Analysis:
The buggy function `copy` in the class `S3CopyToTable` from `luigi/contrib/redshift.py` is causing an issue when the `columns` attribute is not provided. The bug is leading to a `TypeError: object of type 'NoneType' has no len()` error message when trying to access the length of `self.columns`.

## Potential Error Locations:
1. Accessing the length of `self.columns` without checking if it's `None`.
2. The condition `if len(self.columns) > 0:` may cause an error if `self.columns` is `None`.

## Bug Cause:
The bug is triggered by the assumption that `self.columns` will always have a value. When `columns` is not provided in the subclass, `self.columns` defaults to `None`, leading to the `TypeError` when trying to get its length.

## Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to update the condition that checks the length of `self.columns` to handle the case when `self.columns` is `None`. By adding an extra conditional check to ensure there are columns available before trying to access their length, we can prevent the `TypeError` from occurring.

## Corrected Version:
```python
    def copy(self, cursor, f):
        """
        Defines copying from s3 into redshift.
    
        If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
        """
        logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
        colnames = ''
        if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:
            colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
            colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)
    
        cursor.execute("""
         COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
         CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
         {options}
         ;""".format(
            table=self.table,
            colnames=colnames,
            source=f,
            creds=self._credentials(),
            options=self.copy_options)
        )
```

In the corrected version of the `copy` function, we added the conditional check `if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:` to ensure that we only try to access the length of `self.columns` when it is not `None`. This change will prevent the `TypeError` when `columns` is not provided in the subclass, as suggested in the GitHub issue.
