## Analyzing the buggy function and its relationship with the GitHub issue

The buggy function `copy` in the `S3CopyToTable` class of the `luigi/contrib/redshift.py` file is causing an issue when the `columns` attribute is not provided. This issue is discussed in the GitHub post titled "Redshift COPY fails in luigi 2.7.1 when columns are not provided". The bug is described as a `TypeError` due to trying to get the length of `NoneType` when `columns` is not provided.

## Potential error locations within the buggy function

The potential error location in the buggy function is the following line:
```python
if len(self.columns) > 0:
```
If `self.columns` is `None`, trying to get the length of `None` will result in a `TypeError`.

## Cause of the bug using the buggy function and the GitHub Issue information

The bug occurs because when `self.columns` is not provided in the task, it defaults to `None`. Then, trying to check the length of `None` throws a `TypeError`. The suggested fix in the GitHub issue recommends checking if `self.columns` exists (not `None`) before trying to get its length.

## Strategy for fixing the bug

To fix the bug, we need to modify the line where the length of `self.columns` is checked. We will first check if `self.columns` exists and then proceed to check its length, or we can directly iterate over the columns without checking if it's `None`.

## The corrected version of the buggy function

Here is the corrected version of the `copy` function that addresses the bug mentioned in the GitHub issue:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

In this corrected version, we check if `self.columns` exists before trying to get its length. This change ensures that the code does not throw a `TypeError` when `self.columns` is `None`.
