## Analysis:
1. The buggy function is `copy` inside the `S3CopyToTable` class in the `luigi/contrib/redshift.py` file.
2. The bug is related to how the function handles the `self.columns` attribute when it is not provided.
3. The bug causes a `TypeError: object of type 'NoneType' has no len()` when `self.columns` is not provided. This is due to the code assuming `self.columns` will always have a value without checking explicitly.
4. The suggested fix from the GitHub issue is to check if `self.columns` is not None before checking its length.

## Correction:
```python
    def copy(self, cursor, f):
        """
        Defines copying from s3 into redshift.
    
        If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
        """
        logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
        colnames = ''
        if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:
            colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
            colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)
    
        cursor.execute("""
         COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
         CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
         {options}
         ;""".format(
            table=self.table,
            colnames=colnames,
            source=f,
            creds=self._credentials(),
            options=self.copy_options)
        )
```

By adding the `if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0` condition before manipulating `colnames`, we ensure that the code does not break when `self.columns` is not provided. This correction aligns with the suggestion provided in the GitHub issue.
