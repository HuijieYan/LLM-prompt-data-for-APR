## Analyzing the Buggy Function:

The buggy function `copy` in the `S3CopyToTable` class in the `luigi.contrib.redshift` module is responsible for copying data from S3 to Redshift. The bug occurs when the `columns` attribute is not provided, resulting in a TypeError due to trying to get the length of a NoneType.

## Potential Error Locations:
1. The condition `if len(self.columns) > 0` directly attempts to get the length of `self.columns`.
2. When `self.columns` is not provided, it defaults to None, leading to the TypeError.

## Bug Cause:
The bug is caused because the code does not handle the scenario where the `columns` attribute might not be provided. When `self.columns` is None, trying to get its length (`len(self.columns)`) results in a TypeError.

## Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to add a check to ensure that `self.columns` is not None before trying to get its length. This check will prevent the TypeError when `columns` attribute is not provided.

## Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from S3 into Redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:  # Check if self.columns is not None
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

## Corrected Function Explanation:
In the corrected version, we added a check `if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0` to ensure that `self.columns` is not None before trying to get its length. This modification will prevent the TypeError when `columns` attribute is not provided, fixing the bug reported on GitHub.
