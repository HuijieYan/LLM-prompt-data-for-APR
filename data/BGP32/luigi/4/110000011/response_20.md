## Analysis:
1. The `copy` function within the `S3CopyToTable` class in `luigi/contrib/redshift.py` is responsible for copying data from an S3 source into Redshift.
2. The issue reported on GitHub indicates that when `columns` are not provided (set to `None`), the function fails with a `TypeError` due to attempting to get the length of a `NoneType`.
3. The buggy function checks the length of `self.columns` without first checking if `self.columns` is not None, leading to the `TypeError` when `columns` is None.
4. To fix this bug, we need to explicitly check if `self.columns` is not None before trying to get its length.

## Bug Fix:
```python
# Corrected version of the buggy function
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns is not None and len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

By explicitly checking if `self.columns` is not None before trying to determine its length, we avoid the `TypeError` that occurs when `columns` is None. This fix addresses the issue reported on GitHub and ensures that the `copy` function works correctly even when `columns` are not provided.
