## Analysis:
1. The buggy function `copy` in the `S3CopyToTable` class is responsible for copying data from S3 to Redshift.
2. The bug occurs when `self.columns` is not provided, causing an error because the length of `None` is being checked.
3. The root cause is identified in the GitHub issue where it is mentioned that providing `columns=None` to prohibit table creation fails due to the check for the length of `self.columns`. The fix suggested is to change the check to `if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0`.
4. To fix the bug, we need to modify the check for the length of `self.columns` to handle cases where `self.columns` is `None`.
5. The correction will involve updating the condition for checking the existence and length of `self.columns` to avoid the error.

## Corrected Version:
```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: luigi/contrib/redshift.py

# The declaration of the class containing the corrected function
class S3CopyToTable(rdbms.CopyToTable, _CredentialsMixin):
    """
    Template task for inserting a data set into Redshift from s3.
    
    Usage:
    
    * Subclass and override the required attributes:
    
      * `host`,
      * `database`,
      * `user`,
      * `password`,
      * `table`,
      * `columns`,
      * `s3_load_path`.
    
    * You can also override the attributes provided by the
      CredentialsMixin if they are not supplied by your
      configuration or environment variables.
    """

    def copy(self, cursor, f):
        """
        Defines copying from s3 into redshift.
    
        If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
        """
        logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
        colnames = ''
        if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:  # Fix to check if self.columns is not None
            colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
            colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)
    
        cursor.execute("""
         COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
         CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
         {options}
         ;""".format(
            table=self.table,
            colnames=colnames,
            source=f,
            creds=self._credentials(),
            options=self.copy_options)
        )
```

By updating the condition to check if `self.columns` is not `None` before checking its length in the `copy` function, we can avoid the `TypeError` that occurs when `columns=None` is provided.
