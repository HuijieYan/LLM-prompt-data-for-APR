## Analysis:
1. The `copy` function in the `S3CopyToTable` class is responsible for copying data from S3 to Redshift.
2. The bug is caused by assuming `self.columns` always has a value and trying to get its length without checking if it's `None`.
3. The GitHub issue points out that when `columns = None` is provided, an error occurs due to checking the length of `None`. The suggested fix is to add `if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:` to handle cases where `columns` is `None`.
4. A strategy to fix this bug would be to check if `self.columns` is not `None` before trying to get its length.

## Corrected Version:
```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns is not None and len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```
