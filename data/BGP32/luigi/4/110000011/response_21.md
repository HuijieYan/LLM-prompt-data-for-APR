## Analysis:
The buggy function `copy` in the `S3CopyToTable` class is causing an issue when `self.columns` is `None`, resulting in a `TypeError` due to trying to get the length of `None`.

## Potential Error Locations:
The error is likely occurring at the line `if len(self.columns) > 0:` where `self.columns` is assumed to be a list but is `None` in some cases.

## Cause of the Bug:
The bug is caused because the function does not handle the scenario where `self.columns` is `None` properly. When `self.columns` is `None`, trying to get the length of `None` will result in a `TypeError`.

## Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to check if `self.columns` is not `None` before trying to get its length. By adding an additional check, we can avoid the `TypeError` when `self.columns` is `None`.

## Corrected Version:
Below is the corrected version of the `copy` function in the `S3CopyToTable` class:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

By adding the check `if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:` we ensure that we only try to get the length of `self.columns` when it is not `None`, thus avoiding the `TypeError` mentioned in the GitHub issue.
