### Analysis:
The buggy function `copy` within the class `S3CopyToTable` in the `luigi/contrib/redshift.py` file is responsible for copying data from S3 into Redshift. The reported issue on GitHub indicates that when the `columns` attribute is set to `None`, it causes a `TypeError` due to the attempt to get the length of a `NoneType` object.

### Potential Error Locations:
The error is likely to occur at the line where the length of `self.columns` is being checked.

### Cause of the Bug:
The bug occurs because the code directly tries to get the length of `self.columns` without checking if `self.columns` is `None` or not. In the case where `columns` is `None`, calling `len(self.columns)` results in a `TypeError`.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to add a check to see if `self.columns` is not `None` before trying to get its length. This will prevent the `TypeError` by only attempting to get the length when `self.columns` is a valid list.

### Corrected Version:
Here is the corrected version of the `copy` function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from S3 into Redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:  # Check if self.columns is not None
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

By making this simple change in the if condition to check if `self.columns` is not `None`, we prevent the `TypeError` when `columns` is `None` and ensure that the COPY operation works correctly even when columns are not provided.
