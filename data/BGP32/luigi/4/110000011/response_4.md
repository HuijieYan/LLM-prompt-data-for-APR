There is a bug in the `copy` function of the `S3CopyToTable` class in the `redshift.py` file under the `luigi/contrib` directory. The bug causes an error when trying to perform a Redshift COPY operation without providing any column information, leading to a `TypeError` due to attempting to get the length of `None`.

The bug occurs in the following block of code within the `copy` function:
```python
colnames = ''
if len(self.columns) > 0:
    colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
    colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)
```

The bug is due to assuming that `self.columns` is always defined and trying to get its length without checking for `None` values. The suggested solution from the GitHub issue is to modify this block as follows:
```python
if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:
    colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
    colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)
```

This change ensures that `self.columns` is not `None` before attempting to access its length.

Here is the corrected version of the `copy` function:
```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

This corrected version includes the necessary check to avoid the `TypeError` when `self.columns` is not provided.
