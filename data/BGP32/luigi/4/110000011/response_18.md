## Analysis:
The buggy function `copy` in the `S3CopyToTable` class from the `luigi/contrib/redshift.py` file is attempting to handle column names for a Redshift COPY operation. However, it encounters an error when the `columns` attribute is not provided, resulting in a `TypeError`.

## Error Locations:
1. In the line `if len(self.columns) > 0:` the code is trying to check the length of the `columns` attribute without verifying if it has a valid value, causing the `TypeError` when `columns` is `None`.

## Cause of the Bug:
The bug arises from the assumption that `self.columns` will always contain a valid list of column names. When `columns` is set to `None` to prohibit table creation, the function attempts to get the length of `None`, resulting in a `TypeError`.

## Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To resolve the bug, we need to check if `self.columns` is not `None` before trying to determine its length. This change will prevent the `TypeError` when `columns` is not provided.

## Corrected Version:
```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

By making the modification in the corrected version above, we check if `self.columns` has a valid value before accessing its length, preventing the `TypeError` when `columns` is `None`. This change aligns with the suggested solution in the GitHub issue to handle the case where `columns` is intentionally set to `None`.
