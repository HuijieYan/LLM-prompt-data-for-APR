## Analysis:
The buggy function `copy()` in the `S3CopyToTable` class from `luigi/contrib/redshift.py` is causing an issue when the `columns` attribute is not provided. The error arises from trying to get the length of `self.columns` without checking if it is `None` first. This results in a `TypeError: object of type 'NoneType' has no len()` when `self.columns` is `None`.

## Fixes:
We need to modify the code in the `copy()` function to fix this issue. The fix involves checking if `self.columns` is not `None` before trying to get its length.

Here is the corrected version of the `copy()` function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

By adding the condition `if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:` before attempting to get the length of `self.columns`, we prevent the `TypeError` when `self.columns` is `None`. This change aligns with the suggested solution in the GitHub issue, fixing the bug.
