The bug in the provided function is caused by the comparison `if len(self.columns) > 0` where `self.columns` is potentially `None`, resulting in a `TypeError` when trying to get the length of a `NoneType`.

To fix this bug, we need to handle the case where `self.columns` is `None` before attempting to get its length. We can use a conditional check to ensure that `self.columns` is not `None` before proceeding with the comparison.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns is not None and len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

With this correction, the function will first check if `self.columns` is not `None` before attempting to determine its length. This will prevent the `TypeError` that was occurring before.

This corrected version should now pass the failing test case provided and handle the case when `self.columns` is `None`.
