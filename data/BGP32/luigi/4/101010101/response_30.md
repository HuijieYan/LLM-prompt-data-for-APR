### Analysis
1. The error occurs due to the comparison `if len(self.columns) > 0:` where `self.columns` is `None`.
2. The buggy function is trying to check the length of `self.columns`, but it fails because `self.columns` is `None`.
3. The error message indicates a `TypeError` due to trying to get the length of a `NoneType` object.
4. To fix the bug, we need to check if `self.columns` is not `None` before getting its length.
5. Modify the buggy function to include a check for `None` before checking the length.

### Corrected Version
```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns is not None and len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
``` 

By adding the check `if self.columns is not None` before checking its length, we prevent the `TypeError` from occurring when `self.columns` is `None`. This corrected version should pass the failing test case and handle the `None` case appropriately.
