### Identified Bug:
The bug in the provided code is in the `copy` function where the `if len(self.columns) > 0:` line is trying to access the `len()` function on a `None` type object (`self.columns` is `None` in the given test case). This results in a `TypeError` because `len()` cannot be called on a `NoneType` object.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix this bug, we need to check if `self.columns` is `None` before trying to access its length. We can modify the `if` condition to check for both `None` and non-empty list type before proceeding.

### Corrected Code:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:  # Check if self.columns is not None and has elements
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options())
    )
```

By adding the check `if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:` we ensure that we only attempt to access the length of `self.columns` if it is not `None`. This will prevent the `TypeError` encountered in the failing test case.
