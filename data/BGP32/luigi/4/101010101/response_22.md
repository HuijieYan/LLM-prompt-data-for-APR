The bug in the provided function is due to trying to get the length of a `None` type object in the line `if len(self.columns) > 0:` when `self.columns` is set to `None`. The error message clearly states that `object of type 'NoneType' has no len()`.

To fix this bug, we need to add a check to handle the case when `self.columns` is `None` before trying to get its length.

Here is a corrected version of the function:

```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: luigi/contrib/redshift.py

# The declaration of the class containing the corrected function
class S3CopyToTable(rdbms.CopyToTable, _CredentialsMixin):
    # This function from the same class is called by the buggy function
    def copy_options(self):
        # Please ignore the body of this function

    # Bug-fixed version of the copy function
    def copy(self, cursor, f):
        """
        Defines copying from s3 into redshift.
    
        If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
        """
        logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
        colnames = ''
        if self.columns is not None:
            colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
            colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)
    
        cursor.execute("""
         COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
         CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
         {options}
         ;""".format(
            table=self.table,
            colnames=colnames,
            source=f,
            creds=self._credentials(),
            options=self.copy_options)
        )
```

This corrected version checks if `self.columns` is not `None` before trying to get its length, avoiding the `TypeError` that occurred previously. Now, when `self.columns` is `None`, it will skip the concatenation into `colnames` and proceed with the rest of the script without any errors.
