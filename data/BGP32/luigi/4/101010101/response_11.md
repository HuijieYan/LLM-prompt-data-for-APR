### Analysis
The error occurs because the `self.columns` attribute in `DummyS3CopyToTableKey` is `None`, causing the `TypeError` when trying to check its length. The buggy function does not handle the case where `self.columns` is `None` properly.

### Bug Cause
The bug is caused by not handling the case where `self.columns` is `None` in the buggy function `copy`.

### Fix Strategy
We need to check if `self.columns` is `None` before trying to access its length in the buggy function. If it is `None`, we can set `colnames` to an empty string directly.

### Corrected Version

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns is not None:  # Check if columns is not None
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
``` 

By adding the check `if self.columns is not None`, we ensure that the buggy function will handle cases where `self.columns` is `None` without causing a `TypeError`.
