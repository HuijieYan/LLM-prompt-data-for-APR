The bug in the provided function is caused by trying to determine the length of a NoneType object (`self.columns`) in the buggy function `copy`. This results in a `TypeError` when trying to check the length of `self.columns`.

To fix this bug, we need to add a check to ensure that `self.columns` is not None before attempting to get its length.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:  # Add a check for NoneType before getting length
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

By adding the check `if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0`, we ensure that the length of `self.columns` is only checked if it is not None. This prevents the `TypeError` from occurring when the function is called with `columns=None`.

With this correction, the function should now handle cases where `self.columns` is None without raising any errors, passing the failing test case provided.
