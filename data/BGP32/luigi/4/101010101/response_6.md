The bug in the provided code is in the line where it checks the length of `self.columns`, which is of type NoneType when the `columns` parameter is None. This results in a TypeError when trying to apply the `len()` function on a NoneType object.

To fix this bug, we can add a check to handle the case when `self.columns` is None before trying to get its length.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: luigi/contrib/redshift.py

# The declaration of the class containing the corrected function
class S3CopyToTable(rdbms.CopyToTable, _CredentialsMixin):
    # This function from the same class is called by the corrected function
    def copy_options(self):
        # Please ignore the body of this function


    def copy(self, cursor, f):
        """
        Defines copying from s3 into redshift.
    
        If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
        """
        logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
        colnames = ''
        if self.columns is not None:
            if len(self.columns) > 0:
                colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
                colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)
    
        cursor.execute("""
         COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
         CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
         {options}
         ;""".format(
            table=self.table,
            colnames=colnames,
            source=f,
            creds=self._credentials(),
            options=self.copy_options)
        )
```

This corrected version includes a check for `self.columns` before attempting to get its length, which solves the TypeError issue when `self.columns` is None.

The corrected function should now pass the failing test and satisfy the expected input/output values.
