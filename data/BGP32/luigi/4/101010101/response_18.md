### Analysis
The error occurs because the `self.columns` attribute is set to `None`, which leads to a `TypeError` when trying to check its length in the `copy` function. The code does not handle the case where the `columns` attribute is `None` correctly. To fix this bug, we need to add a condition to check if `self.columns` is not `None` before trying to get its length.

### Bug Fix
```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns is not None:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

By adding the condition `if self.columns is not None:`, we ensure that the code only tries to access the length of `self.columns` if it is not `None`. This change will prevent the `TypeError` and fix the bug in the `copy` function.
