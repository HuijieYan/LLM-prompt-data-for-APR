### Analysis
- The error occurs due to trying to get the length of `self.columns` when `self.columns` is `None`.
- The `columns` parameter is passed as `None` in the `DummyS3CopyToTableKey` object which leads to the `TypeError` while trying to check its length.
- The `copy_options` function is not being called to generate the options string.
- The `copy_options` variable is a function that needs to be called to retrieve the options string but is missing the function call `()`.
- In the `cursor.execute` call, the `options=self.copy_options` should be `options=self.copy_options()`.

### Fixing the Bug
To fix the bug:
- Check if `self.columns` is `None` before trying to get its length.
- Call the `copy_options` function to generate the options string.
- Modify the `cursor.execute` call to call `self.copy_options()` to retrieve the options string.

### Corrected Version
```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    
    if self.columns is not None and len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)
    
    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options())
    )
