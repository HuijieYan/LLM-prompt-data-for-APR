### Bug Analysis:
- The buggy function `copy` is expecting `self.columns` to be a list, but in the failing test case, it is `None`.
- The `if len(self.columns) > 0:` line is causing a `TypeError` because we can't get the length of `None`.
- This error is encountered due to improper handling of the `columns` attribute when it is `None`.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
- To fix this bug, we need to check if `self.columns` is `None` before trying to access its length.
- If `self.columns` is `None`, we can assign an empty list to `colnames` to handle this case.

### Corrected Function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns is not None and len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

By adding the check `if self.columns is not None` before accessing the length of `self.columns`, we can prevent the `TypeError` when `self.columns` is `None`. This corrected version of the function should now handle the case where `columns` is `None` correctly.
