### Fixing the bug

- **Issue**: The error occurs because the `self.columns` attribute is None, and the buggy function tries to determine its length, which is not possible for a NoneType object.

- **Strategy for fixing**: Before checking the length of `self.columns`, ensure that it is not None by adding a condition to handle this scenario.

### Corrected Version

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    
    if self.columns is not None:  # Check if columns is not None
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options())
    )
```

In the corrected version, I added the condition `if self.columns is not None` to check if `self.columns` is not None before attempting to calculate its length. This change will prevent the TypeError when `self.columns` is None.
