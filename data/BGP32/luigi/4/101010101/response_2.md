### Buggy Function Analysis
The buggy function `copy` is failing due to a `TypeError: object of type 'NoneType' has no len()` when trying to check the length of `self.columns`. The error message indicates that `self.columns` is of type `None`, which causes the function to fail.

### Bug Location
The bug is located at the following line:
```python
if len(self.columns) > 0:
```
Here, `self.columns` is expected to be a list or another iterable object, but it is being passed as `None`.

### Cause of the Bug
The buggy function `copy` assumes that `self.columns` will always be a list of columns. However, in the failing test case, `columns=None` is passed to the `DummyS3CopyToTableKey` object, making `self.columns` equal to `None`. This leads to the `TypeError` when trying to get the length of `None`.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug
To fix the bug, we need to handle the case where `self.columns` is `None` by checking if it is not `None` before trying to get its length. We can add an additional condition to handle this scenario.

### Corrected Function
```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)
        
    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

In the corrected version, we added the condition `if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:` to first check if `self.columns` is not `None` before attempting to get its length. This modification ensures that the function won't throw a `TypeError` when `self.columns` is `None`.
