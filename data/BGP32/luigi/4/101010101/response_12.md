### Analysis
1. The error message indicates a `TypeError: object of type 'NoneType' has no len()`. This error occurs at line 356 in the `copy` function when trying to check the length of `self.columns`.
2. The buggy function fails to handle the case where `self.columns` is `None` properly.
3. `self.columns` is expected to be a list of column names. If it is `None`, the buggy function does not account for this and tries to perform operations on a `NoneType`.
4. To fix the bug, we need to check if `self.columns` is `None` before trying to get its length or construct `colnames`.

### Correction
```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

This correction adds a check for `self.columns` being `None` before trying to access its length. If `self.columns` is `None`, it will skip constructing `colnames` and the subsequent operations that rely on it.
