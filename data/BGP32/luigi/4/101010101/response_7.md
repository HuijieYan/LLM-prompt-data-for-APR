### Analysis
The error message indicates a `TypeError` due to trying to get the length of `self.columns`, which is `None`. This occurs because the `columns` parameter is not properly handled in the `copy` function, leading to the comparison causing the error. The `copy_options` function is not being called to populate the `options` variable in the query string.

### Solution
To fix the bug, we need to handle the case where `self.columns` is `None` and also properly call the `copy_options` function to populate the `options` variable in the query string.

### Corrected Version
```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.
    
    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)
    
    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options())
    )
```

By checking if `self.columns` is not `None` before checking its length and properly calling `self.copy_options()` to get the options string, we ensure that the function executes correctly without errors.
