### Analysis
1. The buggy function `copy` is trying to check the length of `self.columns`, which can be `None`. This results in a `TypeError: object of type 'NoneType' has no len()` when trying to determine the length.
2. The expected input values are captured as parameters `f` and `self` (with `self.columns` being `None`). The expected output variable value is `colnames` being an empty string (`''`).

### Bug Cause
The buggy function does not handle the case where `self.columns` is `None`, leading to a `TypeError` when trying to get its length.

### Fix Strategy
We need to add a check to handle the case where `self.columns` is `None` before trying to determine its length. We can set `colnames` to an empty string if `self.columns` is `None`. 

### Corrected Version
```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.
    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:  # Check if self.columns exists and is not None
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

This corrected version includes a check for `self.columns` before trying to determine its length, ensuring that the code does not raise a `TypeError`.
