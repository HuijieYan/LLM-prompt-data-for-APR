### Identified Bug:
The buggy function `copy` is raising a `TypeError: object of type 'NoneType' has no len()` because `self.columns` is `None`, and it is trying to apply the `len` function on a NoneType object.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
We need to handle the case where `self.columns` is `None` before trying to get the length of it. One possible solution is to check if `self.columns` is `None` and assign an empty list `[]` to `colnames` in that case.

### Corrected Function:
```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns is not None:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
``` 

After incorporating this fix, the corrected function should handle the case when `self.columns` is `None` and prevent the `TypeError` from occurring.
