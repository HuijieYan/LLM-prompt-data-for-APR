### Explanation
The error occurs because the `self.columns` attribute is `None`, causing a `TypeError` when trying to check its length in the line `if len(self.columns) > 0`. The expected behavior is to handle the case where `self.columns` is `None` and avoid trying to access its length.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug
To fix the bug, we need to include a check for `None` before trying to access the length of `self.columns`. If `self.columns` is `None`, we can set `colnames` to an empty string to avoid the `TypeError`.

### Corrected Version of the Function
```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns is not None:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options())
    )
``` 

In the corrected version above, we check if `self.columns` is not `None` before trying to access its length. If `self.columns` is `None`, we set `colnames` to an empty string. This change ensures that the function runs without errors and handles the case where `self.columns` is `None`.
