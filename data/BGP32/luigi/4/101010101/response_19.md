The bug in the provided function is caused by trying to call `len()` on a `NoneType` object (self.columns) in the line `if len(self.columns) > 0:`. This results in a `TypeError`.

To fix this bug, we need to check if `self.columns` is `None` before trying to get its length. If `self.columns` is `None`, we should handle it appropriately to avoid the `TypeError`.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    
    if self.columns is not None and len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options())
    )
```

By adding the check `if self.columns is not None and len(self.columns) > 0:`, we ensure that we only try to get the length of `self.columns` when it is not `None`. This modification should fix the bug and handle the `NoneType` object correctly.

This corrected version should now pass the failing test and satisfy the expected input/output values.
