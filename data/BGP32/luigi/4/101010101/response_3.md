### Analysis
1. The error message indicates a `TypeError: object of type 'NoneType' has no len()`. This error occurs when trying to access the `len()` function on a variable that is `None`.
2. In the buggy function, the error is likely happening because the `self.columns` attribute is set to `None`, causing the `if len(self.columns) > 0:` condition to fail.
3. The `self.columns` attribute is set to `None` in the `DummyS3CopyToTableKey` class, causing the bug in the `copy` function.
4. To fix this bug, we need to handle the case where `self.columns` is `None` before trying to access its length.

### Solution
I will modify the `copy` function to check if `self.columns` is not `None` before trying to access its length. If `self.columns` is `None`, I will set `colnames` to an empty string to avoid the `TypeError` that was occurring.

### Corrected Version

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:  # Check if self.columns is not None before accessing its length
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options())
    )
```

By adding `if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:` we ensure that we only try to access the length of `self.columns` if it is not `None`. This modification will prevent the `TypeError` from occurring and the function should now handle the scenario where `self.columns` is `None`.
