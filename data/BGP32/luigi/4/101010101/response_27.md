The bug in the provided function is caused by the comparison `if len(self.columns) > 0` where `self.columns` is `None`. This comparison causes a `TypeError` when trying to find the length of a `NoneType` object.

To fix this bug, we need to check if `self.columns` is not `None` before checking its length. We can do this by adding `if self.columns is not None:` before the `if len(self.columns) > 0:` line.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: luigi/contrib/redshift.py

# The declaration of the class containing the buggy function
class S3CopyToTable(rdbms.CopyToTable, _CredentialsMixin):
    # This function from the same class is called by the buggy function
    def copy_options(self):
        # Please ignore the body of this function



    # this is the corrected version of the buggy function
    def copy(self, cursor, f):
        """
        Defines copying from s3 into redshift.
    
        If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
        """
        logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
        colnames = ''
        if self.columns is not None:
            if len(self.columns) > 0:
                colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
                colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)
    
        cursor.execute("""
         COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
         CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
         {options}
         ;""".format(
            table=self.table,
            colnames=colnames,
            source=f,
            creds=self._credentials(),
            options=self.copy_options)
        )
```

With this correction, the function will now properly handle the case where `self.columns` is `None`, preventing the `TypeError` that occurred before.
