### Analysis:
The error occurs because the `columns` attribute of the `DummyS3CopyToTableKey` instance is set to `None`, which causes the `TypeError` when trying to check its length in the `copy` function. This results in the line `if len(self.columns) > 0:` raising the `TypeError: object of type 'NoneType' has no len()`.

### Bug:
The bug is caused by not handling the case when the `columns` attribute is `None` in the `copy` function.

### Fix:
To fix the bug, we need to handle the case when `self.columns` is `None`. We can do this by checking if `self.columns` is `None` before trying to access its length. If `self.columns` is `None`, we can set `colnames` to an empty string directly.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns is not None:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

By checking if `self.columns` is not `None` before trying to access its length, we prevent the `TypeError` from occurring and handle the case appropriately.
