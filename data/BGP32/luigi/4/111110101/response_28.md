## Analysis
1. The error occurs because the `columns` attribute of the `DummyS3CopyToTableKey` instance is set to `None`, which causes the `TypeError: object of type 'NoneType' has no len()`.
2. The `colnames` variable is being constructed based on the `self.columns` attribute, but when it is `None`, the `len()` function cannot be applied to it.
3. The `colnames` variable should be an empty string when `self.columns` is `None`, which is the expected behavior.
4. To fix the bug, we need to check if `self.columns` is `None` and set `colnames` to an empty string in that case.

## Correction
```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns is not None:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

After applying this correction, the `copy` function should handle the case where `self.columns` is `None` correctly, preventing the `TypeError` from occurring.
