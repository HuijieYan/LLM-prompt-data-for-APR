## Analysis
1. The buggy function `copy` in the `S3CopyToTable` class is failing due to the `if len(self.columns) > 0` condition where `self.columns` is `None`.
2. The error message indicates a `TypeError` because `NoneType` does not have a `len()` function.
3. The expected behavior is to handle the case where `self.columns` is `None` and set `colnames` to an empty string in that scenario.
4. To fix the bug, we need to check if `self.columns` is not `None` before trying to get its length.

## Bug Fix
```python
    def copy(self, cursor, f):
        """
        Defines copying from s3 into redshift.
    
        If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
        """
        logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
        colnames = ''
        if self.columns is not None and len(self.columns) > 0:
            colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
            colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)
    
        cursor.execute("""
         COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
         CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
         {options}
         ;""".format(
            table=self.table,
            colnames=colnames,
            source=f,
            creds=self._credentials(),
            options=self.copy_options)
        )
```

By checking if `self.columns` is not `None` before attempting to get its length, we prevent the `TypeError` that occurred when `self.columns` was `None`. Now the function should handle the case when `self.columns` is `None` and set `colnames` to an empty string in that scenario, as expected.
