### Analysis
- The error message indicates a `TypeError` due to trying to determine the length of a `NoneType` object (self.columns is `None`).
- The buggy function `copy` is attempting to get the length of `self.columns` without checking if it is `None` or not.
- The expected behavior is to handle the case when `self.columns` is `None` gracefully without causing a `TypeError`.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to handle the case when `self.columns` is `None` before attempting to get its length. We can update the logic to check if `self.columns` is `None` and only generate `colnames` when there are valid column names present.

### Corrected Version of the Function

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns:  # Check if columns is not None
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    # You also need to call self.copy_options()
    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options())
    )
``` 

By making this change, the function will first check if `self.columns` is not `None` before trying to generate the `colnames` string from it. This will prevent the `TypeError` when `self.columns` is `None`.
