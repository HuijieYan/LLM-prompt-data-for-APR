## Bug Analysis
The bug in the `copy` function arises from trying to get the length of `self.columns` without handling the case when `self.columns` is `None`. This leads to a `TypeError: object of type 'NoneType' has no len()` when the buggy function is executed.

## Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to handle the case when `self.columns` is `None` by checking if it exists before trying to access its length.

## Corrected Version of the Function

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
``` 

By adding the condition `if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:`, we ensure that the length of `self.columns` is only accessed if `self.columns` exists and is not `None`, preventing the `TypeError` from occurring.
