## Bug Analysis
1. The buggy function `copy` in the `S3CopyToTable` class is intended to insert data from s3 into Redshift using a `COPY` statement.
2. The error occurs when trying to check the length of `self.columns`, which is `None`, causing a `TypeError` since `NoneType` does not support the `len()` operation.
3. The `copy` function expects `self.columns` to be a list of columns but encounters an issue due to a `None` value.
4. To fix the bug, we need to handle the case where `self.columns` is `None` by providing a default behavior in the function.

## Bug Fix
```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:  # Check if self.columns is not None before checking length
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

By making the adjustment above, the function will check if `self.columns` is not `None` before trying to get its length, avoiding the `TypeError` caused by accessing the length of a `NoneType`.
