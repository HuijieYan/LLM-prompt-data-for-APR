### Analysis
1. The buggy function `copy` is trying to check the length of `self.columns`, assuming it is a list. However, the test case provides `None` for the `columns` attribute of `DummyS3CopyToTableKey`, thus resulting in a `TypeError` when trying to get the length of `None`.
2. The expected behavior is to handle the case where `self.columns` can be `None`.
  
### Bug Cause
The bug occurs because the function assumes `self.columns` is a list and tries to get its length without checking for `None`.

### Fix Strategy
Modify the code to check if `self.columns` is `None` before checking its length.

### Corrected Version
```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```
