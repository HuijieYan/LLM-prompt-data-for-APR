Based on the error message and the failing test case, the bug is due to the fact that the `self.columns` attribute is `None`, causing an error when trying to get its length. To fix this bug, we need to include a check for `None` before trying to get the length of `self.columns`.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns is not None:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options())
    )
```

In the corrected version:
- We added a check for `self.columns is not None` before trying to get the length, to avoid the `TypeError`.
- We also called `self.copy_options()` function instead of `self.copy_options` to correctly execute the function.

This corrected version should now pass the failing test case. Let me know if you need further assistance.
