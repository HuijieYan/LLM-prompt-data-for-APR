## Bug Explanation
The error occurs because the buggy function is trying to check the length of a `None` value in `self.columns` using `len(self.columns)`. This causes a `TypeError` since a `NoneType` object cannot be used with the `len()` function.

## Bug Fix
To fix the bug, we need to handle the case where `self.columns` is `None` before attempting to get its length. We can modify the condition to check if `self.columns` is not `None` before proceeding with getting the length.

## The corrected version of the buggy function
```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns is not None and len(self.columns) > 0:  # Fix for handling NoneType
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options())
    )
```

By making this fix, the function will now correctly handle the case where `self.columns` is `None`, preventing the `TypeError` that occurred previously.
