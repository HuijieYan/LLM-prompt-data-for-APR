## Bug analysis:

The bug occurs in the `copy` function of the `S3CopyToTable` class. The bug is due to the fact that the function does not handle the case where `self.columns` is `None`. This leads to a `TypeError: object of type 'NoneType' has no len()` when trying to check the length of `self.columns`.

## Bug fix strategy:

To fix the bug, we need to add a check to ensure that `self.columns` is not `None` before trying to get its length. If `self.columns` is `None`, we will set `colnames` to an empty string to prevent the `TypeError`.

## Corrected code:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options())
    )
```

By adding the check `if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0`, we ensure that `colnames` is correctly populated only when `self.columns` is not `None`. This will prevent the `TypeError` that was occurring before.
