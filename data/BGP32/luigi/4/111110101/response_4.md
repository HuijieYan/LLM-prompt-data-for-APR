## Bug Analysis
The bug occurs in the `copy` function of the `S3CopyToTable` class in the `luigi/contrib/redshift.py` file. The issue arises when trying to determine the length of `self.columns`, which is set to `None`. This results in a `TypeError` when trying to check the length of a `NoneType` object.

## Bug Explanation
1. The test case `test_s3_copy_with_nonetype_columns` creates an instance of `DummyS3CopyToTableKey` with `columns` set to `None`.
2. During the execution of the `copy` function, there is a check `if len(self.columns) > 0`. Since `columns` is `None`, Python raises a `TypeError` because you can't determine the length of a `NoneType` object.

## Bug Fix Strategy
To fix this bug, we need to handle the case where `self.columns` is `None`. We can check if `self.columns` is `None` before trying to access its length. If `self.columns` is not `None`, we proceed to process it as usual.

## Corrected Version
```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns is not None:  # Check if self.columns is not None
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

By adding the `if self.columns is not None` check before accessing the length of `self.columns`, we ensure that we handle the case where `columns` is `None` gracefully. This corrected version should now pass the failing test case and prevent the `TypeError` from occurring.
