The bug in the provided function is due to the comparison `len(self.columns) > 0`, where `self.columns` is set to `None` in the `DummyS3CopyToTableKey` instance. This comparison causes a `TypeError` since `NoneType` does not have a `len()` method.

To fix this bug, we can check if `self.columns` is not `None` before trying to get its length.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns is not None and len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options())
    )
```

In this corrected version, we first check if `self.columns` is not `None` before trying to get its length. This way, we avoid the `TypeError` when comparing the length.

This fix will ensure that the function runs properly and passes the failing test case provided.
