## Correction

The bug in the provided function is caused by checking the length of `self.columns`, which is a `NoneType` object (null). To fix this, we need to handle the case where `self.columns` is `None` before attempting to get its length.

Here is the corrected version of the `copy` function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns is not None:
        colnames_list = [x[0] for x in self.columns if x]
        colnames = ",".join(colnames_list)
    
    if colnames:
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options())
    )
```

Explanation:
- We added a check to see if `self.columns` is `None` before trying to access its length. If `self.columns` is not `None`, we proceed to extract the column names from it.
- An additional check `if colnames:` is included to ensure `colnames` has non-empty values before formatting it for the SQL statement.

This corrected version should now handle the case where `self.columns` is `None` without causing a `TypeError`. It should pass the failing test case provided.
