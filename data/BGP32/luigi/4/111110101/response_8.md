The bug in the provided code is due to the comparison `if len(self.columns) > 0:` where `self.columns` is `None` resulting in a `TypeError` because `NoneType` does not have a length attribute.

To fix this bug, we need to check if `self.columns` is not `None` before comparing its length. If it is `None`, we can set `colnames` to an empty string directly.

Here is the corrected version of the `copy` function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns is not None:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options())
    )
```

This corrected version includes a check for `self.columns` being `None` before trying to access its length, preventing the `TypeError` from occurring.
