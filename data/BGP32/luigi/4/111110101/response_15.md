Based on the error message and the expected input values, the bug in the provided function is due to the `self.columns` being `None` and causing a `TypeError` when trying to check its length in the line `if len(self.columns) > 0:`.

To fix this issue, we need to check if `self.columns` is not `None` before trying to access its length. If `self.columns` is `None`, we can set `colnames` to an empty string directly.

Here is the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns is not None:  # Check if self.columns is not None
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options())
    )
```

In this corrected version, we added a check `if self.columns is not None:` before accessing the length of `self.columns`. This will prevent the `TypeError` caused by trying to get the length of `None`.

This corrected version should now pass the failing test case provided.
