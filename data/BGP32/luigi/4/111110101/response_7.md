The issue in the provided function is that the `self.columns` attribute is not checked for `None` before trying to use it in the `if len(self.columns) > 0:` statement. The error message indicates that the `NoneType` has no `len()` function, leading to a `TypeError`.

To fix this bug, we need to add a null check for the `columns` attribute before comparing its length. We can use the `is not None` condition to check if `self.columns` is not `None` before proceeding with the rest of the logic.

Here is the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    if self.columns is not None:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)
    else:
        colnames = ''
    
    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options())
    )
```

In this corrected version, we first check if `self.columns` is not `None` before trying to access its length. If it is `None`, we set `colnames` to an empty string. This approach ensures that the code executes without throwing a `TypeError`.

By making this adjustment, the function should now pass the failing test case provided.
