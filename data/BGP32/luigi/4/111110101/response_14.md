## Bug Explanation
The error occurs because the buggy function is trying to check the length of `self.columns`, which is `None`. This causes a `TypeError` since trying to get the length of a `NoneType` object is not allowed.

## Bug Fix
To fix the bug, we need to handle the case where `self.columns` is `None`. We can do this by checking if `self.columns` is `None` before trying to calculate the length. If `self.columns` is `None`, we can set `colnames` to an empty string directly.

## Corrected Version
```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns is not None:
        if len(self.columns) > 0:
            colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
            colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options())
    )
``` 

With this correction, the function should handle the case where `self.columns` is `None` and set `colnames` to an empty string to avoid the `TypeError`.
