## Analysis
1. The buggy function `copy` is failing due to the attempt to call `len` function on a `NoneType` object in `self.columns`.
2. The error message indicates a `TypeError: object of type 'NoneType' has no len()`.
3. The failing test case provides the expected values and types of variables, showing that `columns` is `None` which leads to the error.
4. To fix the bug, we need to handle the case where `self.columns` is `None` before attempting to get the length of it.
5. We should check if `self.columns` is not `None` before constructing the `colnames` string.

## Correction
```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns is not None:  # Check if self.columns is not None before using it
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options())
    )
```

By checking if `self.columns` is not `None` before processing it, we avoid the `TypeError` caused by trying to get the length of a `NoneType` object. This correction ensures that the code runs smoothly even when `self.columns` is `None`.
