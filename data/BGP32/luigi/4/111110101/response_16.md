The bug in the provided function is due to the comparison `if len(self.columns) > 0:` where `self.columns` is set to `None`. The comparison is trying to find the length of a `NoneType` object which causes a `TypeError`.

To fix this bug, we need to check if `self.columns` is `None` before trying to get its length. If it is `None`, then `colnames` should remain an empty string. 

Here is the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: luigi/contrib/redshift.py

# The declaration of the class containing the fixed function
class S3CopyToTable(rdbms.CopyToTable, _CredentialsMixin):
    """
    Template task for inserting a data set into Redshift from s3.
    
    Usage:
    
    * Subclass and override the required attributes:
    
      * `host`,
      * `database`,
      * `user`,
      * `password`,
      * `table`,
      * `columns`,
      * `s3_load_path`.
    
    * You can also override the attributes provided by the
      CredentialsMixin if they are not supplied by your
      configuration or environment variables.
    """


    # This function from the same class is called by the buggy function
    def copy_options(self):
        # Please ignore the body of this function



    # corrected version of the buggy function
    def copy(self, cursor, f):
        """
        Defines copying from s3 into redshift.
    
        If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
        """
        logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
        colnames = ''
        if self.columns is not None and len(self.columns) > 0:
            colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
            colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)
    
        cursor.execute("""
         COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
         CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
         {options}
         ;""".format(
            table=self.table,
            colnames=colnames,
            source=f,
            creds=self._credentials(),
            options=self.copy_options)
        )
```

With this correction, the function will not try to get the length of `self.columns` when it is `None`. This will prevent the `TypeError` that was occurring before.

The corrected function should now pass the failing test case provided.
