The bug in the provided `copy` function is caused by trying to check the length of `self.columns` without first verifying if it is not None, which leads to a `TypeError` when trying to call `len(None)`. To fix this issue, we need to add a condition to check if `self.columns` is not None before attempting to get its length.

Here is the corrected version of the `copy` function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns is not None and len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options())
    )
```

In the corrected version, we added `self.columns is not None and` before the condition to check the length of `self.columns`. This change ensures that we only attempt to get the length of `self.columns` if it is not None.

By making this modification, the `copy` function should now be able to handle cases where `self.columns` is None without throwing a `TypeError`. This correction should make the failing test pass as the function now properly handles the potentially None value of `self.columns`.
