## Analysis:
The buggy function `copy` in the `S3CopyToTable` class is failing when `self.columns` is None, resulting in a `TypeError: object of type 'NoneType' has no len()`. The issue seems to stem from how the `columns` attribute is handled in the `copy` function.

## Error Location:
The error is located in the `copy` function where it checks the length of `self.columns` without handling the case when `self.columns` is None.

## Cause of the Bug:
The buggy function fails when `self.columns` is None because it tries to access the length of `self.columns` without first checking if `self.columns` is None or not. This results in a `TypeError` when trying to iterate over a `NoneType` object.

## Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to check if `self.columns` is not None before attempting to access its length. This will prevent the `TypeError` from occurring when `self.columns` is None.

## Corrected Version:
```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

By adding the check `if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:`, we ensure that the code only tries to access the length of `self.columns` when it is not None. This fix addresses the issue reported in the GitHub bug and should now pass the failing test provided.
