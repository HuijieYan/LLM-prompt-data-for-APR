### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `copy` in the `S3CopyToTable` class of `luigi/contrib/redshift.py` is responsible for copying data from S3 into Redshift. The bug seems to be related to the handling of `self.columns` when it is `None`.
2. The failing test `test_s3_copy_with_nonetype_columns` in `test/contrib/redshift_test.py` sets `columns=None` for the task `DummyS3CopyToTableKey`.
3. The bug occurs when `self.columns` is `None` and the code tries to check its length directly without validating if it exists.
4. The bug is causing a `TypeError: object of type 'NoneType' has no len()`. To fix this, we need to first check if `self.columns` exists before checking its length.

### Bug Cause:
The bug occurs because the code does not check if `self.columns` exists before trying to get its length. When `self.columns` is `None`, directly checking `len(self.columns)` causes the `NoneType` object error.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we should modify the code to first check if `self.columns` exists before attempting to get its length. This will avoid the `NoneType` object error and correctly handle cases where `self.columns` is `None`.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options())
    )
```

By checking if `self.columns` exists before checking its length, the corrected version of the `copy` function should now handle cases where `self.columns` is `None` without causing any errors.
