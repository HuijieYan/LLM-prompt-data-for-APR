### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `copy` in the `S3CopyToTable` class is trying to format a SQL query string for copying data from S3 to Redshift. The issue is related to handling cases where `self.columns` is None.
2. The failing test function `test_s3_copy_with_nonetype_columns` is mocking the necessary objects and calling the `run` method of the `DummyS3CopyToTableKey` task, which eventually triggers the buggy `copy` function.
3. The bug causes a `TypeError: object of type 'NoneType' has no len()` because the code is directly trying to access `len(self.columns)` without properly handling the case where `self.columns` is None. The GitHub issue also suggests a solution to handle this scenario.
4. To fix the bug, we need to modify the `copy` function to handle the case where `self.columns` is None before trying to access its length.
5. We will update the code to check if `self.columns` is not None before attempting to get its length and only proceed with formatting the query if `self.columns` is not None.

### Corrected Version:
```python
class S3CopyToTable(rdbms.CopyToTable, _CredentialsMixin):

    def copy_options(self):
        # Please ignore the body of this function
    
    def copy(self, cursor, f):
        """
        Defines copying from s3 into redshift.
    
        If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
        """
        logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
        colnames = ''
        if self.columns is not None:  # Check if self.columns is not None
            colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
            colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)
    
        cursor.execute("""
         COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
         CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
         {options}
         ;""".format(
            table=self.table,
            colnames=colnames,
            source=f,
            creds=self._credentials(),
            options=self.copy_options())
        )
```

By adding the condition `if self.columns is not None:` before accessing the length of `self.columns`, we ensure that the code handles the scenario where `self.columns` is None properly. This change will resolve the `TypeError` when `self.columns` is None and the corrected version should now pass the failing test and address the GitHub issue.
