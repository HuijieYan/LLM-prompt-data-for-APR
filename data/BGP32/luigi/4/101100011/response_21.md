### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `copy` within the `S3CopyToTable` class is attempting to construct a query string for copying data from S3 to Redshift. It uses the `self.columns` attribute to determine the column names to include in the `COPY` query.
2. The failing test `test_s3_copy_with_nonetype_columns` is mocking the `S3CopyToTable` task with `columns=None`, causing the bug to be triggered due to `len(self.columns)` being called when `self.columns` is `None`.
3. The cause of the bug lies in the buggy function not handling the case where `self.columns` is `None`. This leads to the error `TypeError: object of type 'NoneType' has no len()`.
4. To fix the bug, we need to check if `self.columns` is not `None` before attempting to get its length in the `copy` function.
5. The fixed version is provided below:

### Bug Fix:
```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options())
    )
```

By adding the `if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:` condition, we prevent the `TypeError` that occurs when `self.columns` is `None`. This fix aligns with the suggested solution in the GitHub issue, ensuring that the code handles the case where `self.columns` is `None` appropriately.
