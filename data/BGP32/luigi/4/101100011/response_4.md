## Analysis:
1. The buggy function `copy` in the `S3CopyToTable` class is trying to execute a `COPY` statement to load data from S3 into Redshift. It is using the `self.columns` attribute to determine if column names need to be included in the SQL query.
2. The error is triggered when `self.columns` is `None`, leading to a `TypeError` when trying to get the length of `None`.
3. The GitHub issue suggests that the bug was introduced in the code change related to PR #2245, and proposes a potential fix by checking if `self.columns` is not None before trying to get its length.
4. To fix the bug, we need to modify the condition where the length of `self.columns` is checked to avoid the `TypeError`.
5. The corrected version of the `copy` function should explicitly check if `self.columns` is not None before trying to get its length.

## Bug Fix Strategy:
Modify the condition checking the length of `self.columns` in the `copy` function to prevent the `TypeError` when `self.columns` is `None`.

## Corrected Version:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:  # Check if self.columns is not None before getting its length
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options())
    )
```

In the corrected version:
- The condition `if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:` explicitly checks if `self.columns` is not None before checking its length to prevent the `TypeError`.
- The `self.copy_options` function should be properly called with `()`.
- This corrected version should address the issue reported in the GitHub bug and pass the failing test case.
