## Analysis:
1. The buggy function `copy` in the `S3CopyToTable` class is trying to construct a `COPY` SQL query for Redshift with specific columns, source, credentials, and options.
2. The bug seems to be related to how it handles the case when `self.columns` is `None`, leading to an error when trying to get the length of `self.columns`.
3. The provided test `test_s3_copy_with_nonetype_columns` is checking if the correct SQL query is being executed when `columns` are `None`, which is failing due to the bug in the `copy` function.
4. The GitHub issue suggests a solution to check if `self.columns` is not `None` before getting its length to avoid the `TypeError`.
5. To fix the bug, we need to modify the condition where the length of `self.columns` is checked to handle the case where `self.columns` may be `None`.

## Bug Fix Strategy:
- Modify the condition in the `copy` function to first check if `self.columns` is not `None` before attempting to get its length.
- If `self.columns` is not `None`, then proceed with constructing the `colnames` string as before.
- Update the `copy` function to handle `None` columns gracefully without causing any errors.

## Corrected Version:
```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns is not None and len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options())
    )
```

By making the above changes to the `copy` function, the bug should be fixed, and the corrected version should pass the failing test and resolve the issue reported on GitHub.
