## Analysis:
1. The buggy function `copy` in the `S3CopyToTable` class is trying to construct a SQL `COPY` statement to load data from S3 into Redshift. There seems to be an issue with checking if `self.columns` is empty or not.
2. The failing test `test_s3_copy_with_nonetype_columns` is mocking the necessary objects to test the `copy` function but encounters an error due to `self.columns` being `None`.
3. The GitHub issue mentions that passing `columns=None` to prevent table creation results in a `TypeError` due to checking the length of `self.columns`, which is `None`.
4. The suggested fix in the GitHub issue is to modify the condition to `if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0` instead of just checking `if len(self.columns) > 0`.
   
## Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Update the `copy` function to check if `self.columns` is not `None` before trying to access its length.
2. Ensure that the `colnames` variable is constructed correctly based on whether `self.columns` is provided or not.
3. Make the necessary adjustments to handle the case where `self.columns` is `None` gracefully.

## Corrected Version:
```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames) if colnames else ''

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options())
    )
```

In the corrected version, the `copy` function now correctly checks if `self.columns` is not `None` before trying to access its length. This modification ensures that the `colnames` variable is constructed appropriately based on the condition. The function now calls `self.copy_options()` to fetch the copy options.
