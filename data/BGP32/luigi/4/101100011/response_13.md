### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `copy` in the `S3CopyToTable` class within `luigi/contrib/redshift.py` is failing when `self.columns` is `None`.
2. The failing test `test_s3_copy_with_nonetype_columns` in `test/contrib/redshift_test.py` is mocking the behavior where `columns=None` is passed to the `DummyS3CopyToTableKey` task, triggering the bug.
3. The GitHub issue mentions that the bug is related to a change in behavior introduced in a specific pull request related to how the length of `self.columns` is being checked.
4. The bug occurs because `self.columns` is being directly accessed without checking if it is `None`, leading to a `TypeError` when trying to get its length.

### Bug Explanation:
The bug occurs in the `copy` function when attempting to fetch the length of `self.columns` without checking if it is `None`. This triggers a `TypeError` when trying to iterate over `self.columns` when it is `None`.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that we explicitly check if `self.columns` is not `None` before trying to access its length.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options())
    )
```

### Summary:
The corrected version of the `copy` function adds a check for `self.columns` to ensure it is not `None` before trying to access its length. This modification addresses the `TypeError` that occurs when `self.columns` is `None`, fixing the bug as reported in the GitHub issue.
