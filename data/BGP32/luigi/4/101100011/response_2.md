### Analysis:
The buggy function `copy` in the `S3CopyToTable` class within `luigi/contrib/redshift.py` is failing when the `columns` attribute is `None`. The failing test case `test_s3_copy_with_nonetype_columns` in `test/contrib/redshift_test.py` highlights the issue. The bug seems to be related to the incorrect handling of `None` value for `self.columns`.

### Potential Error Locations:
1. The line `if len(self.columns) > 0:` can cause a `TypeError` if `self.columns` is `None`.
2. The usage of `self.copy_options` might not return an expected value.

### Cause of the Bug:
The bug occurs when the `columns` attribute in the `S3CopyToTable` task is `None`. The code tries to get the length of `self.columns` without first checking if it is `None`, leading to a `TypeError`. The GitHub issue suggests a possible fix by checking for `self.columns` before getting its length.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Check if `self.columns` is not `None` before getting its length.
2. Ensure that `self.copy_options` returns the appropriate value.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options())
    )
```

### Explanation:
The corrected version of the `copy` function now checks if `self.columns` is not `None` before trying to get its length. Additionally, `self.copy_options()` is now correctly called as a method to ensure it returns the expected value. This correction should address the `TypeError` issue when `columns` is `None` as highlighted in the failing test case and the GitHub issue.
