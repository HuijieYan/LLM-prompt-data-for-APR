### Analysis:
- The buggy function `copy` is trying to construct a SQL `COPY` statement based on the provided parameters, including `columns`.
- The failing test `test_s3_copy_with_nonetype_columns` is mocking the `columns` parameter as `None`, which leads to the `TypeError: object of type 'NoneType' has no len()` error.
- The GitHub issue suggests checking if `self.columns` is not `None` before trying to get its length.
- The bug occurs when the `columns` parameter is `None`, causing the `len()` function to fail.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
- Modify the `copy` function to check if `self.columns` is not `None` before trying to calculate its length.
- Update the SQL statement construction to handle the case where `self.columns` is `None`.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns is not None and len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options())
    )
```

By making these changes to the `copy` function, we ensure that it can handle the case where `self.columns` is `None`, preventing the `TypeError` and resolving the issue reported on GitHub.
