## Analysis:
1. The buggy function `copy()` in the `S3CopyToTable` class of `redshift.py` is attempting to format a `COPY` SQL query but encounters a bug due to the `colnames` variable being calculated incorrectly.
2. The bug arises from the `colnames` variable not being properly checked for `None` before trying to extract values from it.
3. The failing test `test_s3_copy_with_nonetype_columns` is designed to test the behavior of the `copy()` function when `columns=None`. It expects the `colnames` in the SQL query to be empty but encounters a `TypeError: object of type 'NoneType' has no len()` due to the buggy code.
4. To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the `colnames` variable is only formatted when it contains actual column names, and the formatting of the `COPY` query includes an empty string for `colnames` when no columns are provided.

## Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Check if `self.columns` is not `None` before trying to extract column names to populate `colnames`.
2. Update the `COPY` SQL query formatting to include an empty string for `colnames` when no columns are provided.

## Corrected Version:
```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options())
    )
```

By making the above corrections, the bug in the `copy()` function should be fixed, and the test case `test_s3_copy_with_nonetype_columns` should now pass without any errors related to `NoneType` and `len()` issues.
