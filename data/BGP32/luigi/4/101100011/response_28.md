### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `copy` in the `S3CopyToTable` class is using `len(self.columns)` without checking if `self.columns` is `None` which is causing the `TypeError: object of type 'NoneType' has no len()`.
2. The failing test `test_s3_copy_with_nonetype_columns` is mocking a scenario where `columns` is `None` and calling the `run` method on the `S3CopyToTable` task, triggering the bug.
3. The GitHub issue highlights the root cause as the incorrect handling of `self.columns` in the `copy` function and suggests a fix to check for `self.columns` being `None`.
4. The strategy for fixing the bug would be to add a condition to check if `self.columns` is not `None` before trying to access its length.

### Bug Fix:
```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:  # Fixing the bug by adding a check for None
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

By adding the check `if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:` in the `copy` function, we ensure that the code only tries to access the length of `self.columns` when it is not `None`, fixing the bug reported in the GitHub issue.
