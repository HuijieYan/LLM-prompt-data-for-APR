## Analysis:
1. The buggy function `copy` in the `S3CopyToTable` class in `luigi/contrib/redshift.py` is attempting to format a SQL query using the `copy_options` method but is not actually calling it. This leads to a TypeError when trying to concatenate a function (`self.copy_options`) with a string in the `cursor.execute` call.
2. The failing test `test_s3_copy_with_nonetype_columns` in `test/contrib/redshift_test.py` is trying to call the `copy` method with `columns=None`.
3. The GitHub issue mentions that providing `columns=None` to prevent table creation is causing the bug due to incorrect handling of the `self.columns` attribute in `S3CopyToTable.copy` function.
4. To fix the bug, the condition `if len(self.columns) > 0:` should be changed to `if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:` to handle the case where `self.columns` is None.

## Bug Fix:
Here is the corrected version of the `copy` function in `S3CopyToTable` class:

```python
# The corrected version of the buggy function
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options())
    )
```

By adding the condition `if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:`, we ensure that `self.columns` is not None before trying to access its length. This change will prevent the TypeError and resolve the issue mentioned in the GitHub report.
