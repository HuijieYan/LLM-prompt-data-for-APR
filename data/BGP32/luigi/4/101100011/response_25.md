## Analysis:
The buggy function `copy()` in the `S3CopyToTable` class in the `luigi/contrib/redshift.py` file is failing due to a TypeError when `self.columns` is None. The failing test `test_s3_copy_with_nonetype_columns` in `test/contrib/redshift_test.py` is not handling the `columns` being None correctly.

The GitHub issue reports that the bug is causing failures when `columns` are not provided, resulting in a TypeError. The suggested solution in the GitHub issue is to update the condition to check if `self.columns` is not None before checking its length.

## Error Location:
The error is occurring in the line:
```python
if len(self.columns) > 0:
```
Since `self.columns` may be None, trying to get the length of None raises a TypeError.

## Cause of the Bug:
The bug is caused by not handling the case where `self.columns` is None properly in the `copy()` function. The failing test in `redshift_test.py` is passing `columns=None`, triggering the TypeError when expecting a list for `self.columns`.

## Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to update the condition in the `copy()` function to first check if `self.columns` is not None before checking its length. This way, we can avoid the TypeError when `self.columns` is None.

## Corrected Version:
```python
# The corrected version of the buggy function

class S3CopyToTable(rdbms.CopyToTable, _CredentialsMixin):
    
    # Existing function is not changed
    def copy_options(self):
        # Please ignore the body of this function
        pass
    
    def copy(self, cursor, f):
        """
        Defines copying from s3 into redshift.
    
        If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
        """
        logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
        colnames = ''
        if self.columns is not None and len(self.columns) > 0:
            colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
            colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)
    
        cursor.execute("""
         COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
         CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
         {options}
         ;""".format(
            table=self.table,
            colnames=colnames,
            source=f,
            creds=self._credentials(),
            options=self.copy_options)
        )
```

By updating the condition `if self.columns is not None and len(self.columns) > 0:`, we can prevent the TypeError when `self.columns` is None. This correction ensures that the function works correctly even when `columns` are not provided.

This corrected version should pass the failing test and address the issue reported on GitHub.
