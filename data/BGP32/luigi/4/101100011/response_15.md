### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `copy` in the `S3CopyToTable` class of `luigi/contrib/redshift.py` is failing to handle the case when `self.columns` is `None`.
2. The failing test in `test/contrib/redshift_test.py` is specifically testing this scenario by passing `None` as the `columns` parameter to `DummyS3CopyToTableKey`.
3. The GitHub issue indicates that the bug was introduced in luigi 2.7.1 and suggests a solution by checking `if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0` instead of `if len(self.columns) > 0`.

### Bug Cause:
The bug occurs because when `self.columns` is `None`, the code tries to check the length of `None` which results in the `TypeError: object of type 'NoneType' has no len()`.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Modify the condition where the length of `self.columns` is checked to also include a check for `self.columns` being not `None`.
2. Check for `if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0` instead of just `if len(self.columns) > 0`.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options())
    )
```

By making this change, the `copy` function will now handle the scenario where `self.columns` is `None` without causing an error, resolving the bug identified in the failing test and the GitHub issue.
