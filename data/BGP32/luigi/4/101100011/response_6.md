## Analysis:
1. The buggy function `copy` is trying to construct a SQL `COPY` statement for Redshift, but it is failing when `self.columns` is None.
2. The failing test `test_s3_copy_with_nonetype_columns` is testing the behavior when `columns` is None in the task, which triggers the bug.
3. The GitHub issue indicates that the bug was introduced in version 2.7.1 of Luigi due to a specific conditional check in the code.
4. The cause of the bug is the direct usage of `len(self.columns)` without checking if `self.columns` is not None.
5. A possible solution is to add an additional check `if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:` to handle cases where `self.columns` is None.

## Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Update the `copy` function to handle the case where `self.columns` is None by adding a conditional check.
2. Modify the conditional statement to check whether `self.columns` is not None before checking its length.

## Corrected Version of the Function:

```python
# The corrected version of the buggy function
class S3CopyToTable(rdbms.CopyToTable, _CredentialsMixin):
    
    def copy(self, cursor, f):
        """
        Defines copying from s3 into redshift.
    
        If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
        """
        logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
        colnames = ''
        if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:
            colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
            colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)
    
        cursor.execute("""
         COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
         CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
         {options}
         ;""".format(
            table=self.table,
            colnames=colnames,
            source=f,
            creds=self._credentials(),
            options=self.copy_options)
        )
```

By updating the `copy` function as shown above, the bug related to `self.columns` being None should be fixed, and the function should pass the failing test and resolve the issue reported on GitHub.
