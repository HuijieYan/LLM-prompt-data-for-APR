### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `copy` in the `S3CopyToTable` class is attempting to construct a SQL query for copying data from S3 to Redshift. However, it is not handling the case where `columns` is set to `None`, resulting in a `TypeError` due to trying to get the length of `None`.
2. The failing test `test_s3_copy_with_nonetype_columns` is mocking the behavior of the `S3CopyToTable` class and expects a specific SQL query to be executed on the cursor when `columns` is `None`.
3. The GitHub issue indicates that the bug is caused by not handling the case where `columns` is `None`, and it suggests modifying the condition to check if `self.columns` exists before checking its length.
4. The strategy for fixing the bug would be to modify the condition in the `copy` function to first check if `self.columns` is not `None` before attempting to get its length.

### Bug Fix:
```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into Redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns is not None and len(self.columns) > 0:  # Fix check for None before getting length
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

By updating the check for `None` before getting the length of `self.columns`, the bug causing the `TypeError` when `columns` is `None` should be resolved. This fix aligns with the suggested solution in the GitHub issue. The corrected version of the `copy` function should now pass the failing test and address the issue reported in GitHub.
