## Analysis:
1. The `S3CopyToTable` class in `redshift.py` contains a buggy `copy` function that is causing an issue when trying to run Redshift COPY jobs with `columns = None`.
2. The failing test in `redshift_test.py` is trying to mock the `S3CopyToTable` task and check if the `execute` method is called with the correct parameters.
3. The GitHub issue indicates that the root cause of the bug is in the condition `if len(self.columns) > 0` which throws a `TypeError` when `columns` is `None`.

## Potential error location:
The bug is likely occurring in the following line of the `copy` function:
```python
if len(self.columns) > 0:
```
The above condition is causing an issue when `self.columns` is `None`, resulting in a `TypeError`.

## Bug cause:
The bug is caused by trying to get the length of `self.columns` without checking if it is `None` first. When `self.columns` is `None`, trying to get its length results in a `TypeError`. The suggested solution in the GitHub issue is to modify the condition to `if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0`.

## Strategy for fixing the bug:
To fix the bug, we need to modify the condition to first check if `self.columns` is not `None` before checking its length. This will prevent the `TypeError` when `columns` is `None`.

## Corrected version of the buggy function:
```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into Redshift.
    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''

    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options())
    )
```

By updating the condition to `if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0`, we ensure that we only try to get the length of `self.columns` if it is not `None`. This fix will resolve the `TypeError` issue when running Redshift COPY jobs with `columns = None`.
