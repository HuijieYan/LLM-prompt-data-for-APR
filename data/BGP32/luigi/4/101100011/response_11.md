## Analysis:
1. The buggy function `copy` in the `S3CopyToTable` class within `luigi.contrib.redshift.py` is responsible for copying data from S3 to Redshift but is failing when `self.columns` is `None`.
2. The bug occurs because the length of `self.columns` is checked without verifying if `self.columns` is `None`, leading to the `TypeError: object of type 'NoneType' has no len()`.
3. The failing test `test_s3_copy_with_nonetype_columns` in `redshift_test.py` passes `columns=None` to the task `DummyS3CopyToTableKey`, triggering the bug during the Redshift COPY operation.
4. To fix the bug, we need to modify the condition checking for the existence of `self.columns` before trying to determine its length. This change will prevent the `TypeError` when `self.columns` is `None`.

## Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Update the `copy` method in the `S3CopyToTable` class to check if `self.columns` is not None before attempting to get its length. This will prevent the `TypeError` when `self.columns` is `None`.
2. Update the `copy` method in `luigi.contrib.redshift.py` as per the suggested solution in the GitHub issue, changing the condition to `if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0`.

## Corrected Version of the `copy` function:
```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from S3 into Redshift.
    
    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)
    
    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

By making this change in the `copy` method, the bug related to `NoneType` error when `columns=None` should be resolved, and the test `test_s3_copy_with_nonetype_columns` should pass without any issues.
