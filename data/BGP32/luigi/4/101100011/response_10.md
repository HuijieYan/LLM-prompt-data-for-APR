### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `copy` in the `S3CopyToTable` class in `redshift.py` is trying to construct a SQL `COPY` statement for Redshift. It uses the `self.columns` attribute to determine whether to include column names in the `COPY` statement.
2. The failing test `test_s3_copy_with_nonetype_columns` in `redshift_test.py` is trying to test the functionality of the `S3CopyToTable` task when `columns` is `None`.
3. The GitHub issue highlights that the bug occurs when `columns` is `None`, causing a `TypeError` due to trying to get the length of `None`. The proposed fix is to check `if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:` instead of directly checking `if len(self.columns) > 0:`.
4. The bug can be fixed by changing the condition to handle the case when `self.columns` is `None` before attempting to get its length.

### Bug Cause:
The bug occurs because the buggy function `copy` directly tries to get the length of `self.columns` without checking if it is `None`. When `columns` is `None`, it results in a `TypeError` as `NoneType` has no length attribute.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
- Modify the condition to check if `self.columns` is not `None` before trying to get its length.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

With this correction, the function will now handle the case where `self.columns` is `None`, preventing the `TypeError` and resolving the bug identified in the GitHub issue.
