## Analysis:
1. The buggy function `copy` within the `S3CopyToTable` class is responsible for copying data from S3 into Redshift. The issue arises when `self.columns` is None, causing a `TypeError` due to the attempt to get the length of a `NoneType`.
2. The failing test is specifically designed to test the scenario where `columns=None`, triggering the bug in the `copy` function.
3. The GitHub issue mentions the root cause stemming from a specific change in the code related to handling `self.columns`. The suggested solution involves checking if `self.columns` is not None before proceeding to check its length.
4. To fix the bug, we need to modify the condition for checking the length of `self.columns` to prevent the `TypeError` when it is None.

## Bug Fix Strategy:
Modify the condition for checking the length of `self.columns` to ensure that it is not None before attempting to get its length.

## Corrected Version:
```python
# The corrected version of the buggy function
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns is not None and len(self.columns) > 0:  # Check if self.columns is not None
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

By making this simple modification to the condition checking for `self.columns`, the bug related to copying data from S3 to Redshift when `columns=None` should be resolved.
