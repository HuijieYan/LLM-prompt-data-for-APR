Analysis:
1. The buggy function `copy` in the `S3CopyToTable` class within `luigi/contrib/redshift.py` is causing a `TypeError` when `self.columns` is `None`.
2. The bug is caused by the line `if len(self.columns) > 0` assuming that `self.columns` is always a list, but when it is `None`, it raises an error.
3. The failing test `test_s3_copy_with_nonetype_columns` expects that the `COPY` query will be executed correctly without specifying any columns. However, due to the buggy function, the `TypeError` occurs.
4. To fix the bug, we need to check if `self.columns` is not `None` before attempting to access its length in the `copy` function.
5. Additionally, the `copy_options` method is not being called in the `cursor.execute` statement. It should be `self.copy_options()`.

Corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
class S3CopyToTable(rdbms.CopyToTable, _CredentialsMixin):
    def copy_options(self):
        # Please ignore the body of this function

    def copy(self, cursor, f):
        """
        Defines copying from s3 into redshift.
    
        If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
        """
        logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
        colnames = ''
        
        if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:
            colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
            colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)
    
        cursor.execute("""
         COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
         CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
         {options}
         ;""".format(
            table=self.table,
            colnames=colnames,
            source=f,
            creds=self._credentials(),
            options=self.copy_options())
        )
```

By updating the `if` condition to check if `self.columns` is not `None`, we prevent the `TypeError` from occurring. Also, calling `self.copy_options()` in the `cursor.execute` statement ensures that the copy options are correctly included in the query. This corrected version should now pass the failing test and resolve the GitHub issue related to the bug in the Redshift COPY operation in Luigi 2.7.1.
