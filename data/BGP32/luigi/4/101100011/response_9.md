### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `copy` in the `S3CopyToTable` class is responsible for executing the `COPY` command from S3 to Redshift. It uses the `copy_options` function to generate additional copy options but fails to call it correctly.
2. The bug occurs when `self.columns` is `None`, which results in a `TypeError` due to trying to get the length of `None`.
3. The failing test `test_s3_copy_with_nonetype_columns` mocks the necessary objects and expects the `COPY` command to be executed with the correct parameters. However, due to the bug in the `copy` function, the test fails.
4. To fix the bug, we need to properly handle the case when `self.columns` is `None` in the `copy` function, as suggested in the GitHub issue.
5. The corrected version of the function is provided below.

### Corrected Function:
```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from S3 into Redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:  # Fix for handling NoneType
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options())  # Correctly call copy_options method
    )
```

By making the suggested change in the `copy` function above, the bug causing the `TypeError` when `self.columns` is `None` will be fixed, and the corrected version should pass the failing test case.
