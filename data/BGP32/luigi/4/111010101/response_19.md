### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `copy` is supposed to insert a data set into Redshift from an S3 location. However, the bug is caused by trying to check the length of `self.columns`, which is `None`, leading to a `TypeError`.
2. The error occurs in the line `if len(self.columns) > 0:` where `self.columns` is `None`.
3. The error message indicates that an object of type `NoneType` has no length, which means we are trying to perform a length check on a `None` value.
4. To fix the bug, we need to handle the case where `self.columns` is `None` by checking if it is not `None` before trying to get its length.
5. The corrected function should handle the case of `self.columns` being `None` gracefully before proceeding with the rest of the logic.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    
    if self.columns is not None and len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options())
    )
```

This corrected version first checks if `self.columns` is not `None` before proceeding with getting its length and performing further operations.
