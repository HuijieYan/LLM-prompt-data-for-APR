### Analysis
1. The error occurs due to trying to find the length of `self.columns`, which is `None`.
2. The `copy` function is attempting to construct a query string using `self.columns`, but it does not handle the case where `self.columns` is `None`.
3. The error message indicates that an attempt to get the length of a `NoneType` object (`self.columns`) has caused a `TypeError`.
4. To fix the bug, we need to check if `self.columns` is not `None` before trying to construct the `colnames` variable.
5. We can modify the `copy` function to include this check.

### Corrected Version of the Function

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:  # Check if self.columns is not None and contains elements
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

By adding the check `if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:`, we ensure that the `colnames` variable is constructed only when `self.columns` is not `None`. This correction should prevent the `TypeError` and allow the function to execute successfully.
