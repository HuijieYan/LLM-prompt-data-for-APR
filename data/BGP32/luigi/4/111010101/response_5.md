### Analyzing the buggy function

1. **Bug Location**: The error is occurring in the `copy` function of the `S3CopyToTable` class.
   
2. **Cause of Bug**: The error message `TypeError: object of type 'NoneType' has no len()` indicates that the `self.columns` attribute is None at the time when the `if len(self.columns) > 0` statement is trying to check its length.
   
3. **Expected Behavior**: The function should handle the case where `self.columns` is None and not throw a TypeError. In this case, when columns are not provided, it should default to an empty string for the `colnames`.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug
To fix the bug, we need to check if `self.columns` is not None before trying to access its length. If it is None, we set `colnames` to an empty string.

### Corrected Version of the Function

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into Redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns is not None:  # Check if columns are not None
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options())
    )
```

By making this change, we ensure that the code can handle the scenario where `self.columns` is None, preventing the TypeError and correctly setting `colnames` to an empty string.
