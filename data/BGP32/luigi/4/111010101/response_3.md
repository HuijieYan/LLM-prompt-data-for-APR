### Analysis
1. The buggy function `copy` is trying to check the length of `self.columns` which is causing a `TypeError` when `self.columns` is `None`.
2. The error message indicates that the issue is at line 338 where `if len(self.columns) > 0:` is trying to operate on a `NoneType`.
3. The expected input values are `f`, a string, and `self`, an instance of `DummyS3CopyToTableKey` with `columns` as `None`. The expected output is the execution of the SQL `COPY` command with correct parameters.
4. To fix the bug, we need to handle the case when `self.columns` is `None` before trying to access its length.

### Bug Fix Strategy
We need to check if `self.columns` is `None` before checking its length. If it is `None`, we can handle it by setting `colnames` as an empty string. If it is not `None`, we can proceed with the existing logic.

### Corrected Version
```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns is not None:  # Check if self.columns is not None
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options())
    )
```

By adding the check `if self.columns is not None`, we ensure that we only try to access the length of `self.columns` when it is not `None`. This should fix the `TypeError` caused by trying to access the length of a `NoneType`.
