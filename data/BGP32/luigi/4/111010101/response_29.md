### Analyzing the buggy function

1. **Relation to Buggy Class and Related Functions**:
   - The buggy function `copy` is a method of the class `S3CopyToTable` in the `luigi/contrib/redshift.py` file.
   - The class provides a template task for inserting a dataset into Redshift from S3.

2. **Identifying Potential Error Locations**:
   - The error occurs at `if len(self.columns) > 0:` where `self.columns` is expected to be a list but is `None`.

3. **Explanation of the Bug**:
   - The error message `TypeError: object of type 'NoneType' has no len()` indicates that `self.columns` is `None`, and the code is trying to get the length of `None` which leads to a `TypeError`.
   - The function should handle the case where `self.columns` is `None` to avoid this error.

4. **Strategy for Fixing the Bug**:
   - Check if `self.columns` is `None` before checking its length.
   - Provide a default behavior if `self.columns` is `None` to prevent the `TypeError`.

### Corrected Version of the Function

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from S3 into Redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    
    if self.columns is None:
        colnames = ''
    else:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options())
    )

# Fixes Made:
# - Added a check to see if self.columns is None before trying to get its length.
# - Provided a default behavior by setting colnames to an empty string if self.columns is None.
# - Changed self.copy_options to self.copy_options() to actually call the copy_options method.
``` 

By making these changes, the corrected function should now handle the case where `self.columns` is `None`, preventing the `TypeError` from occurring.
