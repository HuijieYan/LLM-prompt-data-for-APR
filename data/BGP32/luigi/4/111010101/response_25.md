### Analysis
1. The error occurs due to the `columns` attribute being `None` in the `DummyS3CopyToTableKey` instance passed to the `copy` function.
2. The buggy function tries to check the length of `self.columns` without handling the case when `self.columns` is `None`, leading to a `TypeError`.
3. The error message and the failing test clearly show that the root cause is trying to get the length of a `NoneType` object.
4. To fix the bug, we need to handle the case when `self.columns` is `None` by explicitly checking for it before trying to access its length.

### Bug Fix
```python
    def copy(self, cursor, f):
        """
        Defines copying from s3 into redshift.
    
        If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
        """
        logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
        colnames = ''
        if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:  # Check if self.columns is not None before getting its length
            colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
            colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)
    
        cursor.execute("""
         COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
         CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
         {options}
         ;""".format(
            table=self.table,
            colnames=colnames,
            source=f,
            creds=self._credentials(),
            options=self.copy_options())
        )
```

This fix involves explicitly checking if `self.columns` is not `None` before attempting to get its length in the `copy` function. This change ensures that the code does not break if `self.columns` is `None`.
