### Analysis
1. The error occurs due to trying to check the length of `self.columns`, which is a `NoneType`.
2. The `columns` parameter in the `DummyS3CopyToTableKey` class is set as `None`, causing the error when checking its length in the `copy` function.
3. The error message indicates a `TypeError` because `NoneType` does not support the `len()` function.
4. To fix the bug, we need to handle the case when `self.columns` is `None` before trying to access its length.

### Solution
We can fix the bug by explicitly checking if `self.columns` is not `None` before trying to access its length. If it is `None`, we can handle that scenario appropriately.

### Corrected Version
```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns is not None:  # Check if self.columns is not None
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options())
    )
```

In the corrected version, we added a check `if self.columns is not None` before trying to access the length of `self.columns`. This change ensures that the program does not encounter a `TypeError` when `self.columns` is `None`.
