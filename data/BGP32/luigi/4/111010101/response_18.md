### Analysis
1. The error is occurring due to the `self.columns` being `None` in the `DummyS3CopyToTableKey` instance, causing a TypeError when trying to check the length of `self.columns`.
2. The buggy function `copy` is expecting `self.columns` to be a list of columns, and when it is `None`, it fails to check its length.
3. The error message clearly states that the issue is with `TypeError: object of type 'NoneType' has no len()`.
4. To fix the bug, we need to check if `self.columns` is `None` before trying to access its length. If it is `None`, we should handle it appropriately.

### Bug Fix
Here is the corrected version of the `copy` function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns is not None and len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options())
    )
```

By adding a check `if self.columns is not None` before checking the length, we ensure that the code doesn't throw a TypeError when `self.columns` is `None`.

This corrected version should now pass the failing test and satisfy the expected input/output values.
