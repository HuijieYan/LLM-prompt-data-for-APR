### Bug Analysis
- The error message indicates a `TypeError` due to trying to take the length of a `NoneType` object.
- The buggy function is attempting to check the length of `self.columns` which is set to `None`.
- The expected behavior is for the function to handle the case when `self.columns` is `None` gracefully.

### Bug Fix Strategy
- Check if `self.columns` is `None` before trying to get its length.
- If `self.columns` is `None`, handle this case appropriately without causing a `TypeError`.

### Corrected Version of the Code
```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:  # Check if self.columns is not None
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options())
    )
```

### Explanation of the Changes
- Added a check `if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0` to ensure `self.columns` is not `None` before attempting to get its length.
- Changed `self.copy_options` to `self.copy_options()` to correctly call the `copy_options` function.
