### Analysis
1. The error occurs because `self.columns` is `None`, causing a `TypeError` when trying to get the length of `None`.
2. The `copy_options` function is not being called properly in the `COPY` statement.
3. The `copy_options` function should have been invoked as a method `self.copy_options()` instead of just `self.copy_options`.
4. To fix the bug, we need to ensure that `self.columns` is properly checked for `None` before accessing its length, and invoke `self.copy_options()` correctly.
5. Also, we need to handle the case where `self.columns` is `None` by setting `colnames` to an empty string in the case of `None`.

### Corrected Version
```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns is not None:  # Check for None before accessing length
        if len(self.columns) > 0:
            colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
            colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)
    
    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options())  # Correctly call the copy_options method here
    )
``` 

By making these changes, the function will properly handle the case where `self.columns` is `None`, preventing the `TypeError` from occurring.
