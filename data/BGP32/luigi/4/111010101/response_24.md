### Analyzing the buggy function

The buggy function `copy` within the `S3CopyToTable` class in the `luigi/contrib/redshift.py` file is failing due to a `TypeError` when trying to determine the length of `self.columns`, which is `None`.

#### Potential Error Location
The error occurs during the check of the length of `self.columns` in the `copy` function of the `S3CopyToTable` class.

#### Cause of the Bug
The root cause of the bug is that the `columns` attribute of the `S3CopyToTable` class is being set to `None` instead of an actual list of columns. This causes the `if len(self.columns) > 0:` check within the `copy` function to fail with a `TypeError`.

#### Strategy for Fixing the Bug
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the `columns` attribute of the `S3CopyToTable` class is always set to a list of columns, even if that list is empty. This can be achieved by handling the case where `self.columns` is `None` within the `copy` function.

### Corrected Version of the Buggy Function
```python
# Fixing the buggy function
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    
    if self.columns is not None and len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

### Expected Outcome
With the corrected version of the `copy` function provided above, the function will now handle the case where `self.columns` is `None` appropriately. This change ensures that the `TypeError` caused by trying to get the length of `None` is avoided, and the function should now pass the failing test case.
