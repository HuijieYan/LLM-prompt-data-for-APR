### Analysis
The error occurs because the `columns` attribute is set to `None`. When checking the length of `self.columns`, the code throws a `TypeError` since `NoneType` objects do not have a length.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to check if `self.columns` is not `None` before trying to access its length. We can use a simple `if` statement to handle this case.

### Code Correction
```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns is not None and len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options())
    )
```

With this fix, the code will first check if `self.columns` is not `None` before trying to access its length, avoiding the `TypeError` that was occurring. Now, the corrected function should pass the failing test with the expected input/output values provided.
