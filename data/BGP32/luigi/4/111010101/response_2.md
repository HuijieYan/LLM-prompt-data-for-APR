### Analysis
1. The error occurs due to trying to call `len()` on `self.columns`, which is `None`, resulting in a `TypeError`.
2. The buggy function `copy()` is expecting `self.columns` to be a list and tries to extract column names from it to use in the SQL query.
3. When `self.columns` is `None`, the buggy function does not handle this case and directly tries to access the length of `None`.
4. To fix the bug, we need to check if `self.columns` is `None` and handle it appropriately by setting `colnames` to an empty string in that case.

### Bug Fix Strategy
1. Check if `self.columns` is `None` before trying to access its length.
2. If `self.columns` is `None`, set `colnames` to an empty string.
3. Refactor the code to handle the case when `self.columns` is `None`.

### Corrected Version
```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns is not None:  # Check if self.columns is not None
        if len(self.columns) > 0:
            colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
            colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)
    
    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options())
    )
```

By adding a check for `self.columns` being `None` and handling it appropriately, the corrected version of the function should now handle the case when `self.columns` is `None` without causing a `TypeError`.
