### Analysis
- The error message indicates a `TypeError: object of type 'NoneType' has no len()` occurring at line 338 when trying to determine the length of `self.columns`.
- From the error message, we know that `self.columns` is `None`, which causes the `TypeError`.
- The buggy function is trying to construct a string `colnames` by joining the column names from `self.columns`, but it does not handle the case when `self.columns` is `None`.

### Bug
The bug occurs in the `copy` function when attempting to check the length of `self.columns` without ensuring that it is not `None`. This leads to a `TypeError`.

### Fix
To fix the bug, we need to check if `self.columns` is `None` before trying to determine its length. If it is `None`, we should assign an empty list to `colnames` instead of trying to join the elements.

### Corrected Version
```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns is not None:  # Check if self.columns is not None
        if len(self.columns) > 0:
            colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
            colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

With this change, we check if `self.columns` is not `None` before checking its length to avoid the `TypeError`. This corrected version should now handle the case when `self.columns` is `None`.
