### Analysis
1. The error occurs when trying to check the length of `self.columns`, which is `None` instead of a list. This leads to a `TypeError` as `NoneType` does not have a `len()` function.
2. The `columns=None` parameter in the `DummyS3CopyToTableKey` class is causing the issue.
3. The buggy function expects `self.columns` to be a list, but it is actually `None`. This discrepancy results in the `TypeError`.
4. To fix the bug, we need to check if `self.columns` is not `None` before trying to get its length. If `self.columns` is `None`, we can set `colnames` to an empty string directly.
5. To fix the bug, we will modify the buggy function to include a check for `None` before getting the length of `self.columns`.

### Corrected Version
```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    
    if self.columns is not None:  # Check if self.columns is not None
        if len(self.columns) > 0:
            colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
            colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
``` 

By adding a check for `None` on `self.columns`, we ensure that the `len()` function is only called when `self.columns` is a list, preventing the `TypeError` from occurring.
