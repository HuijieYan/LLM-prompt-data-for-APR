### Analysis
1. The buggy function `copy` is trying to check the length of `self.columns`, but in the failing test scenario, `self.columns` is `None`, leading to a `TypeError` when trying to call `len` on it.
2. The error message indicates that the object of type 'NoneType' has no length, which happens when trying to execute `len(None)`.
3. The validation of `self.columns` being `None` needs to be handled before trying to get its length to avoid the `TypeError`.
4. To fix this bug, we need to check if `self.columns` is `None` before trying to get its length and conditionally set `colnames` to be empty if `self.columns` is `None`.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug
1. Add a check for `self.columns` being `None` before trying to get its length.
2. If `self.columns` is not `None`, then proceed to get the column names as part of `colnames`.
3. If `self.columns` is `None`, set `colnames` to an empty string.

### Corrected Version
```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns is not None:  # Check if self.columns is not None
        if len(self.columns) > 0:
            colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
            colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)
    
    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options())
    )
```

By adding the `if self.columns is not None:` check before accessing the length of `self.columns`, we ensure that the `TypeError` is avoided when `self.columns` is `None`. This corrected version should now handle the case where `self.columns` is `None` properly and prevent the error from occurring.
