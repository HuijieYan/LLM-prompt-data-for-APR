### Analysis
1. The error occurs because the `self.columns` attribute is `None`, and the buggy function tries to call `len()` on a `NoneType` object.
2. The `self.columns` attribute should be checked for `None` before attempting to get its length.
3. The buggy function expects to build the `colnames` variable based on the `self.columns` attribute, but it's not handling the case where `self.columns` is `None`.
4. We should add a conditional check to handle the `self.columns` being `None` and ensure that `colnames` is an empty string in that case.

### Strategy
1. Check if `self.columns` is `None` before proceeding to get its length and construct `colnames`.
2. If `self.columns` is `None`, set `colnames` to an empty string.
3. Ensure that the corrected function handles both cases where `self.columns` is not `None` and where it is `None`.

### Corrected Version
```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns is not None:  # Check if self.columns is not None
        if len(self.columns) > 0:
            colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
            colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options())
    )
```

With this correction, the function now checks if `self.columns` is `None` before trying to get its length and construct `colnames`. If `self.columns` is `None`, `colnames` is set to an empty string. This modification ensures that the function can handle the case where `self.columns` is `None`.
