### Analysis
1. The error occurs when trying to check the length of `self.columns`, which is `None` in the failing test case.
2. The `self.columns` attribute is set to `None` in the failing test case, leading to a `TypeError` when checking its length.
3. The `columns` attribute should be properly initialized to an empty list to avoid the `NoneType` error when checking its length.
4. By initializing `self.columns` to an empty list, we can prevent the `TypeError` and ensure the function works correctly.

### Corrected Version

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns is None:  # Check if self.columns is set to None
        self.columns = []  # Initialize to an empty list if None
    if len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

By checking if `self.columns` is `None` and initializing it to an empty list if needed, we prevent the `TypeError` from occurring. This corrected version should now handle cases where `self.columns` is not set correctly and ensure the function executes without errors.
