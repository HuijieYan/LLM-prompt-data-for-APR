### Analysis
1. The buggy function `copy` is failing with a `TypeError` because it's trying to check the length of `self.columns`, which is `None`. This error occurs when trying to compare `None` with an integer value in `if len(self.columns) > 0`.
2. The `columns` attribute is expected to be a list of column names, but it is set to `None` in one of the test cases, leading to the error.
3. The error message indicates that `object of type 'NoneType' has no len()`, which clearly points to comparing the length of a `NoneType` object.
4. To fix the bug, we need to handle the case where `self.columns` is `None` and set `colnames` accordingly.
5. In the corrected version of the function, we will handle the case where the `columns` attribute is `None` by setting `colnames` to an empty string in that scenario.

### Corrected Version
```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns is not None:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options())
    )
```

Now, when `self.columns` is `None`, `colnames` will be set to an empty string, avoiding the `TypeError` that was occurring before. This corrected version should pass the failing test with the expected input/output values.
