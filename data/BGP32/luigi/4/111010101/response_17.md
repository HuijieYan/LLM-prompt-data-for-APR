## Analysis
1. The error message indicates a `TypeError` due to `NoneType` object having no length. This error is occurring in the `copy` function of the `S3CopyToTable` class when trying to check the length of `self.columns`, which is `None`.
2. The buggy function is trying to construct a query for copying data from S3 to Redshift. It constructs a string named `colnames` based on the columns provided. However, when `self.columns` is `None`, it leads to an error when trying to check its length.
3. The cause of the bug is that the buggy function doesn't handle the case when `self.columns` is `None`. It assumes that `self.columns` will always have a value, causing the error when trying to access its length.
4. To fix the bug, we need to check if `self.columns` is `None` before attempting to access its length. If it is `None`, we can set `colnames` to an empty string.
5. The corrected version of the function is provided below.

## Corrected Version
```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns is not None:  # Check if self.columns is not None
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options())
    )
```

In the corrected version, we first check if `self.columns` is not `None` before proceeding to construct the `colnames` string. This change ensures that the function can handle the case when `self.columns` is `None`, preventing the `TypeError` that was occurring.
