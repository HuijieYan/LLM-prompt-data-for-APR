### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `copy` is throwing a `TypeError: object of type 'NoneType' has no len()` due to the comparison `if len(self.columns) > 0:` where `self.columns` is of type `None`.
2. The expected input values are `f` as a string, `self` as an instance of `DummyS3CopyToTableKey`, and `cursor` as a MagicMock object.
3. The buggy function is attempting to access the length of `self.columns`, which is `None`, causing the TypeError.
4. To fix this bug, we need to check if `self.columns` is not `None` before trying to get its length. If it's `None`, we can set `colnames` to an empty string.
5. By adding a simple check for `self.columns is not None`, we can prevent the TypeError from occurring.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    
    if self.columns is not None and len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
