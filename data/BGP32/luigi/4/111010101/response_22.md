### Analysis
1. The error occurs because the function is trying to check the length of `self.columns`, which is a `NoneType` object.
2. The `self.columns` attribute is supposed to be a list of columns, but in this case, it is `None`.
3. The error message `TypeError: object of type 'NoneType' has no len()` indicates that `self.columns` is `None`.
4. To fix the bug, we need to handle the case where `self.columns` is `None` before trying to access its length.

### Bug Fix
```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:  # Fixed the bug here
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
``` 

By adding the condition `if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0`, we first check if `self.columns` is not `None` before trying to access its length. This fix will prevent the `TypeError` that occurs when `self.columns` is `None`.
