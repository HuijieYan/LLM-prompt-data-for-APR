### Analysis
The error message indicates a `TypeError` related to trying to get the length of a `NoneType` object. The buggy function is trying to check the length of `self.columns`, but since it is `None`, it results in a `TypeError`. The buggy function is missing a condition to handle the case when `self.columns` is `None`.

### Fixing the Bug
To fix the bug, we need to add a condition to check if `self.columns` is `None` before trying to get its length. If `self.columns` is `None`, we can set `colnames` to an empty string.

### Corrected Version
```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    
    if self.columns is not None:  # Check if self.columns is not None
        if len(self.columns) > 0:
            colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
            colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)
    
    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options())
    )
```

With this correction, the function will now handle the case when `self.columns` is `None` and set `colnames` to an empty string in that scenario.
