### Analysis
The bug in the provided function is in the construction of the SQL query string for the `cursor.execute` method. The `copy_options` method is not being called correctly as a method, resulting in a potential error. Additionally, the `colnames` variable is being assigned but not used in the SQL query string.

### Bug Explanation
The bug is caused by not calling the `copy_options` method correctly and by not including the `colnames` variable in the SQL query string. Due to this, the `options` parameter in the SQL query is a reference to the `self.copy_options` method rather than its result.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to call the `copy_options` method correctly to obtain the actual options string and include the `colnames` variable in the SQL query string.

### Corrected Version
```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: luigi/contrib/redshift.py

class S3CopyToTable(rdbms.CopyToTable, _CredentialsMixin):
   
    def copy_options(self):
        # Implement this method to define the options string
        pass
        
    def copy(self, cursor, f):
        """
        Defines copying from s3 into redshift.
        
        If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
        """
        logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
        colnames = ''
        if len(self.columns) > 0:
            colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
            colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)
    
        cursor.execute("""
         COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
         CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
         {options}
         ;""".format(
            table=self.table,
            colnames=colnames,
            source=f,
            creds=self._credentials(),
            options=self.copy_options())
        )
```

In the corrected version of the function, `self.copy_options()` is called to obtain the actual options string, and the `colnames` variable is included in the SQL query string. This should address the bug and ensure the function works correctly with the expected input/output values.
