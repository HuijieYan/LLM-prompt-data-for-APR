### Analysis
The buggy function `copy` is trying to execute a SQL `COPY` command to copy data from S3 into Redshift. The bug seems to be in the way the `self.copy_options` is being passed to the SQL query. Currently, it is being passed as a function instead of a function call, which will cause issues during execution.

### Bug Cause
The bug is caused by passing the `self.copy_options` function itself instead of calling it to get the actual options string. This will result in an incorrect SQL query being executed due to the function reference.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the `self.copy_options` function is correctly called to get the string of options before passing it to the SQL query.

### Corrected Version
```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options())
    )
```

In the corrected version, `self.copy_options` is changed to `self.copy_options()` to call the function and retrieve the options string correctly. This will ensure that the SQL query is constructed and executed properly.
