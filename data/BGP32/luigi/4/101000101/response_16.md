The bug in the `copy` function lies in the way `self.copy_options` is being called as a method instead of a property. This results in incorrect formatting of the query that is executed by `cursor.execute`.

To fix this bug:
1. Change `self.copy_options` to `self.copy_options()` to correctly call the method and retrieve the options string that should be included in the COPY query.

Here is the corrected version of the `copy` function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options()
    )
)
```

This corrected version ensures that the `self.copy_options` method is called correctly to fetch the options string for the COPY query.
