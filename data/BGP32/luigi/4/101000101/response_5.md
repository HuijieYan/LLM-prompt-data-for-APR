### Analysis
The buggy function `copy` is failing due to a syntax error in the `cursor.execute` call. The `copy_options` function is not being called properly within the `cursor.execute` statement, causing the error.

### Bug Cause
The bug is caused by not calling the `copy_options` function correctly within the `cursor.execute` statement. The `copy_options` function is a method of the class `S3CopyToTable`, but it is being used as a property, resulting in a syntax error.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug
To fix the bug, we need to call the `copy_options` function properly within the `cursor.execute` statement. We should use `self.copy_options()` instead of `self.copy_options`.

### Corrected Version
```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options())
    )
``` 

### Updated explanation:
In the corrected version of the buggy function `copy`, `self.copy_options()` is used instead of `self.copy_options` to properly call the `copy_options` function within the `cursor.execute` statement. This will ensure that the `copy_options` method is executed correctly, fixing the syntax error.
