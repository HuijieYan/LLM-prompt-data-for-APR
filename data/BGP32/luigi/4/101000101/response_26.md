### Analysis
The buggy function `copy` in the `S3CopyToTable` class is attempting to execute a SQL `COPY` command, but it has a bug in the `cursor.execute` statement. The `self.copy_options` is not being properly called as a function in the string formatting, which will result in a TypeError.

### Bug Explanation
The bug is in the line:
```python
options=self.copy_options)
```
Here, `self.copy_options` is a method, but it should be called as a method to get the correct value. As it is, it's being passed as a reference to the function itself, causing the TypeError.

### Bug Fix
To fix this bug, we need to call the `copy_options` method to get its return value before passing it to the SQL query string.

### Corrected Version
```python
# The declaration of the class containing the corrected function
class S3CopyToTable(rdbms.CopyToTable, _CredentialsMixin):
    def copy_options(self):
        # Please ignore the body of this function

    def copy(self, cursor, f):
        """
        Defines copying from s3 into redshift.
    
        If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
        """
        logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
        colnames = ''
        if len(self.columns) > 0:
            colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
            colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)
    
        # Call the copy_options method to get the correct value
        options = self.copy_options()

        cursor.execute("""
         COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
         CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
         {options}
         ;""".format(
            table=self.table,
            colnames=colnames,
            source=f,
            creds=self._credentials(),
            options=options)
        )
```

This corrected version of the `copy` function will call the `copy_options` method to retrieve the correct value before passing it to the SQL query string, fixing the bug.
