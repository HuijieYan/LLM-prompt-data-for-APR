The bug in the provided function lies in the way the `copy_options` method is being called within the `cursor.execute` statement. The `copy_options` method should be called as a function `self.copy_options()` instead of just referring to it as an attribute `self.copy_options`.

To fix the bug, we need to update the `cursor.execute` statement to correctly call the `copy_options` method. 

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: luigi/contrib/redshift.py

# The corrected buggy function
class S3CopyToTable(rdbms.CopyToTable, _CredentialsMixin):
    def copy_options(self):
        # Please ignore the body of this function

    def copy(self, cursor, f):
        """
        Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

        If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
        """
        logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
        colnames = ''
        if len(self.columns) > 0:
            colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
            colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

        cursor.execute("""
         COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
             CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
             {options}
             ;""".format(
            table=self.table,
            colnames=colnames,
            source=f,
            creds=self._credentials(),
            options=self.copy_options())  # Corrected call to copy_options method
        )
```

This corrected version will now correctly call the `copy_options` method within the `cursor.execute` statement, resolving the bug in the original function.
