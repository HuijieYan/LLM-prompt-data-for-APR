### Identifying the bug
The bug in the provided function lies in the way the `copy_options` function is called within the `cursor.execute` statement. The function `copy_options` is not being called correctly, resulting in a potential error as it is not providing the necessary options for the `COPY` command.

### Cause of the bug
The bug is caused by incorrectly referencing the `copy_options` function within the `cursor.execute` statement. The function `copy_options` should be called as a method `self.copy_options()` but it is being referenced without the parentheses which prevents the function from being executed. This results in the `options` variable being assigned the function object itself instead of the return value of the function.

### Strategy for fixing the bug
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the `copy_options` function is correctly called and its return value is used for the `options` variable within the `cursor.execute` statement.

### Corrected version of the function
```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options())
    )
```

By making this change and calling `self.copy_options()` with parentheses, we ensure that the `copy_options` function is correctly executed and its return value is used in the `cursor.execute` statement. This should address the bug and produce the expected results for the function.
