The buggy function has an issue in the `cursor.execute()` statement. The `self.copy_options` should be called as a function since it is a method (`self.copy_options()`), but it is being called as an attribute (`self.copy_options`). This results in passing the function reference instead of calling the function itself.

To fix the bug, we need to call the `self.copy_options()` method in the `cursor.execute()` statement.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
# The corrected version of the buggy function
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options())
    )
```

This correction ensures that the `self.copy_options` method is properly called in the `cursor.execute()` statement.
