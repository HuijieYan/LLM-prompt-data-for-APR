### Analysis
The buggy function `copy` is expected to construct a SQL query to copy data from an S3 file into a Redshift table. It needs to correctly format the `COPY` command with table name, column names, source file, credentials, and options.

The bug in the function lies in how `copy_options` function is called. Instead of calling the function, it mistakenly refers to the function object itself. This results in a syntax error when constructing the SQL query.

### Bug
The bug in the function is caused by calling `self.copy_options` without the parentheses to actually execute the function. This results in `options=self.copy_options` being set to the function object instead of the expected return value of the function.

### Fix
To fix the bug, we need to call the `copy_options` function within the `COPY` command construction. This can be done by adding parentheses to `self.copy_options()`.

### Corrected Version
```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options())
    )
```
