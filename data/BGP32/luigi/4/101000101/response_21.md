### Analysis
The buggy function `copy` is responsible for copying data from an S3 location into a Redshift table. The bug seems to be in the `cursor.execute` call, where `copy_options` function should be called to provide additional copy options. However, the function `copy_options` is not being called correctly. 

### Bug Explanation
The bug occurs because `copy_options` is not being called as a function but is being referenced as a property. This results in the `options` being assigned the function object itself rather than the return value of the `copy_options` function.

### Bug Fix
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that `copy_options` is called as a function by adding parentheses `()` after `self.copy_options` in the `cursor.execute` call.

### Corrected Version
```python
    def copy(self, cursor, f):
        """
        Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

        If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
        """
        logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
        colnames = ''
        if len(self.columns) > 0:
            colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
            colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

        cursor.execute("""
         COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
         CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
         {options}
         ;""".format(
            table=self.table,
            colnames=colnames,
            source=f,
            creds=self._credentials(),
            options=self.copy_options())  # Call copy_options as a function
        )
``` 

This corrected version should now correctly call the `copy_options` function and include the return value in the SQL query for copying data into the Redshift table.
