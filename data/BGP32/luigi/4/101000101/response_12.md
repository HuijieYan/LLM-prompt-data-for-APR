### Analysis
The bug in the provided function is due to missing parentheses `()` in the `self.copy_options` call within the `cursor.execute()` method. This is causing the `copy_options` method to not be called properly, leading to incorrect SQL execution.

### Bug Cause
In the buggy function, the `self.copy_options` is missing parentheses `()` at the end, which leads to not actually calling the `copy_options` method. As a result, the SQL query is not properly constructed.

### Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the `self.copy_options()` method is properly called with parentheses `()`. This will ensure that the `copy_options` method is executed and its return value is used in constructing the SQL query.

### Corrected Version
```python
# The declaration of the class containing the corrected function
class S3CopyToTable(rdbms.CopyToTable, _CredentialsMixin):
    # This function from the same class is called by the buggy function
    def copy_options(self):
        # Please ignore the body of this function

    # The corrected buggy function
    def copy(self, cursor, f):
        """
        Defines copying from s3 into redshift.
    
        If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
        """
        logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
        colnames = ''
        if len(self.columns) > 0:
            colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
            colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)
    
        cursor.execute("""
         COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
         CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
         {options}
         ;""".format(
            table=self.table,
            colnames=colnames,
            source=f,
            creds=self._credentials(),
            options=self.copy_options())  # Fixed the missing parentheses here
        )
```

After applying the fix above, the `copy_options` method will be properly called in the SQL query, resolving the bug.
