### Analysis
- The buggy function `copy` is trying to execute a SQL `COPY` command to copy data from an S3 source into a Redshift table.
- The function constructs the SQL command using string formatting with placeholders for table name, column names, source file, credentials, and options.
- The bug seems to be in how the `copy_options` method is being called within the string formatting. It should be a method call `self.copy_options()` instead of just `self.copy_options`.

### Bug Cause
The bug in the function is that `self.copy_options` is being used directly in the string formatting without calling it as a method (`self.copy_options()`). This causes the `copy_options` function to not be executed and the string representation of the function object to be used instead.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug
To fix the bug, make sure to call the `self.copy_options()` method in the string formatting where `options` is being constructed.

### Corrected Version
```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options())
    )
```
