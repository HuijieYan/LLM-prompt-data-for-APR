### Identifying the bug

1. The `self.copy_options` in the `cursor.execute` statement is missing `()` at the end, which means the `copy_options` function is not being called.
2. The `copy_options` function should return a string that represents the copy options, but it is not being invoked correctly.
3. The `creds` being passed as a string might not be the expected credentials format for the `CREDENTIALS` clause in the `COPY` command.

### Strategy for fixing the bug

1. Call the `copy_options` function correctly to get the copy options string.
2. Make sure the `creds` variable holds the correct credentials string format for the `CREDENTIALS` clause.
3. Ensure that the concatenation of the SQL query is done correctly.

### Corrected version of the function

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options()  # Call the copy_options function
    ))
```

By adding `()` to `self.copy_options`, we will correctly call the `copy_options` function to get the copy options string.
