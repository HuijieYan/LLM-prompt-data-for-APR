The bug in the provided function is in the formatting of the SQL query string in the `cursor.execute()` call. The `copy_options` variable is not being called as a function in the query string, causing an issue when executing the SQL query.

To fix this bug, we need to call the `copy_options` function in the string formatting before passing it to the `cursor.execute()` function.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options())
    )
```

With this correction, the `copy_options` function is properly called and evaluated within the SQL query string before executing the `cursor.execute()` function. This fix should address the bug and ensure the function works as expected for the provided input and output values.
