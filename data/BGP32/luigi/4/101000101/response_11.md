### Analysis
The buggy function `copy` is using the `cursor.execute()` method to execute a SQL query to copy data from S3 to Redshift. The bug seems to be related to how the `copy_options` function is being passed as a parameter to the `cursor.execute()` method.

### Bug Explanation
The bug in the `copy` function is in the line:
```python
options=self.copy_options
```
In this line, `self.copy_options` is being passed as a parameter to the `cursor.execute()` method without actually calling the `copy_options` function to get its return value. This results in passing the function object itself, rather than the return value of the function.

### Bug Fix
To fix this bug, we need to make sure to call the `self.copy_options()` function to get its return value before passing it as a parameter to `cursor.execute()`.

### Corrected Version
```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options())
    )
```

By making this change, we are now calling the `self.copy_options()` function to get its return value and passing that value to the `cursor.execute()` method as expected. This corrected version should now properly execute the copy operation from S3 to Redshift.
