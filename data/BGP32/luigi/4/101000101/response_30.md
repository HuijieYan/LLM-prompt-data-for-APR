### Analysis
The buggy function `copy` in the `S3CopyToTable` class is intended to copy data from S3 to a Redshift table. The bug seems to be in the way the `copy_options` function is being called. It should be a method call `self.copy_options()` instead of just `self.copy_options`. This is causing a `TypeError` as the code is trying to concatenate a string with a function object.

### Strategy for fixing the bug
The bug can be fixed by calling the `copy_options` method correctly with `self.copy_options()`.

### Corrected Version
```python
# The corrected version of the buggy function
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options())
    )
```
