The bug in the provided function is in the way the `self.copy_options` is being called. It is missing parentheses at the end which means it is not being called as a function, leading to incorrect SQL query formation.

To fix this bug, we need to ensure that `self.copy_options` is properly called as a function before concatenating it into the SQL query.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options())
    )
```

By adding the parentheses `()` after `self.copy_options`, we ensure that the function is properly called and the SQL query is formed correctly. This should fix the bug and satisfy all the expected input/output values specified in the test cases.
