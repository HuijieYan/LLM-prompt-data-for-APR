The bug in the provided function lies in the line where "self.copy_options" is being passed as a variable without calling it as a function. The correct usage should be "self.copy_options()", as it is a method that needs to be executed to get the actual options for copying.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the line:
```python
options=self.copy_options)
```

to:
```python
options=self.copy_options())
```

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options())
    )
```

This corrected version should now properly execute the copy_options method to retrieve the required options for the copy operation.
