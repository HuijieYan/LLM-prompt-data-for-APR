### 3. Explanation of the bug

The bug in the provided buggy function is due to the incorrect usage of `self.copy_options`. In the string formatting for the `cursor.execute` statement, `self.copy_options` is intended to be a function call (`self.copy_options()`), but it is mistakenly used as an attribute (`self.copy_options`). This results in an error when trying to execute the SQL query because `self.copy_options` is a function and not a string that can be directly inserted into the query.

### 4. Strategy for fixing the bug

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that `self.copy_options` is called as a function `self.copy_options()` before inserting it into the SQL query.

### Corrected version of the function

```python
# Fixing the bug in the copy function by calling self.copy_options as a function
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options())
    )
```

In the corrected version, `self.copy_options()` is called as a function before being inserted into the `cursor.execute` statement. This ensures that the function is executed and its result (presumably a string) is included in the SQL query correctly.
