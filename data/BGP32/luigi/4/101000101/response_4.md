### Analysis
The buggy function `copy` is attempting to execute a SQL query using the `cursor.execute()` method. However, there are a few issues in the function:
1. The `self.copy_options` variable is being used incorrectly as a function without calling it.
2. The `source` variable is not correctly formatted in the SQL query.

### Bug
The bug in the `copy` function lies in the incorrect usage of `self.copy_options` as a function call without parentheses, and the incorrect formatting of the `source` variable in the SQL query.

### Fix
To fix the bug, we need to correctly call the `self.copy_options` function and properly format the `source` variable within the SQL query.

### Corrected Version
```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options())
    )
```

### This corrected version should now correctly call the `self.copy_options()` function and properly format the `source` variable within the SQL query.
