### Analysis
The buggy function `copy` is intended to execute a `COPY` command from an S3 source into a Redshift table. However, there are several issues identified:
1. `colnames` is being incorrectly formatted with parentheses in the `cursor.execute` call.
2. The `options` parameter in the `cursor.execute` call is mistakenly referencing the `copy_options` method without actually calling it.
3. The `self._credentials()` method is being called to retrieve the credentials, but it's not clear what this method should return.


### Bug Fixing Strategy
1. Fix the formatting of `colnames` when included in the `COPY` command.
2. Call the `copy_options` method to retrieve the options string.
3. Ensure that the `self._credentials()` method correctly provides the necessary credentials.

### Corrected Version
```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
    
    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames}
     FROM '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options())
    )
```

This corrected version fixes the formatting of `colnames` and correctly calls the `copy_options` method to retrieve the options string. Make sure that the `self._credentials()` method returns the necessary credentials for the `COPY` command to succeed.
