### Analysis
The buggy function `copy` is responsible for copying data from an S3 location into a Redshift table. The function is constructing a SQL query using string formatting to insert the data. The bug appears to be in the construction of the SQL query itself, specifically in how `colnames` and `copy_options` are being included.

### Bug Explanation
1. The `colnames` variable is being constructed correctly by joining the column names if they exist in `self.columns`. However, it is enclosed in parenthesis within `colnames`, which can cause issues when included in the SQL query.
2. The `copy_options` variable is intended to be a string but in the buggy code, it is being set as a function `self.copy_options`. This could lead to a TypeError when the function is called in the SQL query.

### Fix Strategy
1. Remove the parenthesis from the `colnames` variable to ensure it is inserted correctly in the SQL query.
2. Call the `self.copy_options()` function to get the actual options string and assign it to the `copy_options` variable.

### Corrected Version
```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from S3 into Redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
    
    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options())
    )
```

By making these changes, the corrected function should now properly construct the SQL query with the correct `colnames` and `copy_options` values.
