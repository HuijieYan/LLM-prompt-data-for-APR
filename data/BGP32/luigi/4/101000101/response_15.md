The bug in the provided function `copy` is that `self.copy_options` is not being called as a function. Instead, it should be `self.copy_options()` to correctly execute the function and retrieve its returned value.

The correct strategy to fix this bug is to call `self.copy_options()` to properly get the value returned by the function.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: luigi/contrib/redshift.py

# The declaration of the class containing the corrected function
class S3CopyToTable(rdbms.CopyToTable, _CredentialsMixin):
    # This function from the same class is called by the corrected function
    def copy_options(self):
        # Please ignore the body of this function

    # The corrected function
    def copy(self, cursor, f):
        """
        Defines copying from s3 into redshift.
    
        If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
        """
        logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
        colnames = ''
        if len(self.columns) > 0:
            colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
            colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)
    
        cursor.execute("""
         COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
         CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
         {options}
         ;""".format(
            table=self.table,
            colnames=colnames,
            source=f,
            creds=self._credentials(),
            options=self.copy_options()) # Corrected call to self.copy_options()
        )
```

This corrected version of the function calls `self.copy_options()` to correctly retrieve the value returned by the function, fixing the bug.
