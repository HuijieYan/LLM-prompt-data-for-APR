The bug in this function lies in the line where `self.copy_options` is being passed as a parameter without actually calling the `copy_options` method. This results in the `options` placeholder in the SQL query being assigned the memory reference of the method instead of the result of the method call.

To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the `copy_options` method is called and its result is concatenated into the SQL query.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options())
    )
```

In this corrected version, `self.copy_options()` is called to obtain the actual options string from the method, which fixes the bug in the original implementation. This corrected version should now satisfy the expected input/output values provided.
