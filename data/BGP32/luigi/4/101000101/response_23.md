### Analysis
The buggy function `copy` is trying to execute a Redshift `COPY` command to copy data from an S3 source into a Redshift table. There are a few potential issues in the function:
1. The `copy_options` function is being passed incorrectly in the SQL query string. It should be called as a function since it returns options for the `COPY` command.
2. The `colnames` variable is not correctly formed and inserted into the SQL query string.
3. The `creds` value is not being passed correctly in the SQL query string.

### Bug Cause
The bug causes the `copy` function to fail because of passing the `copy_options` function incorrectly and not correctly formatting the `colnames` variable.

### Bug Fix
To fix the bug, we need to call the `copy_options` function where it's used in the SQL string, correctly format the `colnames` variable, and pass the `creds` value in the SQL string as a literal string.

### Corrected Version
```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS 'aws_iam_role={creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options())
    )
```

In the corrected version:
1. We are calling `self.copy_options()` to correctly utilize the return value of the `copy_options` function.
2. We are formatting the `colnames` variable correctly and inserting it into the SQL query string.
3. We are passing the `creds` value correctly as `'aws_iam_role={creds}'` in the SQL query string.
