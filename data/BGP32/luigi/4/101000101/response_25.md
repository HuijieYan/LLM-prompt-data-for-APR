The bug in the provided function is in the way the `copy_options` function is being called. Instead of calling the function `self.copy_options()`, it is being referenced directly as `self.copy_options`. This leads to `options=self.copy_options` referencing the function object itself rather than its execution result.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that we actually call the `copy_options` function and use its result in the SQL query.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
# The relative path of the corrected file containing the fixed function: luigi/contrib/redshift.py

# Consider importing the required modules if not already imported

class S3CopyToTable(rdbms.CopyToTable, _CredentialsMixin):
    def copy_options(self):
        # Please ignore the body of this function

    def copy(self, cursor, f):
        """
        Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

        If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
        """
        logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
        colnames = ''
        if len(self.columns) > 0:
            colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
            colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

        options = self.copy_options()  # Call the function to get the options
        cursor.execute("""
         COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
         CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
         {options}
         ;""".format(
            table=self.table,
            colnames=colnames,
            source=f,
            creds=self._credentials(),
            options=options)  # Use the result of copy_options function
        )
```

By making this change, the `copy_options` function will be properly executed, and its result will be used in the SQL query, fixing the bug.
