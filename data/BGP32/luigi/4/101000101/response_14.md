The bug in the provided function is in the way the `self.copy_options` function is being used within the `cursor.execute` statement. The `self.copy_options` function is not being called correctly.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that `self.copy_options()` is called as a function, not just referenced as an attribute.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: luigi/contrib/redshift.py

class S3CopyToTable(rdbms.CopyToTable, _CredentialsMixin):
    def copy_options(self):
        # Please ignore the body of this function

    def copy(self, cursor, f):
        """
        Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

        If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
        """
        logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
        colnames = ''
        if len(self.columns) > 0:
            colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
            colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

        cursor.execute("""
         COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
         CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
         {options}
         ;""".format(
            table=self.table,
            colnames=colnames,
            source=f,
            creds=self._credentials(),
            options=self.copy_options())
        )
```

This correction ensures that the `copy_options` function is correctly called with `self.copy_options()`, which should fix the bug.
