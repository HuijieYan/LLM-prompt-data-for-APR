## Analysis
The buggy function `copy` is supposed to perform a `COPY` operation from S3 into Redshift. However, there are several issues in the implementation:
1. The `copy_options` method is not being called properly. It should be invoked as a method `self.copy_options()` instead of `self.copy_options`.
2. The `options` variable in the `cursor.execute` statement is not being assigned the result of `self.copy_options()`.

## Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug:
1. Correctly call the `copy_options` method by adding parentheses.
2. Assign the result of `self.copy_options()` to the `options` variable in the `cursor.execute` statement.

## Corrected Version
```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options())
    )
```

This corrected version of the function should now properly call the `copy_options` method and assign its result to the `options` variable in the `cursor.execute` statement.
