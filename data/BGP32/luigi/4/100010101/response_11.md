### Bug Analysis
The buggy function `copy()` is trying to check the length of `self.columns` to determine whether any columns are provided. However, the bug occurs because `self.columns` is `None` instead of an empty list. This results in a `TypeError: object of type 'NoneType' has no len()` when the function tries to call `len()` on a `NoneType`.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix this bug, we need to handle the case where `self.columns` is `None` separately to avoid the `TypeError`. We can modify the function to check if `self.columns` is `None` before getting its length.

### Corrected Function
```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    
    if self.columns is not None and len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

With this modification, the function will first check if `self.columns` is not `None` before trying to get its length. This will prevent the `TypeError` from occurring.
