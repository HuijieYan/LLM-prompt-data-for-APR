### Analysis
- The error message indicates a `TypeError: object of type 'NoneType' has no len()`.
- The buggy function is checking the length of `self.columns`, which can be `None`.
- The function assumes that `self.columns` will always have a value, leading to the TypeError.
- To fix this, we need to handle the case where `self.columns` is `None` before checking its length.

### Fixing the Bug
To fix the bug, we can add a check to see if `self.columns` is `None` before attempting to get its length. If it is `None`, we set `colnames` to an empty string. This way, the function won't throw a TypeError when `self.columns` is `None`.

### Corrected Version
```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
``` 

By adding the `if self.columns` check, we ensure that `colnames` is only constructed if `self.columns` has a value. This correction should prevent the TypeError from occurring and allow the function to execute successfully.
