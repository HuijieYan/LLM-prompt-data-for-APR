### Bug Analysis
- The error message indicates a `TypeError: object of type 'NoneType' has no len()`.
- The buggy function is trying to check the length of `self.columns`, which is `None` in this case.
- The function is not handling the case where `self.columns` is `None`, leading to the `TypeError`.
- The function should handle the case where `self.columns` is `None` to avoid the `TypeError`.

### Bug Fix Strategy
- Check if `self.columns` is not `None` before trying to get its length.
- If `self.columns` is not `None`, proceed with constructing the `colnames` string.
- If `self.columns` is `None`, set `colnames` to an empty string.

### Corrected Version
```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns is not None:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

By adding the check `if self.columns is not None:` before operating on `self.columns`, we ensure that the code handles the `None` case properly and doesn't lead to a `TypeError`. This corrected version should pass the failing test.
