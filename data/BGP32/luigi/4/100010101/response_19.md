### Analysis
The error message indicates a `TypeError: object of type 'NoneType' has no len()` which suggests that the `self.columns` attribute is `None` and not a list as expected. The buggy function does not handle the case where `self.columns` is `None`, leading to the error.

### Bug Cause
The bug is caused by not checking if `self.columns` is `None` before trying to get its length. When `self.columns` is `None`, the attempt to use `len(self.columns)` results in a `TypeError`.

### Bug Fix
To fix this bug, we need to check if `self.columns` is `None` before trying to access its length. If it is `None`, we can set `colnames` to an empty string directly.

### Corrected Version
```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns is not None:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
``` 

By adding the check `if self.columns is not None`, we avoid the `TypeError` when `self.columns` is `None`. This corrected version should pass the failing test and handle the case where `self.columns` is `None`.
