### Bug Analysis
The error message "TypeError: object of type 'NoneType' has no len()" indicates that the code is trying to get the length of a `NoneType` object, which is not allowed. This is likely happening because the `self.columns` attribute is `None` and the code is attempting to check its length in the `if` statement.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix this bug, we need to handle the case where `self.columns` is `None` before checking its length. We can do this by adding a condition to check if `self.columns` is not `None` before attempting to get its length.

### Corrected Version
```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns is not None and len(self.columns) > 0:  # Checking if self.columns is not None before checking its length
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

The corrected version adds a condition `if self.columns is not None and len(self.columns) > 0:` before trying to get the length of `self.columns`. This ensures that the code will only attempt to get the length if `self.columns` is not `None`, preventing the `TypeError` from occurring.
