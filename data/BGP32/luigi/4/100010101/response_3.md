### Analysis
- The error message indicates a `TypeError` due to trying to get the length of a `NoneType` object.
- The `columns` attribute of `self` is set to `None` when creating an instance of `DummyS3CopyToTableKey`.
- The buggy code attempts to check the length of `self.columns` without verifying if it is `None`.

### Bug Cause
The bug is caused by not handling the case where `self.columns` is `None`, leading to a `TypeError` when trying to get the length of `None`.

### Bug Fix
Add a check to verify if `self.columns` is not `None` before attempting to get its length.

### The corrected version of the function
```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns is not None and len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
``` 

This corrected version includes a check if `self.columns` is not `None` before attempting to get its length.
