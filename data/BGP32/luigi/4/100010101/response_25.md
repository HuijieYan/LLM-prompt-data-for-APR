### Analysis
The error is due to the comparison `if len(self.columns) > 0:` where `self.columns` is expected to be a list but is actually `None`, resulting in a `TypeError`.

### Bug Cause
The bug occurs because the code does not handle the case when `self.columns` is `None`. The program tries to call `len()` on a `NoneType` object.

### Fix Strategy
We need to add a check to handle the case when `self.columns` is `None`. We can modify the condition to check if `self.columns` exists and if it is not `None` before attempting to get its length.

### Corrected Version
```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
``` 

By adding the check `if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:`, we ensure that the code does not attempt to get the length of `self.columns` when it is `None`, thus fixing the bug.
