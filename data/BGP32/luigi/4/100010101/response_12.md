The bug in the provided function is due to accessing the length of a `NoneType` object in the line `if len(self.columns) > 0:`. The `self.columns` is `None`, and trying to access its length directly causes a `TypeError`.

To fix this bug, we can first check if `self.columns` is not `None` before trying to access its length.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns is not None and len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

This corrected version checks if `self.columns` is not `None` before accessing its length, preventing the `TypeError` that was occurring before.
