### Bug Analysis
The bug in the provided function occurs because the `columns` parameter of the `DummyS3CopyToTableKey` class is set to `None`, causing an error when trying to check the length of `self.columns` in the `copy` function. The error message `TypeError: object of type 'NoneType' has no len()` indicates that an operation that requires a length check is being performed on a None type object.

### Bug Fixing Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to handle the case where `self.columns` is `None` and avoid performing any operations that require getting the length of the `columns` attribute.

### Corrected Function
```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns is not None and len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

### Expected Corrected Output
The corrected function should now handle the case where `self.columns` is `None` properly and avoid the TypeError.
