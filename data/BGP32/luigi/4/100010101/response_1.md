## Bug Analysis
The error message indicates a `TypeError` caused by trying to get the `len()` of a `NoneType` object, specifically when checking the length of `self.columns`.

The expected input for the `columns` parameter in `DummyS3CopyToTableKey` is `None`, as specified in the test case. However, the buggy function is not handling this scenario correctly, leading to the error.

## Bug Fix Strategy
To fix this bug, we need to handle the case when `self.columns` is `None` appropriately in the `copy` function. We can do this by checking if `self.columns` is not `None` before trying to access its length.

## Corrected Version

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns is not None and len(self.columns) > 0:  # Check if self.columns is not None before getting length
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

By adding the `self.columns is not None` check in the `if` condition, we ensure that the buggy function does not try to get the length of `None` when `self.columns` is `None`. This corrected version should now handle the `None` case appropriately and pass the failing test case.
