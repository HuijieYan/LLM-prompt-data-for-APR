The bug in the provided function is due to trying to perform a length check on a `NoneType` object, which is not allowed. The error message indicates a `TypeError: object of type 'NoneType' has no len()` at line 338, where the length of `self.columns` is being checked.

To fix this bug, we need to handle the case where `self.columns` is `None` before trying to access its length. We can do this by adding a check for `None` and setting `colnames` to an empty string in that case.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: luigi/contrib/redshift.py

# this is the corrected function
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:  # Check if self.columns is not None before checking length
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

With this correction, the function will now handle the case where `self.columns` is `None` without causing a `TypeError`, and the test case provided should pass successfully.
