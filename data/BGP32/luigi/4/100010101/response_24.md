### Analysis
The error message indicates that the `TypeError` is occurring at line 338 where `len(self.columns)` is being used. The issue is that `self.columns` is `None`, which doesn't have a length and therefore raises the error.

### Bug Cause
The bug is caused by checking the length of `self.columns` without first ensuring that it is not `None`. Since it is `None`, trying to get the length of `None` results in the `TypeError`.

### Fix Strategy
Before checking the length of `self.columns`, we need to add a condition to handle the case where `self.columns` is `None`. If `self.columns` is `None`, set `colnames` to an empty string to prevent the `TypeError`.

### Corrected Function
```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns is not None:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

By explicitly checking if `self.columns` is not `None` before attempting to get its length, we prevent the `TypeError` and ensure that `colnames` is correctly set to an empty string when `self.columns` is `None`.
