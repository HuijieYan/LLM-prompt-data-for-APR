### Analysis
The error occurs because the `self.columns` attribute is set to `None`, causing a `TypeError` when trying to get the length of a `NoneType` object. The function is not handling the case where `self.columns` is `None`.

### Solution
To fix this bug, we need to check if `self.columns` is not `None` before trying to access its length. If `self.columns` is `None`, we will set `colnames` to an empty string.

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns is not None and len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

By adding the check `if self.columns is not None`, we ensure that we only try to access the length of `self.columns` when it is not `None`. This change will prevent the `TypeError` from occurring when `self.columns` is `None`.
