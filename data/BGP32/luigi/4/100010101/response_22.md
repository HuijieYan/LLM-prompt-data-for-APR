### Analysis
The error message indicates a `TypeError` due to trying to get the length of a `NoneType` object (`self.columns`). This occurs when the `self.columns` attribute is `None`, and the code doesn't handle this case properly.

### Bug Cause
The buggy function assumes that `self.columns` will always be a list, but when it is `None`, the code fails when trying to get the length of `None`. This assumption leads to a `TypeError`.

### Bug Fix
To fix the bug, we need to handle the case when `self.columns` is `None` by checking if it is `None` before trying to get its length.

### Corrected Version
```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns is not None:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute(f"""
     COPY {self.table} {colnames} from '{f}'
     CREDENTIALS '{self._credentials()}'
     {self.copy_options}
     ;"""
    )
```

In this corrected version, we check if `self.columns` is not `None` before proceeding to create the `colnames` variable. This change avoids the `TypeError` when `self.columns` is `None`.
