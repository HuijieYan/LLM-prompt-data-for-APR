### Analysis
The function `_dict_arg` in the `SparkSubmitTask` class is extracting key-value pairs from a dictionary and formatting them for command-line arguments. The bug seems to be related to the formatting of the dictionary values. The failing tests indicate that there are discrepancies in how the values are being formatted compared to what is expected.

### Error Location
The error seems to occur in the way the dictionary values are being processed and formatted into command-line arguments. Specifically, it seems to be related to whether quotes are being added around the values.

### Cause of the Bug
The cause of the bug is likely due to the function attempting to wrap all dictionary values with double quotes, even if they are not strings. This results in an incorrect formatting of the arguments, leading to the assertion errors in the test cases.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug
To fix the bug, we should modify the function to check the type of the value before formatting it. If the value is a string, wrap it with double quotes; if it is not, handle it accordingly to avoid adding unnecessary quotes.

### Corrected Version
```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            if isinstance(val, str):
                command += [name, '{0}="{1}"'.format(prop, val)]
            else:
                command += [name, '{0}={1}'.format(prop, val)]
    return command
```

In the corrected version, we check if the value is a string before deciding whether to wrap it with double quotes. This change should address the formatting issue and allow the function to pass the failing tests.
