### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_dict_arg` in the `SparkSubmitTask` class has a bug that causes it to format the dictionary values incorrectly when creating a command for Spark job submission.
2. The function is supposed to iterate over the key-value pairs in the provided dictionary and format them as command-line arguments. However, it incorrectly uses double quotes around the values when creating the command, leading to a mismatch with the expected output in the test cases.
3. The error messages from the failing tests show that the difference occurs due to incorrect formatting of dictionary values resulting in extra double quotes in the command.
4. To fix the bug, the function `_dict_arg` needs to be modified to format the dictionary values without the additional double quotes.
5. The corrected version of the `_dict_arg` function is provided below.

### Corrected Version:
```python
import luigi

class SparkSubmitTask(luigi.Task):
    """
    Template task for running a Spark job
    
    Supports running jobs on Spark local, standalone, Mesos, or Yarn
    
    See http://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/submitting-applications.html
    for more information
    """
    
    def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
        command = []
        if value and isinstance(value, dict):
            for prop, val in value.items():
                command += [name, '{0}={1}'.format(prop, val)]
        return command
```

By removing the double quotes around the values in the command creation section, the corrected version of the `_dict_arg` function will now format the dictionary key-value pairs as expected, fixing the bug that caused the test cases to fail.
