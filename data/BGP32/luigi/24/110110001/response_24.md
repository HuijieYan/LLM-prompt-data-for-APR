### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_dict_arg` is part of the `SparkSubmitTask` class in `luigi/contrib/spark.py`.
2. The `test_run` and `test_defaults` test functions within the `spark_test.py` file are failing due to an incorrect list comparison.
3. The error message indicates that the lists in the test and the expected output are different because of the way the items are being compared.
4. The issue in the `_dict_arg` function is that it is incorrectly formatting the dictionary arguments.
5. To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the dictionary arguments are formatted correctly before being added to the command list.

### Strategy:
1. Modify the `_dict_arg` method to correctly format dictionary arguments.
2. Iterate over the dictionary items and format each key-value pair without any extra quotes or formatting issues.
3. Append the formatted key-value pair to the command list.
4. Update the tests to compare the lists without the extra quotes for dictionary values.

### Corrected Function:
```python
class SparkSubmitTask(luigi.Task):
    """
    Template task for running a Spark job
    
    Supports running jobs on Spark local, standalone, Mesos or Yarn
    
    See http://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/submitting-applications.html
    for more information
    """

    def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
        command = []
        if value and isinstance(value, dict):
            for prop, val in value.items():
                command += [name, '{0}={1}'.format(prop, val)]
        return command
```

By making the above changes to the `_dict_arg` function, the corrected version should now correctly format the dictionary arguments and pass both the failing tests.
