### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_dict_arg` within the `SparkSubmitTask` class takes in a `name` and `value` parameter as input and then constructs a command list based on the key-value pairs in the provided dictionary.
2. The failing tests are trying to verify that the correct command is being generated by calling the `_dict_arg` function with appropriate parameters.
3. The error messages from the failing tests show that there are discrepancies in the constructed command list, with extra quotes around certain values in the list. This indicates that the issue might be related to how the key-value pairs are being processed and added to the command list.
4. Based on the error messages, it seems like the bug is stemming from the usage of quotation marks around the values when constructing the command list. The quotes are being added mistakenly and causing the list comparison to fail.
5. To fix the bug, the quotation marks should be removed from around the values being added to the command list during iteration over the key-value pairs.

### Correction Strategy:
1. Check the logic inside the `_dict_arg` function and ensure that unnecessary quotes are being removed while constructing the command list.
2. Remove the quotes around the values to make the command list match the expected format.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, '{0}={1}'.format(prop, val)]
    return command
```

By updating the `_dict_arg` function as shown above, the issue with unnecessary quotes around the values in the command list should be resolved, and the corrected version should pass the failing tests.
