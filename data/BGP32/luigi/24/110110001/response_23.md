### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_dict_arg` in the `SparkSubmitTask` class is not correctly processing the dictionary argument passed to it.
2. The failing tests are checking if the arguments are processed correctly and passed to the `Popen` call.
3. In the first failing test, the dictionary key-value pair is being enclosed in quotes incorrectly.
4. In the second failing test, the dictionary key-value pair is being enclosed in incorrect single quotes.
5. The failing tests are asserting against the expected arguments which are not being processed correctly due to the bug in the `_dict_arg` function.

### Bug Cause:
The bug in the `_dict_arg` function is caused by incorrectly enclosing the dictionary key-value pairs in quotes, leading to mismatched expectations in the test assertions.

### Bug Fix:
To fix the bug, the quotes around the dictionary key-value pairs need to be removed and the correct format should be followed when constructing the command arguments.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, "{0}={1}".format(prop, val)]
    return command
```

By correcting the `_dict_arg` function as shown above, the bug causing the failing tests to produce incorrect results will be fixed.
