### Analysis:
1. The `SparkSubmitTask` class contains a `_dict_arg` method that is expected to convert a dictionary value into a list of arguments. The test cases are failing because the generated arguments do not match the expected arguments.
2. The bug in the `_dict_arg` function seems to be related to incorrectly formatting the key-value pairs in the dictionary.
3. The error messages indicate that there is an issue with the way the `Prop=Value` pair is being copied over to the list of commands. The quotes around the value are causing the mismatch with the expected output.
4. The bug can be fixed by removing the quotes around the `{0}={1}` format in the code snippet for building the command list.

### Bug Fix:
Here is the corrected version of the `_dict_arg` function:

```python
class SparkSubmitTask(luigi.Task):
    """
    Template task for running a Spark job
    
    Supports running jobs on Spark local, standalone, Mesos or Yarn
    
    See http://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/submitting-applications.html
    for more information
    """


    def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
        command = []
        if value and isinstance(value, dict):
            for prop, value in value.items():
                command += [name, '{0}={1}'.format(prop, value)]
        return command
```

By removing the quotes around the `{0}={1}` format in the string interpolation, the function no longer inserts the key-value pairs enclosed in quotes, which should align with the expected output defined in the test cases.
