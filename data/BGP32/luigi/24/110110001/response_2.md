### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_dict_arg` within the `SparkSubmitTask` class in the `luigi.contrib.spark` module is intended to convert a dictionary argument into a list of command-line arguments.
2. The failing tests are comparing the expected list of arguments with the actual list of arguments generated by the `_dict_arg` function.
3. The errors in the failing tests are due to extra double quotes around values in the generated list of arguments.
4. The bug originates from the formatting of the argument value within the loop iteration.
5. A strategy to fix the bug is to ensure that the arguments are concatenated without additional quotes around the argument values.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
class SparkSubmitTask(luigi.Task):
    """
    Template task for running a Spark job
    
    Supports running jobs on Spark local, standalone, Mesos or Yarn
    
    See http://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/submitting-applications.html
    for more information
    """

    def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
        command = []
        if value and isinstance(value, dict):
            for prop, val in value.items():
                command += [name, '{0}={1}'.format(prop, val)]
        return command
```

By removing the extra double quotes around `{1}` in the format string used within the loop, the corrected version of the `_dict_arg` function should now correctly generate the expected list of command-line arguments for the SparkSubmitTask class.
