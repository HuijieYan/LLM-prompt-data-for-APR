### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_dict_arg` is part of the `SparkSubmitTask` class in the `luigi.contrib.spark` module.
2. The function is intended to create a command list based on a dictionary input.
3. The failing tests indicate that the function is not handling the dictionary properly, resulting in differences in the generated command list.
4. The main cause of the bug is how the function iterates over the dictionary values and formats them into the command list.
5. The issues in the function are related to how it handles individual key-value pairs in the dictionary and formats them into the command list.

### Bug Cause:
- The buggy function is converting key-value pairs from the dictionary into a string format with quotes around the values. This is not necessary for command line arguments.
- This formatting issue results in discrepancies between the expected command list and the actual command list generated by the function.

### Fix Strategy:
- Modify the function to correctly iterate over the dictionary key-value pairs, adding each key-value pair directly to the command list without unnecessary string formatting.

### Corrected Version:
```python
class SparkSubmitTask(luigi.Task):
    def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
        command = []
        if value and isinstance(value, dict):
            for prop, val in value.items():
                command += [name, prop + '=' + val]
        return command
``` 

In the corrected version, we directly concatenate the key and value without unnecessary string formatting. This change ensures that the command list is generated correctly and matches the expected format in the tests.
