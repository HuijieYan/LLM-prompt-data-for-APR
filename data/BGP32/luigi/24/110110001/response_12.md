### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_dict_arg` within the `SparkSubmitTask` class is designed to take a name and a dictionary as inputs, then format the dictionary items into a list of command arguments.
2. The error message indicates a difference in the format of the command arguments between the expected result and the actual result.
3. The issue appears to be related to how the function is formatting the dictionary values, causing discrepancies in the generated command.
4. To fix the bug, the function needs to correctly format and append the dictionary key-value pairs to the command list without adding extra quotes.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Modify the function `_dict_arg` to correctly generate and format command arguments from the dictionary provided.
2. Remove unnecessary quotes around the dictionary values in the command.
3. Update the function to correctly add the key-value pairs to the command list without introducing extra characters.

### Corrected Version of the `_dict_arg` Function:
```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, '{0}={1}'.format(prop, val)]
    return command
```

With this corrected version of the function, the formatting of the command arguments should be more accurate and aligned with the expected results in the tests.
