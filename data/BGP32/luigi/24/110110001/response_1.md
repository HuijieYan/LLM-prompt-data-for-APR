### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_dict_arg` is within the `SparkSubmitTask` class in the `luigi/contrib/spark.py` file.
2. The function takes two parameters: `name` and `value`, and constructs a command based on the key-value pairs in the input dictionary.
3. The failing tests show the presence of discrepancies in the constructed command between expected and actual values, specifically related to the format of values in the command list.
4. The error message indicates that the constructed commands are not as expected due to formatting issues in handling dictionary values.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is caused by the way the `value` component of the dictionary is being formatted in the constructed command list. The function is wrapping the value in double quotes which is causing the comparison to fail in the test due to inconsistencies in expected and actual values.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to modify the way we format the value component of the dictionary key-value pairs. Instead of wrapping the value in double quotes, we should directly include the value in the command list without any additional formatting.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, "{0}={1}".format(prop, val)]
    return command
```

In the corrected version, we iterate over the dictionary items, constructing the command list by directly appending the key-value pairs without any additional formatting. This change should resolve the formatting inconsistencies and allow the test cases to pass successfully.
