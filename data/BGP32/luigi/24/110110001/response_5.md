### Analysis:
1. The buggy function is `_dict_arg` within the `SparkSubmitTask` class in the `luigi.contrib.spark.py` file.
2. The function is intended to convert a dictionary into arguments for a command.
3. The error messages from the failing tests indicate that the function is not correctly handling dictionary key-value pairs and is producing unexpected output when constructing the command arguments.
4. The bug is likely due to the fact that the function is wrapping the values with quotes unnecessarily, leading to incorrect comparisons in the test cases.
5. To fix the bug, we need to modify the function so that it generates the command arguments by properly handling dictionary key-value pairs without unnecessary quotes.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Update the `_dict_arg` function to correctly iterate over the key-value pairs of the input dictionary and construct the command.
2. Remove unnecessary quotes around the values when constructing the command.
3. Ensure that the function produces the output in a format that matches the expected format in the test cases.

### Corrected Version:
```python
class SparkSubmitTask(luigi.Task):
    """
    Template task for running a Spark job
    
    Supports running jobs on Spark local, standalone, Mesos, or Yarn
    
    See http://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/submitting-applications.html
    for more information
    """

    def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
        command = []
        if value and isinstance(value, dict):
            for prop, val in value.items():
                command += [name, '{0}={1}'.format(prop, val)]
        return command
```

By making these changes to the `_dict_arg` function, it should now correctly construct the command arguments without introducing unnecessary quotes around the values. This correction should address the issues observed in the failing test cases.
