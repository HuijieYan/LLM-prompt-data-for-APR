## Analysis:
The `_dict_arg` function in the SparkSubmitTask class is currently generating a list of command arguments, but it is incorrectly handling the dictionary values. The function is appending key-value pairs as strings wrapped in double quotes, which is causing the test cases to fail.

The failing test cases are comparing the actual command arguments generated by the `_dict_arg` function with the expected command arguments. The comparison fails due to the formatting of the dictionary values in the function output.

## Potential Error Locations:
1. The use of double quotes around the value when constructing key-value pairs inside the function.
2. The way the command list is built using `+=` instead of `append()`.

## Cause of the Bug:
The bug arises from the incorrect handling of dictionary values inside the `_dict_arg` function. When constructing the command list, the function wraps the values of dictionary items in double quotes. This results in a mismatch between the expected and actual command arguments in the test cases leading to failures.

## Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the dictionary values are added to the command list without being wrapped in double quotes. Additionally, we should use `append()` to add elements to the list instead of using `+=` to concatenate lists.

## Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command.append(name)
            command.append("{0}={1}".format(prop, val))
    return command
```

In the corrected version, we are directly adding the key-value pairs to the `command` list without wrapping the values in double quotes. This will ensure that the command arguments are constructed correctly and match the expected values in the test cases.
