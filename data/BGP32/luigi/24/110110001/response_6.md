### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_dict_arg` is expected to process a dictionary and format it correctly to be used as command arguments.
2. The function checks if the `value` parameter is a dictionary, and if so, it iterates over the items in the dictionary and generates a formatted string.
3. The cause of the bug is that in the line `command += [name, '"{0}={1}"'.format(prop, value)]`, the value is being enclosed in double quotes, which causes a discrepancy when compared to the expected command list.
4. The bug needs to be fixed by removing the double quotes from the generated command list.

### Bug Fix:
1. Modified the bug function to remove the double quotes while generating arguments from the dictionary.
