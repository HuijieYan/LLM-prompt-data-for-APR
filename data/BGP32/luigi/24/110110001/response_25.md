1. Analyzing the buggy function:
The buggy function is `_dict_arg` within the `SparkSubmitTask` class in the `luigi.contrib.spark` module. The purpose of this function is to take a key-value pair and convert it into a list of command arguments for a Spark task execution. It checks if the value is a dictionary and then iterates over its items to create the command arguments.

2. Potential error locations:
The error seems to be related to the formatting of the key-value pairs within the command list. The error messages indicate that the formatting is different from what is expected.

3. Cause of the bug:
The error is caused by the way the function is constructing the command list from the dictionary items. The extra quotes around the values in the command list are causing the assertion errors in the tests.

4. Strategy for fixing the bug:
To fix the bug, we should remove the unnecessary quotes around the values when constructing the command list from the dictionary items.

5. Corrected version of the `_dict_arg` function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, '{0}={1}'.format(prop, val)]
    return command
```

By removing the unnecessary double quotes around `{1}` in the format string, the corrected version of the function should properly construct the command list without the extra quotes. This should resolve the assertion errors in the failing tests.
