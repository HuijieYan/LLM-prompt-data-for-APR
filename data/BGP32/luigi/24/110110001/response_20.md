### Explanation:
1. The buggy function `_dict_arg` is designed to take a dictionary `value` and convert it into a list of command-line arguments. However, there are issues in the way the dictionary values are being processed and converted to strings. This causes discrepancies with the expected command list.
2. The key issue arises when constructing the command list using the dictionary items. The buggy function is incorrectly trying to format the key and value pair as a string enclosed in double quotes, leading to discrepancies with the expected output.
3. The failing tests provide examples of the discrepancies in the command list elements due to incorrect formatting of values in the dictionary. This causes the test assertions to fail, highlighting the bug in the function.
4. To fix the bug, we need to modify how the key-value pairs are formatted in the command list. Instead of enclosing the entire key-value pair in quotes, only the value part should be enclosed in quotes when needed (e.g., when value contains spaces).
5. Here is the corrected version of the `_dict_arg` function to address the bug:

### Corrected Version:
```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            if ' ' in val:  # Check if the value contains spaces
                command += [name, '{0}="{1}"'.format(prop, val)]
            else:
                command += [name, '{0}={1}'.format(prop, val)]
    return command
```

By modifying the formatting of the key-value pairs based on the presence of spaces in the value, we ensure that the command list generated by the `_dict_arg` function matches the expected command list in the tests.
