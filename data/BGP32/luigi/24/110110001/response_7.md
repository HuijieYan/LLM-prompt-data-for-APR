## Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_dict_arg` in the `SparkSubmitTask` class is responsible for constructing a command list based on a dictionary input. The expected behavior is to create a list of key-value pairs in the form of property=value.
2. The buggy function adds unnecessary double quotes around the property=value pair, which causes the test cases to fail due to discrepancies in the formatting of the command list.
3. The failing test cases explicitly expect the command list elements to be in the format 'prop=value' without quotes. The presence of quotes (`"prop=value"`) in the output from the `_dict_arg` function leads to assertion errors.
4. To fix the bug, we need to remove the unnecessary quotes around the property=value pairs in the command list generated by the `_dict_arg` function.

## Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
1. Modify the `_dict_arg` function to generate the command list in the correct format without adding quotes around the property=value pairs.
2. Update the logic to ensure that the elements appended to the command list are directly in the form `prop=value`.

## Corrected Version:
```python
import luigi

class SparkSubmitTask(luigi.Task):
    """
    Template task for running a Spark job
    
    Supports running jobs on Spark local, standalone, Mesos or Yarn
    
    See http://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/submitting-applications.html
    for more information
    """

    def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
        command = []
        if value and isinstance(value, dict):
            for prop, val in value.items():
                command += [name, '{0}={1}'.format(prop, val)]
        return command
```

By updating the `_dict_arg` function to generate command list elements without quotes, the corrected code will now correctly format the command list and pass the failing test cases.
