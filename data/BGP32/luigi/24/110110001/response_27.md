The buggy function `_dict_arg` is intended to construct a command based on the input dictionary `value` by iterating over key-value pairs in the dictionary. However, there are a couple of issues in the current implementation:

1. The function is updating the `command` list within the loop for each key-value pair. This causes the command list to keep growing with each iteration, resulting in unnecessary repetition of flags.

2. The function incorrectly surrounds the values with double quotes, but this is not needed and leads to extra characters in the command list.

To fix the bug, the function should simply construct the command list by appending elements without any quotes or additional processing.

Here is a corrected version of the `_dict_arg` function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, '{0}={1}'.format(prop, val)]
    return command
```

With this corrected version, the function will correctly build the command list by simply concatenating the key-value pairs without adding unnecessary quotes or repetitions.

Running the failing test cases with this corrected version should now pass without any AssertionError.
