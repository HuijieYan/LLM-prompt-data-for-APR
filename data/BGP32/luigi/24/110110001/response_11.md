## Analysis
1. The buggy function `_dict_arg` is part of the `SparkSubmitTask` class in the `luigi.contrib.spark` module.
2. The buggy function is supposed to generate command arguments based on a dictionary input.
3. The failing tests are checking if the command arguments generated by the function match the expected command arguments, but they are failing due to unexpected formatting issues.
4. The cause of the bug is that the function is incorrectly adding double quotes to the values in the generated command arguments.
5. To fix the bug, the function should not add double quotes to the dictionary values when generating the command arguments.
6. We need to modify the function to correctly generate command arguments without adding unnecessary quotes to the values.

## Corrected Version
```python
class SparkSubmitTask(luigi.Task):
    """
    Template task for running a Spark job
    
    Supports running jobs on Spark local, standalone, Mesos, or Yarn
    
    See http://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/submitting-applications.html
    for more information
    """

    def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
        command = []
        if value and isinstance(value, dict):
            for prop, val in value.items():
                command += [name, '{0}={1}'.format(prop, val)]
        return command
```

By removing the double quotes around the format of property-value pairs in the command arguments, the corrected version will now generate the command arguments as expected by the test cases, fixing the bug.
