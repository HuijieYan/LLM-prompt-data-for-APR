### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_dict_arg` is intended to process a dictionary argument and generate a list of commands.
2. The function iterates over the items in the input dictionary, constructs a formatted string, and appends it to the `command` list.
3. The bug occurs when constructing the formatted string within the loop, resulting in extra double quotes ("") around the values.
4. This extra double quote causes the test to fail as the expected output does not have quotes around the values.
5. To fix the bug, we need to remove the extra double quotes from around the values in the formatted string.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, "{0}={1}".format(prop, val)]
    return command
```

### Explanation of Fix:
- In the corrected version, the formatted string no longer includes double quotes around the values.
- By removing the extra double quotes, the function now correctly constructs the command list.
- This change ensures that the output matches the expected format in the test cases, resolving the failing tests.
