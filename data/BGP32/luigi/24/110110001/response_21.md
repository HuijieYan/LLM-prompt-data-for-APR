### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_dict_arg` is part of the `SparkSubmitTask` class in the `luigi/contrib/spark.py` file.
2. The failing test is testing the behavior of the `SparkSubmitTask` class by creating an instance of a subclass of it and calling the `run` method.
3. The error messages show that the assertion failures are due to differences in the format of the arguments passed to the `proc` object created using `subprocess.Popen` in the test.
4. The bug in the `_dict_arg` function is causing the values to be enclosed in quotes when building the command list, which is not expected by the test.

### Bug Cause:
The buggy function `_dict_arg` is incorrectly handling the build-up of the command list for execution, which is expected to be a list of strings. The issue arises because the `value.items()` loop is adding items to the command list with quotes around the values generated by the `format` method.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
Correct the `_dict_arg` function to build the command list without adding quotes around the values. We can achieve this by directly appending the values without formatting them in the form of a string. This will ensure that the elements in the command list are treated as individual arguments without additional quoting.

### Corrected Version:
```python
class SparkSubmitTask(luigi.Task):
    """
    Template task for running a Spark job
    
    Supports running jobs on Spark local, standalone, Mesos or Yarn
    
    See http://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/submitting-applications.html
    for more information
    """

    def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
        command = []
        if value and isinstance(value, dict):
            for prop, val in value.items():
                command += [name, "{0}={1}".format(prop, val)]
        return command
``` 

By updating the `_dict_arg` function as shown above, the corrected version should now correctly build the command list without adding unnecessary quotes around the values passed to it. This correction should resolve the failing test cases.
