### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_dict_arg` is a method of the `SparkSubmitTask` class which is intended to generate a command list based on a dictionary input.
2. The buggy function processes the input dictionary incorrectly, resulting in incorrect element formatting in the command list.
3. The failing tests indicate that the command list generated by the `_dict_arg` function does not match the expected command list, leading to assertion errors due to mismatched elements.
4. To fix the bug, we need to modify how the function handles dictionary values and how it constructs the command list.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Iterate over all key-value pairs in the input dictionary.
2. Format each pair as `prop=value` within the command list directly instead of wrapping in quotes.
3. Append each formatted key-value pair along with the name prefix to the command list.
4. Return the complete command list.

### Corrected Version:
```python
class SparkSubmitTask(luigi.Task):
    """
    Template task for running a Spark job
    
    Supports running jobs on Spark local, standalone, Mesos or Yarn
    
    See http://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/submitting-applications.html
    for more information
    """

    def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
        command = []
        if value and isinstance(value, dict):
            for prop, val in value.items():  # renaming 'value' to 'val' to avoid conflict
                command += [name, '{0}={1}'.format(prop, val)]  # Formatting as prop=value directly
        return command
```

By correcting the `_dict_arg` function as shown above, the function will now correctly generate the command list based on the input dictionary. This correction should make the function compatible with the failing tests and prevent the assertion errors.
