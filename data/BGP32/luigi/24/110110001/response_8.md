### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_dict_arg` is within the class `SparkSubmitTask` which is a template task for running a Spark job. The function is supposed to create a list to be used as a command for submitting a Spark job.
2. The function is intended to iterate over a dictionary provided as an argument and append key-value pairs formatted as strings to a list named `command`.
3. The failing test cases include arguments and expected results for submitting Spark jobs using different configurations. The error messages indicate that the function is not handling the dictionary values correctly, resulting in mismatched list elements when compared to the expected results.
4. The bug is caused by incorrectly formatting the key-value pairs within the loop that iterates over the dictionary values. The current implementation adds unnecessary quotes around the value when creating the command list elements, causing discrepancies in the list structure and failing the comparison with the expected result.
5. To fix the bug, we need to remove the unnecessary quotes around the values being added to the `command` list.

### Bug Fix:
Here is the corrected version of the `_dict_arg` function to handle dictionary values without unnecessary quotes:

```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: luigi/contrib/spark.py

# The declaration of the class containing the buggy function
class SparkSubmitTask(luigi.Task):
    """
    Template task for running a Spark job
    
    Supports running jobs on Spark local, standalone, Mesos or Yarn
    
    See http://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/submitting-applications.html
    for more information
    """

    def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
        command = []
        if value and isinstance(value, dict):
            for prop, value in value.items():
                command += [name, '{0}={1}'.format(prop, value)]  # Fixed formatting here
        return command
```

By modifying the format string used to concatenate the key-value pairs in the list, we can ensure that the values are added without any unnecessary quotes. This should resolve the issue of mismatched list elements in the failing test cases.
