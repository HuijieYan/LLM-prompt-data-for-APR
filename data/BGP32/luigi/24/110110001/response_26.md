### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_dict_arg` is located in the class `SparkSubmitTask` which is a template task for running a Spark job.
2. The buggy function is designed to process and translate a dictionary of arguments into a list of command-line arguments.
3. The failing test cases show that the function fails to properly format the dictionary values into a list of command-line arguments, resulting in differences in the expected and actual command arguments.
4. The error messages indicate that the formatting of the dictionary key-value pairs is causing the discrepancies between the expected and actual command arguments. The buggy function is using unnecessary quotes around the property values.
5. To fix the bug, the unnecessary quotes should be removed from the property values when constructing the command list.

### Bug Fix:
```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, value in value.items():
            command += [name, '{0}={1}'.format(prop, value)]
    return command
```

### Updated Code Explanation:
- Removed unnecessary quotes around the `{0}={1}` format string in the `command` list construction. This change ensures that the property values are without quotes in the resulting command string.
- By removing the quotes, the function now correctly constructs the command list without introducing any string formatting issues.

With this fix, the corrected version of the `_dict_arg` function should now properly translate the dictionary values into a list of command-line arguments, passing the previously failing test cases.
