1. The buggy function `_dict_arg` is located within the `SparkSubmitTask` class in the `luigi.contrib.spark` module. The function is intended to take a dictionary, iterate over its key-value pairs, and construct a list of strings where each string represents a key-value pair with proper formatting for command-line arguments. The function currently has a bug where it incorrectly formats the key-value pair by including unnecessary quotations in the value part of the pair.

2. The potential error location within the `_dict_arg` function is in the line that formats the key-value pair:
```python
command += [name, '"{0}={1}"'.format(prop, value)]
```
The bug is caused by using double quotes when formatting the value part of the key-value pair, which adds unnecessary characters to the final command list.

3. The cause of the bug is that the `py-files`, `conf`, and `prop1=val1` parameters in the test cases are dictionaries that are being passed to the `_dict_arg` function for processing. However, due to the incorrect formatting within the function, the resulting command list includes unnecessary double quotes around the values of these parameters. This causes the generated command list to differ from the expected command list in the test cases, leading to assertion errors during testing.

4. To fix the bug, the formatting of the key-value pair needs to be adjusted in the `_dict_arg` function so that the double quotes are removed from around the value and only added around the key part when necessary.

5. Below is the corrected version of the `_dict_arg` function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, prop_value in value.items():
            command += [name, '{0}={1}'.format(prop, prop_value)]
    return command
```

In the corrected version, the formatting of the key-value pair has been adjusted to remove unnecessary double quotes around the value. This change should ensure that the command list generated by the `_dict_arg` function aligns with the expected command list in the test cases, allowing the tests to pass successfully.
