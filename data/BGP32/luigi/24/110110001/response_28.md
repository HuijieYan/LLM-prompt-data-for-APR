### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_dict_arg` is part of the `SparkSubmitTask` class in the `luigi.contrib.spark` module.
2. The function attempts to create a command list based on a dictionary argument provided.
3. The failing tests suggest that the function is not correctly handling the dictionary argument transformation to command list, resulting in failing assertions due to mismatched elements in the command list.
4. The cause of the bug seems to be the way the function is handling dictionary key-value pairs by enclosing the value in double quotes, leading to issues with assertions in the tests.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that key-value pairs from the dictionary are transformed into individual elements of the command list without any additional quotes added around the values.

### Corrected Version:
```python
class SparkSubmitTask(luigi.Task):
    def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
        command = []
        if value and isinstance(value, dict):
            for prop, val in value.items():
                command += [name, '{0}={1}'.format(prop, val)]
        return command
```

By modifying the line `command += [name, '"{0}={1}"'.format(prop, value)]` to `command += [name, '{0}={1}'.format(prop, val)]`, we resolve the issue of extra quotes around the values in the command list.
