### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_dict_arg` takes in two parameters `name` and `value`, where `value` is expected to be a dictionary.
2. The function iterates over the items in the dictionary and constructs a list of command arguments based on the key-value pairs in the dictionary.
3. The issue in the current implementation lies in the line where the function constructs the command by formatting key-value pairs as strings. It adds unnecessary quotes around the values when adding them to the `command` list.
4. This causes the error in the test cases because the expected arguments in the test cases do not have values wrapped in double quotes, leading to a mismatch in the comparison.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix this bug, we should remove the unnecessary double quotes around the values while constructing the command list in the `_dict_arg` function. This will align the behavior of the function with the expected arguments in the test cases.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, "{0}={1}".format(prop, val)]  # Removed unnecessary quotes around the value
    return command
```

By making this change, the corrected version of the `_dict_arg` function should now pass the failing test cases provided.
