### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_dict_arg` in the `SparkSubmitTask` class incorrectly formats the dictionary values without considering quotes. This leads to a mismatch in the final command list when comparing it in the test functions.
2. The error is caused by the use of unnecessary double quotes around the property value when generating the command list in the `_dict_arg` function.
3. The failing tests are asserting the command list generated by the `_dict_arg` function, and the mismatch in quotes causes the test to fail.
4. To fix the bug, we need to remove the unnecessary double quotes from around the property values when constructing the command list.
5. Here is the corrected version of the `_dict_arg` function:

### Corrected Function:
```python
# The corrected _dict_arg function
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, '{0}={1}'.format(prop, val)]
    return command
``` 

With this correction, the unnecessary double quotes around the property values have been removed, and the test functions should pass without any assertion errors.
