The bug in the `_dict_arg` function lies in the unnecessary double quoting of the key-value pair in the command list. This causes the output to have incorrect formatting with extra quotes around the key-value pairs.

To fix the bug, we need to remove the unnecessary double quotes around the key-value pairs in the command list.

Here is the corrected version of the `_dict_arg` function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, "{0}={1}".format(prop, val)]
    return command
```

Now, the function will generate the expected output format without extra quotes around the key-value pairs.
