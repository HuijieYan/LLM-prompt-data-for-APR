### Bug Analysis:
The bug in the `_dict_arg` function lies in how the key-value pairs from the input dictionary `value` are being formatted and added to the `command` list. The current implementation is using double quotes around the key-value pairs, which is incorrect according to the expected output values. It should not include double quotes around the key-value pairs.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to update the formatting inside the list comprehension that adds the key-value pairs to the `command` list. We should remove the double quotes around the key-value pairs to match the expected output values.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, '{0}={1}'.format(prop, val)]
    return command
``` 

This corrected version ensures that the key-value pairs are formatted correctly without including unnecessary double quotes, matching the expected output values for the given test cases.
