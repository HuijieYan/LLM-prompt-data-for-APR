The cause of the bug in the provided function `_dict_arg` is that when constructing the command list, it is wrapping the property-value pair in double quotes (`"prop=value"`), which is unnecessary. This results in the command list containing extra quotes, causing the output to deviate from the expected format.

To fix this bug, we should remove the unnecessary double quotes when appending the property-value pair to the command list.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, '{0}={1}'.format(prop, val)]
    return command
```

By making this adjustment, the function will correctly construct the command list with property-value pairs in the expected format without unnecessary quotes. This updated version will produce the expected output for the provided test cases.
