The bug in the `_dict_arg` function stems from incorrectly constructing the command list by including unnecessary quotation marks around the key-value pairs. This leads to an incorrect output format.

To fix the bug, we should remove the quotation marks around the key-value pairs in the command list construction to match the expected format.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, '{0}={1}'.format(prop, val)]
    return command
```

By removing the unnecessary quotation marks around the key-value pairs, the function will now construct the `command` list in the correct format as expected. This change aligns with the expected input/output values provided for the test cases.
