### Bug Explanation
The bug in the `_dict_arg` function lies in the way the values are being concatenated to the `command` list. The current implementation adds the value wrapped in double quotes, causing the output to be incorrect. The expected output should have the key-value pairs without quotes around them.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix this bug, we need to adjust how the key-value pairs are added to the `command` list. Instead of wrapping them in double quotes, we should concatenate them directly without any additional characters.

### Corrected Version of the Function
```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, '{0}={1}'.format(prop, val)]
    return command
``` 

With this correction, the key-value pairs will be added to the `command` list without any extra characters, fulfilling the expected output values for the given test cases.
