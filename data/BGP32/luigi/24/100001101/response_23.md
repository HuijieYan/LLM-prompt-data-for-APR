The bug in the function `_dict_arg` lies in the way the key-value pairs are formatted and added to the `command` list. The current implementation adds unnecessary quotations around the key-value pairs, which is causing the output to differ from the expected values.

To fix this bug, we can modify the formatting of the key-value pairs to directly concatenate them without quotations. Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command.append(name)
            command.append("{0}={1}".format(prop, val))
    return command
```

Explanation of the bug and fix:
- The bug was caused by adding unnecessary double quotations around the key-value pairs in the command list.
- The correction removes the quotations and simply concatenates the key and value pairs separated by an equal sign.

This corrected version should now output the expected values in both Case 1 and Case 2 as provided.
