The bug in the `_dict_arg` function is caused by the unnecessary double quotes around the key-value pairs in the command list. The bug occurs because the function incorrectly formats the key-value pairs with double quotes, which is not needed.

To fix the bug, we should remove the double quotes from the format string in the list concatenation.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, "{0}={1}".format(prop, val)]
    return command
```

Now, the function should correctly format the key-value pairs without unnecessary double quotes and provide the expected output values.
