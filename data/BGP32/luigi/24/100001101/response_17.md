The bug in the provided function lies in the formatting of the command list. The function mistakenly adds double quotes around the key-value pairs in the command list, which is causing the mismatch in the expected and actual outputs. To fix this bug, we should remove the double quotes when formatting the key-value pairs in the command list.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, '{0}={1}'.format(prop, val)]
    return command
```

With this correction, the function correctly formats the key-value pairs without adding unnecessary double quotes. This will align with the expected output values mentioned in the test cases.
