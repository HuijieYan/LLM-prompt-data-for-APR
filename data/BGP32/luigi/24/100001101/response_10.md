The bug in the `_dict_arg` function is due to the incorrect formatting of the command elements when creating the list. The current implementation mistakenly includes double quotes around the value assignment, resulting in unexpected output.

To fix the bug, we need to remove the unnecessary double quotes in the string formatting. Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, "{0}={1}".format(prop, val)]
    return command
```

This corrected version eliminates the double quotes in the string formatting, ensuring that the command list is created correctly with the expected format.

With this fix, the function should now output the correct values as expected in both Case 1 and Case 2.
