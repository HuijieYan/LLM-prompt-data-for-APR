The bug in the `_dict_arg` function arises from the incorrect string formatting in the line `command += [name, '"{0}={1}"'.format(prop, value)]`. The additional double quotes around the format string are unnecessary and causing the output to include unwanted double quotes around the property-value pair.

To fix this bug, we should remove the unnecessary double quotes in the format string. Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():  # Changed 'value' to 'val' to avoid variable name conflict
            command += [name, "{0}={1}".format(prop, val)]  # Removed unnecessary double quotes
    return command
```

By making this change, the function should now correctly format the property-value pairs without including the extra double quotes.
