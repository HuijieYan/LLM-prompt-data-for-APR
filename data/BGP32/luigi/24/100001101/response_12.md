### Bug Explanation
The bug in the `_dict_arg` function lies in the way the values are being formatted before adding them to the `command` list. The function is currently adding double quotes around the `prop=value` pairs, which is not the expected format. The expected format should be `prop=value` without the quotes.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to remove the double quotes from the format string used to construct each command before adding it to the `command` list.

### Corrected Version of the Function
```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, "{0}={1}".format(prop, val)]
    return command
```

The corrected version of the function removes the unnecessary double quotes around the `prop=value` pairs. This change aligns with the expected output values for the test cases provided.
