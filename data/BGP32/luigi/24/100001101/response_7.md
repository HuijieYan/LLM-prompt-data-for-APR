The bug in the `_dict_arg` function lies in the way the values are being added to the `command` list. The bug stems from the unnecessary double-quoting of values when constructing the command list.

To fix the bug, we need to remove the extra quotes around the `{0}={1}` format in the `command` list to correctly format the `name` and value pairs without additional quotes.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, '{0}={1}'.format(prop, val)]
    return command
```

This corrected version eliminates the unnecessary double-quoting of values, as indicated in the bug analysis. It now properly constructs the `command` list as expected.
