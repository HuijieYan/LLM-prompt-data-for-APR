The issue in the buggy function arises from the unnecessary double quotes around the key-value pairs in the output list. The function is incorrectly adding the double quotes while formatting the string. It should return the key and value in the correct format without quotes.

To fix this bug, we need to remove the unnecessary double quotes from the format string and ensure that the key-value pairs are concatenated without quotes.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, '{0}={1}'.format(prop, val)]
    return command
```

This corrected version should now output the expected key-value pairs without additional quotes. The function should now format the strings correctly and return the expected results as outlined in the test cases.
