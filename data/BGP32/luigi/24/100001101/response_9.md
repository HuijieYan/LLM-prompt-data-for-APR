### Bug Explanation
The bug in the `_dict_arg` function arises from the fact that the current implementation adds unnecessary double quotes around the key and value pairs when constructing the command list. This results in an incorrect format for the command list.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to remove the double quotes around the key and value pairs in the `command` list construction. This can be achieved by modifying the format string in the list comprehension for building the `command` list.

### Corrected Version
```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, '{0}={1}'.format(prop, val)]
    return command
``` 

By removing the double quotes in the format string, we ensure that the command list is constructed in the correct format as expected in the test cases.
