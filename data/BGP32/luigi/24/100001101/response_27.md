The bug in the provided function is due to the unnecessary quotes added around the key-value pairs in the command list, resulting in incorrect formatting. To fix this bug, the quotes should be removed from the format string when generating the command list.

Here is a corrected version of the function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, '{0}={1}'.format(prop, val)]
    return command
```

By removing the unnecessary quotes around the key-value pairs in the format string, the corrected function will generate the command list without any unwanted characters. This change aligns with the expected output values provided for both test cases.
