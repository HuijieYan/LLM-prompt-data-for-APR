The bug in the function `_dict_arg` is related to the extra double quotes around the key-value pairs being added to the `command` list. This is causing the output to be incorrect compared to the expected values.

To fix the bug, we need to remove the double quotes around the key-value pairs in the `command` list.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, '{0}={1}'.format(prop, val)]
    return command
```

This corrected version of the function should now produce the expected output values for the given test cases.
