### Bug Explanation
The buggy function is not correctly formatting the key-value pairs from the input dictionary `value` into a string format that should be appended to the `command` list. The current implementation is enclosing both the property and the value in double quotes within the string interpolation, which is not necessary.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, remove the unnecessary double quotes around the property and value in the string interpolation when constructing the command list. This will ensure that the output matches the expected format.

### Corrected Version
```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, "{0}={1}".format(prop, val)]
    return command
```
