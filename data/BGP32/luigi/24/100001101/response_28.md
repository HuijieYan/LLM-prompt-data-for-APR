### Bug Explanation
The bug in the `_dict_arg` function stems from adding extra quotes around the `{key}={value}` pairs when constructing the `command` list. This leads to incorrect formatting of the key-value pairs, resulting in unexpected output values.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, it is necessary to remove the quotes around the key-value pairs in the `command` list construction. This can be achieved by modifying the format string used to concatenate the key and value.


### Corrected Version of the Function

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, '{0}={1}'.format(prop, val)]
    return command
```

In the corrected version, the `"{0}={1}"` format has been changed to `{0}={1}` to remove the unnecessary quotes. This will correctly format the key-value pairs in the `command` list.
