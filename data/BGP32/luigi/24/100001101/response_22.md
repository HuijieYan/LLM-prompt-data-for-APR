The bug in the provided function `_dict_arg` is caused by incorrectly formatting the key-value pairs in the command list. The function is adding unnecessary double quotes around the key-value pairs, which leads to the unexpected output.

To fix this bug, we need to remove the double quotes when appending the key-value pairs to the command list.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, '{0}={1}'.format(prop, val)]
    return command
```

By using `{0}={1}` instead of `"{0}={1}"`, we ensure that the key-value pairs are correctly formatted without unnecessary double quotes.

This corrected function will now generate the expected output for the provided test cases.
