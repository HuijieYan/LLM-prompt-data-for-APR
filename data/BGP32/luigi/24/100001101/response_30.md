The bug in the function `_dict_arg` is due to the unnecessary double quotes around the format of the key-value pair when constructing the command list. The current implementation adds double quotes around the property and value pairs, which is incorrect.

To fix the bug, we need to remove the double quotes around the format of the key-value pair in the command list construction.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, "{0}={1}".format(prop, val)]
    return command
```

With this correction, the function will correctly construct the command list without unnecessary double quotes around the key-value pairs. This will ensure that the expected output values match the actual output values for the given test cases.
