### Bug Explanation
The bug in the `_dict_arg` function lies in the way the values are added to the `command` list. The current implementation adds the values with double quotes around them, which is not the expected behavior based on the provided test cases and expected values.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to modify how the values are added to the `command` list. Instead of adding double quotes around the values, we should concatenate the `prop` and `value` directly without any quotes.

### Corrected Version of the Function
```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, '{0}={1}'.format(prop, val)]
    return command
``` 

With this corrected version, the function should now correctly output the expected values based on the provided test cases.
