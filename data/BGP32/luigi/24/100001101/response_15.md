The bug in the `_dict_arg` function is caused by adding extra quotes around the property-value pairs in the `command` list. The expected output does not include these extra quotes. To fix this bug, we need to remove the unnecessary quotes while formatting the property-value pairs.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, '{0}={1}'.format(prop, val)]
    return command
```

This corrected version removes the unnecessary quotes in the property-value pairs, aligning with the expected output values provided for the failing test cases.
