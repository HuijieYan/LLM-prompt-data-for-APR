### Bug Explanation
The bug in the `_dict_arg` function lies in the line `command += [name, '"{0}={1}"'.format(prop, value)]`. The issue stems from the fact that the value is being enclosed in double quotes within the format string, which is unnecessary and causing the output to have extra double quotes around the values.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to remove the unnecessary double quotes around the formatted `{1}` placeholder in the string. By making this adjustment, the function should correctly generate the command list without the additional quotes.

### Corrected Version of the Function
```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, '{0}={1}'.format(prop, val)]
    return command
```

By updating the line `command += [name, '{0}={1}'.format(prop, value)]` to `{1}` instead of `"{1}"`, the corrected function should now generate the command list without the extra double quotes.
