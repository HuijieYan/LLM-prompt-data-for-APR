The bug in the provided function `_dict_arg` lies in the way it handles the formatting of the key-value pairs in the dictionary. The current implementation incorrectly adds extra double quotes around the property-value pairs in the command list.

To fix the bug, we need to remove the extra double quotes from the format string that combines the property and value. The correct format should just include the property and value without any additional quotation marks.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, "{0}={1}".format(prop, val)]
    return command
```

This corrected version removes the unnecessary double quotes around the property-value pairs. Now, the function should correctly generate the command list with the expected format.
