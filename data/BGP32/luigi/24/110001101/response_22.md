The bug in the `_dict_arg` function occurs when constructing the command list. The current implementation adds unnecessary double quotes around the key-value pairs generated. This results in incorrect formatting of the command list.

To fix this bug, we need to remove the double quotes surrounding the key-value pairs in the command list.

Here is the corrected version of the `_dict_arg` function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, '{0}={1}'.format(prop, val)]
    return command
```

This corrected version will properly format the key-value pairs in the command list without adding unnecessary double quotes. This should satisfy the expected input/output values for the provided test cases.
