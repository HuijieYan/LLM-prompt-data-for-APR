### Analysis
The bug in the `_dict_arg` function lies in the way the properties and values are being formatted and concatenated into the `command` list. When constructing the command list, the values are being enclosed in double quotes, causing the command to be incorrectly formatted. Additionally, the property and value pairs are not separated by an equal sign, further contributing to the incorrect format.

### Bug cause
The bug is caused by the incorrect formatting of property-value pairs in the command list. The current implementation adds unnecessary double quotes around the value and does not separate the property and value with an equal sign. This leads to an incorrect command structure.

### Fix strategy
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the property and value pairs are concatenated correctly with an equal sign. We should also remove the unnecessary double quotes around the value when constructing the command list.

### Corrected version
```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, '{0}={1}'.format(prop, val)]
    return command
```


The corrected version of the `_dict_arg` function addresses the issues mentioned above. It correctly formats the property-value pairs in the command list by separating them with an equal sign and removing unnecessary double quotes. This version should now produce the expected output for the provided test cases.
