### Explanation
The bug in the `_dict_arg` function lies in how the command list is constructed. The bug stems from adding unnecessary double quotes around each key-value pair in the dictionary. This results in incorrect formatting of the command list.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug
To fix the bug, we need to remove the unnecessary double quotes around each key-value pair in the dictionary when constructing the command list.

### Corrected Version of the Function
```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, '{0}={1}'.format(prop, val)]
    return command
``` 

By making this change, the function should now correctly generate the command list without unnecessary double quotes, satisfying the expected output values for the provided cases.
