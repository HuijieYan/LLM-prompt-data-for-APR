The bug in the `_dict_arg` function is due to incorrect formatting of the command list when building it from the input dictionary. The function is currently adding extra quotes around the key-value pairs which is not required.

To fix this bug, we need to remove the extra quotes around the key-value pairs in the command list.

Here is the corrected version of the `_dict_arg` function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, '{0}={1}'.format(prop, val)]
    return command
```

With this correction, the function should now correctly format the key-value pairs from the input dictionary without adding unnecessary quotes. This will align with the expected output values provided for the given test cases.
