The buggy function fails to properly format the key-value pairs from the input dictionary into a string that should be appended to the command list. The use of double quotes around the formatted key-value pairs is unnecessary and leads to incorrect behavior.

To fix the bug, we need to remove the unnecessary double quotes around the formatted key-value pairs in the command list.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
# The declaration of the class containing the buggy function
class SparkSubmitTask(luigi.Task):
    """
    Template task for running a Spark job
    
    Supports running jobs on Spark local, standalone, Mesos or Yarn
    
    See http://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/submitting-applications.html
    for more information
    """

    def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
        command = []
        if value and isinstance(value, dict):
            for prop, val in value.items():
                command += [name, '{0}={1}'.format(prop, val)]
        return command
```

With this correction, the function should now correctly format the key-value pairs from the input dictionary into the command list without unnecessary double quotes.
