The issue in the provided function is due to incorrectly adding double quotes around the key-value pairs when constructing the command list. The expected behavior is to have the key-value pairs without quotes.

To fix this bug, we need to remove the unnecessary double quotes around the key-value pairs in the format function inside the for loop.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, value in value.items():
            command += [name, "{0}={1}".format(prop, value)]
            
    return command
```

With this correction, the function will correctly construct the command list with key-value pairs as expected in the test cases.
