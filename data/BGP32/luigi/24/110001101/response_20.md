### Analysis
The buggy function `_dict_arg` is intended to take a `name` and a `value` (which is expected to be a dictionary) and convert it into a list of command-line arguments. However, the function is incorrectly handling the dictionary values, resulting in incorrect formatting of the arguments.

### Bug
The bug is caused by the way the function is iterating over the dictionary items and building the command list. The function is using the same variable `value` to refer to the inner values of the dictionary and the overall `value` parameter, leading to incorrect formatting with extra quotes.

### Fix
To fix the bug, the inner loop variable should be named differently to avoid shadowing the outer `value` parameter. Additionally, the quotes around the key-value pairs should be removed to ensure the correct format of the command list.

### Corrected Version
```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for key, val in value.items():
            command += [name, '{0}={1}'.format(key, val)]
    return command
``` 

This corrected version of the function should now correctly construct the list of command-line arguments from the input dictionary without extra quotes and with the expected format.
