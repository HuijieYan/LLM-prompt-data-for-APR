The issue in the buggy function is with the formatting of the command list. The function is incorrectly adding extra quotes around the key-value pairs while constructing the command list, resulting in an incorrect format.

To fix the bug, we need to remove the extra quotes around the key-value pairs when constructing the command list.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
# The declaration of the class containing the corrected function
class SparkSubmitTask(luigi.Task):
    """
    Template task for running a Spark job

    Supports running jobs on Spark local, standalone, Mesos or Yarn

    See http://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/submitting-applications.html
    for more information
    """

    # this is the corrected function
    def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
        command = []
        if value and isinstance(value, dict):
            for prop, val in value.items():
                command += [name, '{0}={1}'.format(prop, val)]
        return command
```

This corrected version of the function should now properly format the command list with key-value pairs without unnecessary quotes, satisfying the expected input/output values.
