### Analysis
The buggy function `_dict_arg` is intended to convert a dictionary into a list of arguments. However, the current implementation is adding extra double quotes around the key-value pairs, which is not the expected behavior.

### Bug Cause
The bug is caused by the unnecessary quotes around the key-value pairs in the command list. This is due to the formatting of the string within the list concatenation operation.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug
To fix the bug, we need to remove the unnecessary double quotes in the string formatting for each key-value pair. We can achieve this by simply removing the double quotes around the `"{0}={1}"` in the `format` method.

### Corrected Version
```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, '{0}={1}'.format(prop, val)]
    return command
```

Now, with this corrected version, the function should properly format the dictionary items as key-value pairs without unnecessary quotes. This will align with the expected values and types in the given test cases.
