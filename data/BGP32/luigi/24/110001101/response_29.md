The issue in the provided code is the incorrect handling of the dictionary items when constructing the command list. The current implementation adds unnecessary quotation marks around the key-value pairs. This results in the unexpected output format.

To fix this bug and align with the expected output format, we need to remove the unnecessary quotation marks around the key-value pairs in the `command` list.

Here is the corrected version of the `_dict_arg` function:

```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: luigi/contrib/spark.py

class SparkSubmitTask(luigi.Task):
    """
    Template task for running a Spark job
    
    Supports running jobs on Spark local, standalone, Mesos or Yarn
    
    See http://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/submitting-applications.html
    for more information
    """

    def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
        command = []
        if value and isinstance(value, dict):
            for prop, value in value.items():
                command += [name, "{0}={1}".format(prop, value)]
        return command
```

With this correction, the function will now correctly construct the command list with key-value pairs in the expected format without unnecessary quotation marks. This should align with the provided test cases and produce the expected output.
