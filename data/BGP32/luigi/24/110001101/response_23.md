The bug in the `_dict_arg` function lies in the way the key-value pairs are being formatted and added to the `command` list. The bug occurs because the value should not be enclosed in double quotes along with the key when creating these key-value pairs.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the line where the key-value pairs are being added to the `command` list in the function. Instead of using double quotes around the value, we should directly concatenate the key and value with an equals sign.

Here is the corrected version of the `_dict_arg` function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, "{0}={1}".format(prop, val)]
    return command
```

With this correction, the function should now correctly format and add key-value pairs to the `command` list without unnecessary double quotes around the values. This will ensure that the function produces the expected output for the given input cases.
