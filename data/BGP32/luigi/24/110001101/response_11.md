### Bug Explanation
The bug in the `_dict_arg` function lies in the line where the values are being concatenated to the `command` list. The bug is caused by generating wrong string format while constructing the command list. The current implementation is adding extra double quotes around the property and value pair in the command list, which is incorrect.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to remove the unnecessary double quotes while constructing the command list. Instead of adding `"prop=value"`, we should just add `prop=value` to the command list.

### Corrected Version of the Function
```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():  # changed variable name to 'val' to avoid conflict
            command += [name, "{0}={1}".format(prop, val)]  # remove double quotes around prop and val
    return command
``` 

By making this correction, the function now correctly constructs the command list with the expected format, without unnecessary double quotes around the property and value pairs.
