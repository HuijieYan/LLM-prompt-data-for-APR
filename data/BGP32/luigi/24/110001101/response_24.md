### Analysis
The buggy function `_dict_arg` is intended to take a dictionary as input, iterate over its key-value pairs, and construct a command list based on the format `name prop=value`. However, the current implementation is adding unnecessary double quotes around the property-value pair, resulting in incorrect command formation.

### Bug Cause
The bug in the function arises from the unnecessary addition of double quotes around the property-value pair in the command list. This causes the final command to be incorrectly formatted.

### Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to remove the double quotes around the property-value pair in the command list while constructing the command.

### Corrected Version
```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, '{0}={1}'.format(prop, val)]
    return command
```

The corrected version of the function removes the unnecessary double quotes around the property-value pair in the command formation, ensuring that the command list is correctly formatted.
