### Bug explanation
The bug in the `_dict_arg` function lies in the way the values are being formatted and concatenated to the `command` list. Currently, the values are being wrapped in double quotes along with the property name, which is unnecessary and causing the `=` sign to be included in the quotes as part of the value. This is not the desired format for the arguments passed to SparkSubmitTask.

### Bug fix strategy
To fix the bug, we need to remove the unnecessary double quotes around the property value pair and only use the syntax `prop=value`. This will ensure that the arguments are correctly formatted as expected for the `SparkSubmitTask`.

### Corrected version of the function
```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, "{0}={1}".format(prop, val)]
    return command
```

By updating the formatting of the property value pairs in the `command` list, the corrected function will now generate the expected output as mentioned in the provided cases.
