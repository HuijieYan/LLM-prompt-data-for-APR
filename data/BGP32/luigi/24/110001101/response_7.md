The bug in the `_dict_arg` function arises from the incorrect formatting of the key-value pairs in the command list. The current implementation adds extra double quotes around the key-value pairs when constructing the command list. This results in an incorrect format of the command list.

To fix this bug, we need to remove the extra double quotes around the key-value pairs when constructing the command list. We can achieve this by modifying the string format inside the list comprehension.

Here is the corrected version of the `_dict_arg` function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, '{0}={1}'.format(prop, val)]
    return command
```

With this corrected implementation, the function should now correctly generate the command list with the expected format for the key-value pairs from the input dictionary.
