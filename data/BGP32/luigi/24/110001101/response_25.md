### Analysis
The buggy function `_dict_arg` is supposed to take a name and a dictionary as inputs, iterate over the dictionary's key-value pairs, and construct a list of strings formatted as `"{name}={key}={value}"`. However, the current implementation is adding unnecessary double quotes around the key-value pairs, which is not the expected behavior according to the provided input/output values.

### Bug Cause
The bug is caused by adding double quotes around the key-value pairs in the command list. This leads to the incorrect formatting of the final command list.

### Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to remove the unnecessary double quotes around the key-value pairs in the command list. This can be achieved by modifying the line where the string is formatted to remove the surrounding double quotes.

### Corrected Version

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command.append(f"{name}={prop}={val}")
    return command
```

By making this change, the corrected function will now properly construct the command list without unnecessary double quotes, satisfying the expected input/output values provided.
