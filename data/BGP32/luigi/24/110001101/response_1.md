The bug in the `_dict_arg` function is caused by incorrectly formatting the dictionary key-value pairs into a string with double quotes around the value. The correct format should not have double quotes around the value, according to the expected output values.

To fix the bug, we need to remove the double quotes around the formatted key-value pairs in the `command` list.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
class SparkSubmitTask(luigi.Task):
    """
    Template task for running a Spark job
    
    Supports running jobs on Spark local, standalone, Mesos or Yarn
    
    See http://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/submitting-applications.html
    for more information
    """

    def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
        command = []
        if value and isinstance(value, dict):
            for prop, val in value.items():
                command += [name, "{0}={1}".format(prop, val)]
        return command
```

By making this change, the function will correctly format the key-value pairs from the input dictionary without unnecessary double quotes around the values. This will match the expected output values provided in the cases.
