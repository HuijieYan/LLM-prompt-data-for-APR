### Analysis
The buggy function `_dict_arg` is intended to convert a dictionary into a list of strings where each key-value pair becomes a formatted string element in the list. However, there is an issue with the way the formatting is done, resulting in extra double quotes around the formatted key-value pairs.

### Bug Explanation
The bug is caused by the unnecessary double quotes (`"`) around the formatted key-value pairs in the resulting list. This is due to the incorrect usage of double quotes in the list concatenation within the loop.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to remove the double quotes around the formatted key-value pairs so that the resulting list elements are formatted correctly.

### Corrected Version
```python
class SparkSubmitTask(luigi.Task):

    def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
        command = []
        if value and isinstance(value, dict):
            for prop, val in value.items():
                command += [name, '{0}={1}'.format(prop, val)]
        return command
``` 

The corrected version removes the unnecessary double quotes around the formatted key-value pairs, ensuring that the output is as expected.
