The bug in the `_dict_arg` function is caused by incorrectly adding quotes around the key-value pairs when constructing the command list. This causes the output to have unwanted double quotes around the key-value pairs.

To fix this bug, we need to remove the double quotes around the key-value pairs when constructing the command list. Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
class SparkSubmitTask(luigi.Task):
    def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
        command = []
        if value and isinstance(value, dict):
            for prop, val in value.items():
                command += [name, '{0}={1}'.format(prop, val)]
        return command
```

This correction ensures that the key-value pairs are formatted correctly without unnecessary double quotes, satisfying the expected input/output values provided for both cases. Running the tests with this corrected version should now pass successfully.
