### Analysis:
The buggy function `_dict_arg` is intended to construct a list of command arguments by iterating over the key-value pairs in a dictionary. However, the bug lies in how the key-value pairs are formatted before being added to the `command` list. The current implementation encloses the key-value pairs within double quotes, which leads to incorrect formatting.

### Bug Cause:
The bug stems from the line `command += [name, '"{0}={1}"'.format(prop, value)]`. The double quotes surrounding `{0}={1}` in the format statement cause the key-value pair to be enclosed within quotes when added to the `command` list.

### Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to remove the double quotes around `{0}={1}` in the format statement to ensure that the key-value pairs are added to the `command` list without being enclosed within quotes.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, '{0}={1}'.format(prop, val)]
    return command
```

With this correction, the key-value pairs will be added to the `command` list in the format `prop=val` without any additional quotes, satisfying the expected output values for the provided test cases.
