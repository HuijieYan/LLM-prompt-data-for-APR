The issue in the buggy function is that it is adding unnecessary quotes around the key-value pairs when constructing the `command` list. This is causing the command list to have incorrect format and resulting in incorrect output.

To fix this bug, we need to remove the quotes around the key-value pairs when constructing the `command` list.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
# The corrected version of the buggy function
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, "{0}={1}".format(prop, val)]
    return command
```

With this correction, the function will construct the `command` list correctly without unnecessary quotes around the key-value pairs. This will result in the expected output values mentioned in the expected test cases.
