### Analysis
The buggy function `_dict_arg` is supposed to take a dictionary `value` and convert it into a list of command arguments based on the key-value pairs in the dictionary. The issue lies in how the key-value pairs are being formatted in the command list. Instead of simply adding the key and value without quotes and equal sign, the buggy function is incorrectly adding quotes around the entire key-value pair.

### Bug Cause
The bug is caused by the incorrect formatting of the key-value pairs in the command list. This results in extra quotes around the key-value pairs, which is not the expected format for command line arguments.

### Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to modify the way the key-value pairs are constructed in the command list. Instead of adding quotes around the entire key-value pair, we should concatenate the key, equals sign, and value directly without quotes.

### Corrected Version
```python
class SparkSubmitTask(luigi.Task):
    def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
        command = []
        if value and isinstance(value, dict):
            for prop, val in value.items():
                command += [name, '{0}={1}'.format(prop, val)]
        return command
```

With this corrected version, the function should now correctly construct the command list with key-value pairs in the expected format for command line arguments.
