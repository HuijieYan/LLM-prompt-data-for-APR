The bug in the `_dict_arg` function arises from incorrectly formatting the key-value pairs in the command list when iterating over the dictionary. The double quotes around the key-value pairs are causing the issue.

To fix the bug, we need to remove the double quotes around the key-value pairs in the command list.

Here is the corrected version of the `_dict_arg` function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, '{0}={1}'.format(prop, val)]
    return command
```

With this correction, the function will now properly format the key-value pairs without unnecessary double quotes, satisfying the expected input/output values provided.
