### Analysis
The buggy function `_dict_arg` is intended to create a command list based on the input dictionary `value`. However, the bug lies in how the key-value pairs are formatted in the command list. The current implementation adds unnecessary double quotes around the key-value pairs, causing the actual command to be incorrect.

### Bug Cause
The bug is caused by the implementation of the loop that constructs the command list. The line `command += [name, '"{0}={1}"'.format(prop, value)]` adds the key-value pair to the command list with unnecessary double quotes, resulting in incorrect formatting.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to remove the double quotes around the key-value pairs while constructing the command list. This can be achieved by directly formatting the key-value pairs without the quotes.

### Corrected Version
```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, "{0}={1}".format(prop, val)]
    return command
```

By using `{0}={1}` in the formatting, we ensure that the key-value pairs are added to the command list without unnecessary quotes. This corrected version should now correctly construct the command list as expected.
