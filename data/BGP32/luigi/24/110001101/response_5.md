### Analysis
The buggy function `_dict_arg` is intended to handle dictionary input and convert it into a list of commands for SparkSubmitTask. However, the current implementation is adding unnecessary quotes around the key-value pairs, causing the output to be incorrect.

### Bug explanation
The bug lies in the line where the key-value pairs are formatted with unnecessary quotes: `command += [name, '"{0}={1}"'.format(prop, value)]`. This results in the key-value pairs being enclosed within double quotes in the final command list.

### Bug fix strategy
To fix the bug, we need to remove the unnecessary quotes around the key-value pairs before adding them to the `command` list.

### Corrected version of the buggy function
```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, '{0}={1}'.format(prop, val)]
    return command
```

### Expected corrected output
The corrected version of the function should generate the expected command list without unnecessary quotes. It should satisfy the expected input/output values provided for the failing test cases.
