The cause of the bug is that the buggy function is incorrectly adding double quotes around the property-value pairs when constructing the command list. This results in the command list containing extra quotes, which are not expected in the output.

To fix the bug, we need to remove the double quotes around the property-value pairs in the format string inside the list comprehension.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, '{0}={1}'.format(prop, val)]
    return command
```

By removing the unnecessary double quotes in the format string, the function will construct the command list correctly without additional quotes around the property-value pairs. This will align with the expected output values for the given test cases.
