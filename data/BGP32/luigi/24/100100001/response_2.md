Potential Error:
- The bug in the `_dict_arg` function lies in the way the command list is constructed. The function is using the same variable `value` for the outer loop and inner loop, leading to incorrect results.

Cause of the bug:
- The bug is caused by reusing the variable name `value` for both the outer loop and inner loop. This leads to a conflict in the values and incorrect formatting of the command list.

Strategy for fixing the bug:
- To fix the bug, we need to use different variable names for the outer loop (e.g., `prop`) and inner loop (e.g., `inner_value`) to avoid conflicts and ensure proper construction of the command list.

Corrected Version of the function `_dict_arg`:
```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, inner_value in value.items():
            command += [name, '"{0}={1}"'.format(prop, inner_value)]
    return command
```

After applying this correction, the `_dict_arg` function should work correctly and pass the provided failing test.
