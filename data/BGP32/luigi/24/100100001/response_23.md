## Analysis:
The `_dict_arg` function is expected to convert a dictionary into a list of command line arguments in the form of key=value pairs. The buggy code is not correctly formatting the arguments and is causing the test cases to fail.

## Errors:
1. The current code uses the same variable `value` for both the input dictionary and the inner loop, leading to overwriting and incorrect formatting of values.
2. The format string `"'{0}={1}'"` is not accurately generating key=value pairs.

## Bug Explanation:
The bug arises from the incorrect generation of command line arguments within the `_dict_arg` function. Due to improper formatting of key=value pairs and the reassignment of the variable `value` within the loop, the resulting command list is not correctly structured, leading to test failures.

## Fix Strategy:
1. Rename one of the variables to avoid overwriting.
2. Correct the format string to accurately generate key=value pairs.

## Corrected Version:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, '--{0}={1}'.format(prop, val)]
    return command
``` 

By making the changes suggested above, the function should correctly format the arguments, leading to the passing of the failing tests.
