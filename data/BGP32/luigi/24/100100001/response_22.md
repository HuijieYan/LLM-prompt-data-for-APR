### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_dict_arg` is designed to take a name and a dictionary as arguments, iterate through the dictionary, and create a list of command arguments based on the key-value pairs.
2. The potential error locations in the function could be related to how the values are being formatted and appended to the `command` list.

### Cause of the Bug:
The bug in the `_dict_arg` function is caused by the incorrect formatting of the key-value pairs from the dictionary when constructing the command list. The current implementation adds unnecessary quotes around the values of the key-value pairs, which leads to mismatched values in the final command list.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to modify how the key-value pairs are formatted and appended to the command list. By removing the unnecessary quotes around the values, we can ensure that the key-value pairs are correctly represented in the final command.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, '{0}={1}'.format(prop, val)]
    return command
```

By correcting the function to remove the unnecessary quotes around the values, we can ensure that the key-value pairs are formatted correctly in the command list.

This corrected version of the `_dict_arg` function should now pass the failing test cases provided.
