The bug in the `_dict_arg` function is that the function is overwriting the `value` parameter in the loop, causing unexpected behavior and incorrect command generation. This is because both the loop variable `value` and the input parameter `value` have the same name, leading to confusion and errors.

To fix this bug, we need to use a different variable name in the loop to avoid overwriting the input parameter `value`. 

Here is the corrected version of the `_dict_arg` function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, '"{0}={1}"'.format(prop, val)]
    return command
```

By using `val` as the loop variable instead of `value`, we prevent overwriting the input parameter `value` and ensure correct command generation.

This corrected version of the `_dict_arg` function should now pass the failing test in `test_defaults` as it correctly generates the command list based on the input dictionary values.
