### Analysis:
- The `_dict_arg` function is supposed to convert a dictionary `value` into a list `command` containing key-value pairs in a specific format.
- The function loops through the dictionary `value` and appends key-value pairs to the `command` list.
- The issue is happening when constructing the key-value pairs in the `command` list.

### Identified Bug:
The bug lies in how the key-value pairs are being formatted and added to the `command` list in the `_dict_arg` function. The current implementation is adding a single string for each key-value pair in the format `"{0}={1}"`. This results in incorrect formatting when passed to the test cases.

### Cause of the Bug:
The bug in the `_dict_arg` function arises because each key-value pair is being enclosed in quotes which is not necessary. This leads to the failure of the test cases due to the incorrect formatting of the command list.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to modify the way key-value pairs are formatted in the `command` list. Instead of enclosing each key-value pair in quotes, we should format them as `prop=value` without quotes.

### Corrected Version of the `_dict_arg` Function:
```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, "{0}={1}".format(prop, val)]
    return command
```

With this corrected version, the key-value pairs will be properly formatted in the `command` list without unnecessary quotes. This should fix the bug and ensure that the test cases pass successfully.
