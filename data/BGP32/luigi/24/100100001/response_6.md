The bug in the `_dict_arg` function lies in the reassignment of `value` in the loop which overwrites the original value passed to the function. The value should be stored in a separate variable to avoid this issue.

Here is a corrected version of the `_dict_arg` function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, '"{0}={1}"'.format(prop, val)]
    return command

```

By storing the inner loop variable in a different variable `val`, it prevents the overwriting of the original `value`. This corrected version should now pass the failing test as it correctly formats the key-value pairs in the command list.
