### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_dict_arg` is supposed to iterate over key-value pairs in a dictionary and generate a command list based on the key-value pairs.
2. The problem lies in the fact that the variable `value` is being used both as the input argument and as the loop variable, causing incorrect values to be appended to the `command` list.

### Cause of Bug:
1. The bug arises due to reusing the variable `value` in the `for` loop. The outer `value` argument should not be modified.  
2. When the loop starts running, the value of the outer `value` is being updated by the inner `value` loop variable, resulting in incorrect command generation.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
1. To fix the bug, we need to ensure that we are not using the same variable name for both the loop variable and the function input.
2. The loop variable should be distinct from the input argument variable.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():  # Using 'val' as the loop variable
            command += [name, '"{0}={1}"'.format(prop, val)]  # Appending key-value pairs to the command list
    return command
```

### Explanation:
By updating the loop variable to be `val` instead of `value`, we prevent the modification of the original `value` argument. This correction ensures that the command list is correctly populated with the key-value pairs from the input dictionary.

By making this change, the corrected function should now correctly generate the command list based on the dictionary input, passing the failing test case.
