The issue in the `_dict_arg` function lies in the key-value pair formatting within the command list. The current implementation is using double quotes around the key-value pairs, which is incorrect and causing the test to fail.

To fix the bug, we need to remove the double quotes around the formatted key-value pairs in the command list.

Here is the corrected version of the `_dict_arg` function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, "{0}={1}".format(prop, val)]
    return command
```

This updated version will correctly format the key-value pairs without the unnecessary double quotes, which should allow the failing test to pass.
