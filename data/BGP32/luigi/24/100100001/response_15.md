### Analysis:
1. The `_dict_arg` function is designed to accept a name and value and create a command list based on the value (assuming it is a dictionary).
2. The function iterates through the key-value pairs of the dictionary and constructs command parts accordingly.
3. The current implementation of the function is incorrect because it is modifying the `value` variable inside the loop, which causes issues when adding to the `command` list.
4. As a result, the function is not correctly constructing the command list as intended.

### Bug Cause:
The bug in the `_dict_arg` function arises from reusing the variable `value` for the loop iteration as well as the unpacked values. This leads to incorrect construction of the command list, causing the test cases to fail.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we should avoid reusing the `value` variable in the loop. Instead, it is better to use separate variables for iteration and unpacking the dictionary items. This will ensure that the `command` list is constructed correctly based on the input dictionary.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():  # Use a different variable name (val) for iterating over the dictionary
            command += [name, '"{0}={1}"'.format(prop, val)]  # Use the val variable for constructing the command
    return command
```

With this corrected version of the `_dict_arg` function, it should now correctly construct the command list based on the input dictionary and pass the failing test cases.
