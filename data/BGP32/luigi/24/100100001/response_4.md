### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_dict_arg` is supposed to construct a list of command-line arguments using key-value pairs from a dictionary.
2. The bug may lie in how the arguments are being constructed within the `for` loop.
3. The failing test cases reveal issues related to handling command-line arguments like `--py-files`, `--files`, and `--conf`.

### Bug Cause:
The bug causes the `command` list to concatenate incorrectly, resulting in incorrect formatting of the command-line arguments.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
1. Ensure that each argument is properly formatted as `--key=value`.
2. Append each argument correctly to the `command` list.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, '--{0}={1}'.format(prop, val)]
    return command
```

By making these changes, the corrected version of the `_dict_arg` function should now correctly format the command-line arguments based on the given dictionary.
