The bug in the `_dict_arg` function lies in the reusing of the variable name `value` within the loop to iterate over the dictionary items. This causes the original `value` argument to be overwritten and results in an incorrect command list being constructed.

To fix this bug, we need to use a different variable name for the loop iteration. Here is the corrected version of the `_dict_arg` function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():  # Change variable name from value to val
            command += [name, '"{0}={1}"'.format(prop, val)]  # Update variable name here as well
    return command
```

By changing the loop iteration variable name to `val` instead of `value`, we avoid overwriting the original function argument and construct the command list correctly based on the dictionary items.

This corrected version of the `_dict_arg` function should now pass the failing tests provided.
