### Analysis:
The `_dict_arg` function is intended to take a dictionary `value` and convert it into a list of command line arguments, where each key-value pair in the dictionary is formatted as `"key=value"`. However, there is a bug in the function that is causing it to not correctly format the key-value pairs.

### Potential Error Location:
The bug seems to be located in the line:
```python
command += [name, '"{0}={1}"'.format(prop, value)]
```
The value variable here is being used for both the input dictionary and the formatted string, causing a conflict.

### Bug Cause:
The bug causes the function to incorrectly add the key-value pairs to the `command` list, resulting in a list with incorrect formatting of the key-value pairs.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix this bug, we should use different variable names for the key and value in the loop to avoid conflicts. It can be achieved by changing the variable name in the loop from `value` to something else.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
Here is the corrected version of the `_dict_arg` function:
```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, '"{0}={1}"'.format(prop, val)]
    return command
```

With this correction, the key-value pairs from the input dictionary should now be formatted correctly and added to the `command` list. This corrected version should pass the failing test cases provided.
