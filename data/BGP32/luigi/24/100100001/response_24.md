### Analysis:
1. The `_dict_arg` function is designed to convert a dictionary of arguments into a list of command arguments.
2. The function iterates over the dictionary items and formats each property-value pair as a string to be added to the command list.
3. The bug may lie in how the property-value pair is formatted before being added to the command list.

### Bug Explanation:
The bug in the `_dict_arg` function likely arises from the formatting of property-value pairs in the command list. The current implementation adds unnecessary quotes around the property-value pair, causing the command to be incorrectly formatted.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we should update the formatting of the property-value pairs in the command list to remove the unnecessary quotes.

### Corrected Version:
```python
# Corrected version of the _dict_arg function
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():  # Change variable name from `value` to `val`
            command += [name, "{0}={1}".format(prop, val)]  # Remove unnecessary quotes
    return command
```

In the corrected version, we changed the variable name to avoid confusion, removed the unnecessary quotes around the property-value pair, and used correct formatting to ensure the command list is generated correctly.

By using this corrected version, the `_dict_arg` function should now correctly convert the dictionary of arguments into a list of command arguments. This should resolve the bug and make the failing test pass.
