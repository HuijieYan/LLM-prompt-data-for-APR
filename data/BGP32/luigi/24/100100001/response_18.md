After analyzing the provided buggy function `_dict_arg(self, name, value)`, it seems that the issue lies in the list concatenation using the `+=` operator inside the for loop. This operator may not work as expected when trying to append multiple elements to the list in one go.

The cause of the bug in the failing test might be related to the incorrect concatenation of values in the `command` list within the `_dict_arg` function. The function is supposed to create a list of command arguments based on the input dictionary, but the concatenation operation is incorrect, resulting in unexpected behavior when building the command list.

To fix the bug, we should append each command argument individually to the `command` list rather than trying to concatenate multiple elements at once.

Here is the corrected version of the `_dict_arg` function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, prop_value in value.items():
            command.append(name)
            command.append('"{0}={1}"'.format(prop, prop_value))
    return command
```

By appending each command argument separately, we ensure that each key-value pair from the dictionary is correctly added to the `command` list.

This correction should now allow the failing test to pass when using the revised `_dict_arg` function.
