### Analysis:
1. The `_dict_arg` function takes in a name and a dictionary of key-value pairs as arguments.
2. It iterates over the dictionary and forms a list of strings based on the keys and values in the format `"key=value"`.
3. The function returns the list formed.
4. The failing test cases contain key-value pairs that should be converted into strings in the format mentioned above.

### Identified Issue:
The issue in the current implementation is that the function does not handle the case where the value of a key in the dictionary is `None`.

### Bug Cause:
When the value of a key in the dictionary is `None`, the condition `if value and isinstance(value, dict):` still evaluates to `True`, which leads to unexpected behavior when forming the command list.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
1. Check if the value is not `None` and is an instance of a dictionary in the `if` condition.
2. If the value is `None`, skip that key-value pair while forming the command list.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value is not None and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            if val is not None:
                command.append(name)
                command.append('"{0}={1}"'.format(prop, val))
    return command
```

By checking for `None` values before adding to the command list, we ensure that only valid key-value pairs contribute to the final command list.
