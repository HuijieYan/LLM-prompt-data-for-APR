The issue in the `_dict_arg` function is with the variable names conflicting in the loop. The bug is that the loop variable name `value` is being redefined within the loop, leading to unexpected behavior.

Here is the corrected version of the `_dict_arg` function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():  # change variable name from value to val to avoid conflict
            command += [name, '"{0}={1}"'.format(prop, val)]  # use val instead of value
    return command
```

This corrected version should resolve the issue where the loop variable `value` was redefined within the loop, causing the unexpected behavior. With this fix, the function should properly format the command list based on the input dictionary and work correctly with the test cases provided.
