### Analysis:
1. The `_dict_arg` function takes `name` and `value` as arguments and is supposed to construct a command list based on the dictionary `value`.
2. The function iterates over the key-value pairs in the input dictionary and constructs a command list by formatting the key-value pairs.
3. The potential error is within the loop where the `value` variable is being overwritten by the inner loop iteration value. This can lead to unexpected behavior and incorrect command construction.
4. The bug is likely causing the incorrect formatting of the command list, as observed in the failing test output.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is caused by the variable name collision within the loop. When the inner loop iterates over key-value pairs in the `value` dictionary, it updates the `value` variable which causes the incorrect construction of the command list.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, it's necessary to use a different variable name for the inner loop iteration in order to avoid overwriting the original `value` variable. This way, the command list will be constructed correctly without interference from the inner loop.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():  # Use a different variable name 'val'
            command += [name, '"{0}={1}"'.format(prop, val)]  # Use 'val' instead of 'value'
    return command
```

By making this change, the corrected version of the `_dict_arg` function should now properly construct the command list based on the input dictionary without any variable name collisions. This should enable the function to pass the failing test case.
