### Analysis:
The `_dict_arg` function is supposed to convert a dictionary of arguments into a list of command-line arguments. However, the bug is in the way the function is building the command list. It is using the same variable `value` for both the dictionary items and the actual value, causing conflicts and incorrect formatting.

### Error Location:
The error is in the loop where the function iterates over the items in the dictionary. By using the same variable name `value` for both the property and the value, it results in incorrect command building.

### Cause of the Bug:
The bug is caused by reusing the variable `value` for both the property and value within the loop. This results in incorrect formatting of the command list.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
1. Use distinct variable names for the property and the value within the loop.
2. Properly format the command list with the property and its corresponding value.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():  # Changed 'value' to 'val' to avoid conflict
            command += [name, '"{0}={1}"'.format(prop, val)]  # Use 'val' for the value
    return command
```

Applying these changes will fix the bug and correctly format the command list.
