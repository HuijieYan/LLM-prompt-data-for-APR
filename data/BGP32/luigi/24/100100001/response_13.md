### Analysis:
The buggy function `_dict_arg` is intended to prepare a list of arguments based on a dictionary of key-value pairs. However, there is an issue with how the arguments are being appended to the `command` list. The function incorrectly concatenates the key-value pairs with equals sign enclosed in double-quotes.

### Identified Bug:
The bug in the `_dict_arg` function is that it wraps the individual key-value pairs in double-quotes, which can cause issues when constructing the final list of command arguments in certain scenarios.

### Explanation of the Bug:
The bug causes the values in the key-value pairs to be enclosed in double-quotes, which is not required for command line arguments. This incorrect formatting of the arguments results in a mismatch between the expected and actual list of arguments.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to modify the function to correctly construct the command list using the key-value pairs without wrapping the values in double-quotes.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, prop_value in value.items():
            command += [name, "{0}={1}".format(prop, prop_value)]
    return command
```

With this correction, the key and its corresponding value will be concatenated using equals sign without unnecessary double-quotes.

By making this change, the function should now prepare the command list correctly and align with the expectations in the test cases.
