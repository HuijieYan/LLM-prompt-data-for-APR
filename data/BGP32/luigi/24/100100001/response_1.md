### Analysis:
The buggy function `_dict_arg` is intended to process a dictionary and convert it into a list of command arguments. However, in the current implementation, there is a variable name conflict between the loop iteration variable `value` and the function argument `value`, leading to unexpected behavior.

### Identifying potential errors:
1. The `value` variable is being overwritten within the loop, causing unexpected behavior.
2. The string formatting used in the line `command += [name, '"{0}={1}"'.format(prop, value)]` may not generate the desired command argument.

### Explanation of the bug:
The bug arises because the loop variable `value` overwrites the function argument `value`, resulting in unexpected behavior in constructing the command list.

### Strategy for fixing the bug:
To fix the bug, we need to use a different variable name in the `for` loop to avoid shadowing the function argument. Additionally, the string formatting should be fixed to produce the correct command arguments.

### Corrected version of the function `_dict_arg`:
```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():  # Use a different variable name to avoid shadowing
            command += [name, '{0}={1}'.format(prop, val)]  # Correct the string formatting
    return command
```

By making the above corrections, the function `_dict_arg` should now correctly process the dictionary input and generate the desired list of command arguments. This updated version should pass the failing test provided.
