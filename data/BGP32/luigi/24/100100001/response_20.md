The issue in the `_dict_arg` function arises from reusing the variable name `value` for both the parameter and the nested variable. This causes the original `value` parameter to be overwritten, leading to an incorrect command construction.

To fix this bug, we should use a different variable name for the nested loop's value to avoid overwriting the original `value` from the function parameter.

Here is the corrected version of the `_dict_arg` function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, prop_value in value.items():  # Change the variable name here
            command += [name, '"{0}={1}"'.format(prop, prop_value)]
    return command
```

With this modification, the function should now correctly construct the command list based on the input dictionary without overwriting the original `value` parameter.

This corrected version should pass the failing test provided.
