### Analysis:
The `_dict_arg` function seems to be attempting to convert a dictionary into a list of command arguments in key-value format. However, the bug lies in the way the command arguments are being constructed within the function. The use of `value` as both the input parameter and loop variable is causing issues in storing the key-value pairs in the `command` list.

### Error Locations:
1. Keeping the loop variable as `value` is overwriting the input dictionary `value`.
2. The concatenation of strings within the `'{}="{}={}"'.format(prop, value)` statement might not be needed.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is caused by the misuse of variable names in the loop within the `_dict_arg` function. By using the same variable `value` for the loop iteration inside the dictionary comprehension, the original `value` passed to the function is getting overwritten, leading to incorrect command construction.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Use different variable names within the loop to store the key and value separately from the input dictionary.
2. Improve the format of key-value pairs being added to the `command` list.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
# The corrected version of the buggy function

def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():  # use 'val' instead of 'value' within the loop
            command += [name, '--{0}={1}'.format(prop, val)]  # improve the format for key-value pairs
    return command
```

By making these changes in the function, the corrected version should now construct the command list correctly with the key-value pairs from the input dictionary.

Now, the corrected function should be able to pass the failing tests provided above.
