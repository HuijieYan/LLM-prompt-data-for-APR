The bug in the `_dict_arg` function is that it overwrites the `value` variable used in the loop with the inner loop's value. This leads to incorrect command construction.

To fix this bug, we should use a different variable name for the inner loop value to avoid overwriting the outer loop variable. Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, prop_value in value.items():
            command += [name, f'"{prop}={prop_value}"']
    return command
```

By using `prop_value` instead of `value` in the inner loop, we avoid the variable shadowing issue that was causing the bug. This corrected version should pass the failing test cases provided.
