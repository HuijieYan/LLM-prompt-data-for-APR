## Analysis:
The `_dict_arg` function is supposed to generate a list of arguments based on a dictionary of key-value pairs passed as input. However, the bug in the function lies in how the arguments are being concatenated to the `command` list. The current implementation is using the same variable name `value` to iterate over the dictionary and store the formatted string representation of the key-value pair.

## Bug:
The bug is caused by the reassignment of the variable `value` within the for loop, which overrides the original input value. This results in incorrect argument formation, as the loop variable is used for both iterating over the dictionary and storing the formatted string, leading to missing arguments and incorrect formatting.

## Fix:
To fix the bug, we need to use a different variable name to store the formatted argument string, while maintaining the original value of the key-value pair. This can be achieved by using a different variable name for the formatted argument in the for loop.

## Corrected Version:
```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, prop_val in value.items():
            command += [name, '"{0}={1}"'.format(prop, prop_val)]
    return command
``` 

By using `prop_val` to store the formatted argument string within the loop, we ensure that the original `value` is retained for iterating over the dictionary.
