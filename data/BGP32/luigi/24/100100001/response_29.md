The issue in the `_dict_arg` function is that it is overwriting the `value` variable while iterating through the dictionary. This causes the function to only return the last key-value pair in the dictionary. To fix this, a different variable should be used for the inner loop. Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():  # Use a different variable name for the inner loop
            command += [name, '"{0}={1}"'.format(prop, val)]
    return command
```

By using a separate variable `val` in the inner loop, each key-value pair will be correctly added to the `command` list.

With this correction in place, the function should now correctly generate the command list based on the input dictionary. This will ensure that the correct command list is generated in the test functions provided and will address the bug where only the last key-value pair was being added to the command list.
