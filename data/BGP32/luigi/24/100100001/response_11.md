### Analysis:
1. The `_dict_arg` function is designed to convert a dictionary into a list of command line arguments.
2. The function iterates over the key-value pairs in the dictionary and constructs a list of strings where each string represents a key-value pair in the format `"{key}={value}"`.
3. The bug in the function seems to be related to the reassignment of the loop variable `value` inside the loop.
4. The failing test cases are related to constructing command arguments for a Spark job, and the `--conf` option is one of the arguments being processed by the `_dict_arg` function.

### Bug Explanation:
The bug in the provided function is due to the variable `value` being reused in both the loop header and inside the loop to construct the command. This causes the original value of `value` to be overwritten during the loop iteration, leading to incorrect command construction.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to change the loop variable name inside the loop so that it does not conflict with the name of the outer argument. This will ensure that the original value passed to the function is not modified during the loop iteration.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():  # Corrected loop variable name 'val'
            command += [name, '"{0}={1}"'.format(prop, val)]  # Use 'val' to construct the command
    return command
```

By correcting the loop variable name to `val` inside the loop, we can prevent the original `value` from being overwritten and ensure correct construction of the command list.
