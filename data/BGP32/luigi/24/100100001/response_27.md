The issue in the `_dict_arg` function lies in the re-assignment of the variable `value` within the for loop when iterating over the dictionary items. This causes the original `value` parameter to be overwritten, leading to incorrect command generation.

To fix this bug, we should use a different variable name for the value in the for loop to avoid overwriting the original `value` parameter. Here is the corrected version of the `_dict_arg` function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, '"{0}={1}"'.format(prop, val)]
    return command
```

By using `val` instead of `value` inside the loop, we ensure that the original `value` remains unchanged and the correct command is generated based on the dictionary items.
