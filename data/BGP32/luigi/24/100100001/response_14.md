## Analysis:
1. The `_dict_arg` function is designed to convert a dictionary into a list of command-line arguments formatted as strings.
2. The function iterates over the key-value pairs in the input dictionary and appends them to the command list after formatting them.
3. The bug in the function lies in the fact that it reuses the variable name `value` both as the input parameter and the counter variable in the loop, leading to a conflict.

## Bug Explanation:
The bug occurs because the variable `value` is reused for different purposes within the function. When the loop runs, the loop counter `value` overrides the input parameter `value`. This results in the incorrect conversion of key-value pairs into command arguments.

## Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to differentiate between the input parameter `value` and the loop counter variable. This can be achieved by renaming the loop counter to something different, such as `val`, to avoid conflicts with the input value.

## Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, '"{0}={1}"'.format(prop, val)]
    return command
```

By renaming the loop counter variable to `val`, we prevent conflicts with the input parameter `value` and ensure that key-value pairs are correctly converted into command-line arguments.
