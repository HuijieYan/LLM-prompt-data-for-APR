### Analysis
1. The `_dict_arg` function is intended to convert a dictionary into a list of command line arguments.
2. The function iterates over the dictionary items, constructs a string for each key-value pair, and appends it to the `command` list.
3. The bug seems to be related to the incorrect formatting of key-value pairs as strings in the resulting command list.

### Bug Cause
The bug occurs due to the method of formatting key-value pairs within the command list. The current implementation wraps the values in double quotes, causing a mismatch with the expected format in the test cases.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we should remove the double quotes surrounding the values in the resulting command list to match the expected format. This can be achieved by directly concatenating the key-value pairs without the quotes.

### Corrected Version of the Function
```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, '{0}={1}'.format(prop, val)]
    return command
```

By correcting the formatting of the key-value pairs in the command list, the function should now pass the failing test cases and produce the expected output.
