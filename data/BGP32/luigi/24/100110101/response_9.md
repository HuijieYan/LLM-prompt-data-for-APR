The bug in the `_dict_arg` function is caused by incorrectly formatting the key-value pairs from the input dictionary into the command list. The function is currently wrapping the values in double quotes unnecessarily, leading to a mismatch in the expected and actual output during the test execution.

To fix this bug, we need to remove the unnecessary double quotes when formatting the key-value pairs in the command list.

Here is the corrected version of the `_dict_arg` function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, '{0}={1}'.format(prop, val)]
    return command
```

By removing the double quotes around the formatted key-value pairs, the function should now correctly generate the command list as expected. This corrected version should pass the failing tests with the provided inputs and expected outputs.
