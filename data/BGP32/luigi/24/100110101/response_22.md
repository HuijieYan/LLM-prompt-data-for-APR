The issue in the provided `_dict_arg` function is that it incorrectly adds double quotes around the value when constructing the command list. This leads to a mismatch with the expected command list in the test cases.

The fix for the bug is to remove the double quotes around the value while constructing the command list. Here is the corrected version of the `_dict_arg` function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, '{0}={1}'.format(prop, val)]
    return command
```

By making this change, the function should now correctly construct the command list without the unnecessary double quotes, ensuring that it matches the expected command list in the test cases.

This corrected version should now pass the failing test cases with the expected input/output values provided.
