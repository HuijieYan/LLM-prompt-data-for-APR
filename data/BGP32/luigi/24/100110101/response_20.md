### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_dict_arg` is designed to format a dictionary into command arguments by iterating over key-value pairs.
2. The bug seems to be related to how the function formats the key-value pair of the dictionary.
3. The first failing test shows that the function is wrapping the value with double quotes, causing a mismatch with the expected command list. The second failing test also indicates a similar issue with wrapping the value with double quotes.
4. To fix the bug, we need to modify the way the function formats the key-value pairs from the dictionary.
5. The corrected version of the function is provided below:

### Corrected Version:
```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: luigi/contrib/spark.py

def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, '{0}={1}'.format(prop, val)]
    return command
```

In the corrected version:
- We iterate over the key-value pairs in the dictionary and directly concatenate the key and value without wrapping the value with double quotes.
- This modification should resolve the formatting issue and align the command list with the expected values in the test cases.
