### Analysis
The buggy function `_dict_arg` is supposed to generate a command list based on the input dictionary `value` and the `name` parameter. However, there are two issues causing the failing tests:
1. The buggy function is wrapping the `value` with double quotes when formatting the command list. This leads to a mismatch in the expected and actual command list.
2. There is a mismatch in the handling of dictionary values for the command list.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to remove the unnecessary double quotes around the `value` when formatting the command list. Additionally, we need to ensure that the dictionary values are added correctly to the command list.

### Corrected Function
```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, '{0}={1}'.format(prop, val)]
    return command
```

By correcting the function as described, the issues regarding the unnecessary double quotes and the proper handling of dictionary values when generating the command list are addressed. This corrected function should pass the failing tests and satisfy the expected input/output values.
