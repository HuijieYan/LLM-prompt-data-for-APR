The bug in the `_dict_arg` function lies in the way it constructs the command list. It is incorrectly adding quotation marks around the property=value pairs, leading to a mismatch in the test cases. To fix this bug, we need to remove the unnecessary quotation marks around the property=value pairs.

Here is the corrected version of the `_dict_arg` function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, '{0}={1}'.format(prop, val)]
    return command
```

By removing the quotation marks around the property=value pairs, the function now correctly constructs the command list. This change will ensure that the function passes the failing test cases provided.
