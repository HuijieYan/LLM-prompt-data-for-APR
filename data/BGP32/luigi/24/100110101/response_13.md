### Analysis:
The buggy function `_dict_arg` is designed to take a dictionary as input and return a list of command-line arguments. The issue arises from the way the function constructs the command list when iterating over the key-value pairs of the input dictionary. The function wrongly adds double quotes around the property=value pairs, leading to discrepancies in the test cases.

### Bug Cause:
1. The bug arises from the line `command += [name, '"{0}={1}"'.format(prop, value)]`, where double quotes are added around the value (`{0}={1}`).
2. In the failing tests, the values in the expected output lists are without double quotes, causing the assertion errors.

### Bug Fix:
To fix the bug, we need to modify the way the function constructs the command list. We should remove the double quotes while formatting the property-value pairs.

### Corrected Code:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, '{0}={1}'.format(prop, val)]
    return command
```

By removing the double quotes around `"{0}={1}"`, the corrected function should now properly format the property-value pairs without any extra characters. This correction should make the function produce the expected output, resolving the assertion errors in the test cases.
