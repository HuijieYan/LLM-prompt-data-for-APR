### Analysis:
The `_dict_arg` function is designed to create a list of command arguments based on a dictionary input. The bug seems to be related to the formatting of key-value pairs within the command list.

### Bug Explanation:
The bug is caused by the current implementation of the `_dict_arg` function. When formatting the key-value pairs within the command list, the function is adding unnecessary double quotes around the values. This results in a mismatch when comparing the expected command list with the actual command list in the test cases.

### Bug Fix:
To fix the bug, we need to remove the double quotes around the values when constructing the command list.

### Corrected Function:
```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, '{0}={1}'.format(prop, val)]
    return command
``` 

By modifying the `_dict_arg` function as shown above, the double quotes around the values are removed, which should resolve the bug and make the function return the correct command list.
