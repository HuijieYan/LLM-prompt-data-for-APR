### Analysis:
1. The `_dict_arg` function is supposed to take a dictionary `value` and generate a list of command line arguments based on the key-value pairs in the dictionary.
2. The bug seems to be related to the way the key-value pairs are formatted in the generated command list. The buggy code is incorrectly wrapping the value in double quotes.
3. In the failing tests, the expected command list does not have the values wrapped in double quotes, leading to an assertion error when comparing the expected and actual command lists.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is caused by incorrectly formatting the key-value pairs in the generated command list. The values are wrapped in double quotes unnecessarily, causing a mismatch with the expected format in the failing tests.

### Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to remove the unnecessary double quotes around the values when formatting the key-value pairs in the command list.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, '{0}={1}'.format(prop, val)]
    return command
```

By removing the double quotes around `{1}` in the `format` method, the corrected version should generate the command list without unnecessary quotes, aligning with the expected values in the failing tests.
