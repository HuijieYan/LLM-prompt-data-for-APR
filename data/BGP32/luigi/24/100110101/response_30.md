### Analysis:
1. The `_dict_arg` function is supposed to generate a list of command arguments based on a dictionary input.
2. The bug seems to be caused by the formatting of the command list, where the value in the dictionary is formatted within double quotes when it should not be in some cases.
3. The failing tests show that the generated command list includes unnecessary double quotes around some values causing the assertion errors.
4. To fix the bug, we should adjust the formatting of the values in the command list based on the type of value.
5. The correction should handle cases where the value is a string without quotes and where the value is a list, separating the elements within the list accordingly.

### Correction:
```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, value in value.items():
            if isinstance(value, str):
                if "=" in value:  # Check if the value already contains "="
                    command += [name, "{0}={1}".format(prop, value)]
                else:
                    command += [name, "--{0}".format(prop), str(value)]
            elif isinstance(value, list):
                command += [name, "--{0}".format(prop)] + [v for v in value if v]  # Filter out empty values
            
    return command
```

This corrected version of the `_dict_arg` function should handle both cases where the value is a string or a list appropriately, generating the command list without unnecessary double quotes.
