The bug in the `_dict_arg` function arises from the incorrect formatting of key-value pairs in the command list. The function mistakenly adds double quotes around the values of the dictionary items, leading to a mismatch with the expected output in the test cases.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the function to construct the command list without adding extra quotes around the property values.

Here is the corrected version of the `_dict_arg` function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, '{0}={1}'.format(prop, val)]
    return command
```

This corrected version removes the unnecessary double quotes around the property values in the command list, aligning it with the expected output in the test cases.

The updated function should now pass the failing test cases and produce the expected output.
