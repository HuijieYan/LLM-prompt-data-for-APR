Based on the provided information, the bug in the `_dict_arg` function seems to be related to how the dictionary values are processed and formatted. The bug is causing the function to create command arguments incorrectly, leading to assertion errors in the test cases.

The cause of the bug is that the function incorrectly handles dictionary values when constructing the command list. Instead of adding the values directly, it is enclosing them in double quotes along with the key. This is not necessary and leads to a mismatch with the expected values in the tests.

To fix the bug, we need to update the function to correctly construct the command list by adding the key and value separately without unnecessary quotation marks.

Here's the corrected version of the `_dict_arg` function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, prop_value in value.items():
            command += [name, prop + '=' + prop_value]
    return command
```

By making this change, the function should now correctly handle dictionary values and construct the command list without unnecessary quotation marks.

This corrected version should pass the failing tests and satisfy the expected input/output values provided.
