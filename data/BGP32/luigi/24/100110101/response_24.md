The bug in the `_dict_arg` function is caused by incorrectly formatting the dictionary values when constructing the command list. The function mistakenly adds quotes around the property values in the command list, leading to a mismatch between the expected and actual values in the test cases.

To fix the bug, we need to remove the quotes around the property values before adding them to the command list.

Here is the corrected version of the `_dict_arg` function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, '{0}={1}'.format(prop, val)]
    return command
```

By making this change, the function will correctly format the dictionary values without unnecessary quotes, ensuring that the test cases pass as expected.
