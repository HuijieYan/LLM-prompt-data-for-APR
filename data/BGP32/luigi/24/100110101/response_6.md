### Analysis:
The buggy function `_dict_arg` is intended to convert a dictionary `value` to a list `command` with format `name key=value`. However, the current implementation incorrectly adds extra double quotes around the value when constructing the command list. This leads to a mismatch when comparing the expected output with the actual output in the test cases.

### Bug:
The bug in the `_dict_arg` function is that it adds extra double quotes around the value when constructing the command list. This behavior causes the values to be formatted incorrectly and results in failing test cases.

### Fix:
To fix the bug, we need to remove the extra double quotes around the value while constructing the command list in the `_dict_arg` function.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, '{0}={1}'.format(prop, val)]
    return command
```

By making this change, the function will correctly format the command list without extra double quotes around the values, which should resolve the failing test cases and align with the expected input/output values specified.
