### Analysis:
The buggy function `_dict_arg` is designed to take a dictionary as input, iterate over its key-value pairs, and construct a command list based on the key-value pairs. The bug in this function lies in the formatting of the key-value pairs within the command list.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is caused by incorrectly formatting the key-value pairs in the command list. The buggy function adds quotes around the value in the format `"prop=value"`, leading to a mismatch with the expected format `prop=value` when constructing the command list.

### Bug Fix:
To fix the bug, we need to remove the unnecessary quotes around the value while constructing the command list in the `_dict_arg` function.

### Corrected Function:
```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, '{0}={1}'.format(prop, val)]
    return command
```

By making this change, the corrected function will construct the command list without adding quotes around the value, which aligns with the expected format in the failing tests.
