The bug in the `_dict_arg` function is caused by incorrectly formatting the key-value pairs from the input dictionary. The function is adding unnecessary double quotes around the property values, which results in a mismatch when comparing the expected and actual command lists in the test functions.

To fix the bug, we need to remove the double quotes from the generated command list for key-value pairs.

Here is the corrected version of the `_dict_arg` function:

```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: luigi/contrib/spark.py

# Corrected version of the buggy function
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, '{0}={1}'.format(prop, val)]
    return command
```

By removing the unnecessary double quotes from the generated command list, the function now correctly formats key-value pairs from the input dictionary.

This corrected version should now pass the failing test cases and return the expected values.
