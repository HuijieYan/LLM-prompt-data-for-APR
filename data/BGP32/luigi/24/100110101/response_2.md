The issue in the provided `_dict_arg` function is that it is incorrectly appending the key-value pairs from the input dictionary to the `command` list. The bug lies in the way the key-value pairs are being concatenated.

The function is currently wrapping the values in double quotes and then appending them to the list. This is causing a discrepancy when comparing the expected list of values and the actual list of values in the failing test cases.

To resolve this issue, we need to modify the way the key-value pairs are formatted before appending them to the `command` list.

Here is the corrected version of the `_dict_arg` function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, '{0}={1}'.format(prop, val)]
    return command
```

This corrected version formats the key-value pairs using `{0}={1}` without wrapping the value in double quotes.

With this correction, the function should now correctly assemble the command list with the key-value pairs without any additional characters, resolving the failing test cases.
