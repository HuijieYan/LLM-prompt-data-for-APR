### Analysis
The buggy function `_dict_arg` is meant to convert a dictionary parameter into a list to be used in a command. The issue lies in how the key-value pairs from the dictionary are handled. Currently, the function incorrectly adds double quotes around the key-value pairs, leading to a mismatch with the expected command list in the test functions.

### Bug
The bug occurs because the function adds double quotes around the key-value pairs in the command list, while the test cases expect the key-value pairs to be without quotes. This causes a mismatch in the comparison.

### Fix
To fix the bug, we need to remove the quotes around the key-value pairs in the command list before adding them. This will align the function's behavior with the expectations of the test cases.

### Corrected Code
```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, '{0}={1}'.format(prop, val)]
    return command
``` 

By removing the double quotes around the key-value pairs, the corrected function aligns with the expected output in the test cases.
