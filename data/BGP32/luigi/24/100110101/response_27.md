### Analysis:
The buggy function `_dict_arg` is intended to convert a dictionary input into a list of command arguments. The issue seems to be related to the formatting of key-value pairs within the resulting command list.

### Bug:
The bug arises from the fact that the buggy function includes quotes around the value part of each key-value pair when constructing the command list. This results in discrepancies when comparing the expected command list with the actual command list in the test cases, causing the test to fail due to the mismatched quotes.

### Fix:
To fix the bug, we need to remove the quotes around the value part of the key-value pairs when constructing the command list. This will ensure that the resulting command list matches the expected format without additional quotation marks.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, '{0}={1}'.format(prop, val)]
    return command
```

By removing the quotes around `"{0}={1}".format(prop, value)` and using `"{0}={1}".format(prop, val)` instead, the corrected version of the function should now properly format the command list without unnecessary quotation marks. This should resolve the discrepancies seen in the failing test cases.
