### Analysis
The buggy function `_dict_arg` takes a name and a dictionary as input and constructs a list of command arguments based on the dictionary key-value pairs. The bug seems to be related to incorrectly formatting the key-value pairs when constructing the command list.

The failing tests provide input dictionaries with key-value pairs that should be properly formatted in the command list. The error messages indicate that the formatting is incorrect, causing assertion failures in the test cases.

The bug arises from formatting the key-value pairs as `"{key}={value}"` which includes quotes around both key and value, leading to mismatches in the test assertions.

### Bug Cause
The bug in the `_dict_arg` function is caused by adding unnecessary quotes around the key-value pairs when constructing the command list. This incorrect formatting causes the test cases to fail when comparing expected and actual command lists.

### Bug Fix
To fix the bug, we need to remove the quotation marks surrounding the key and value when constructing the command list from the dictionary. This will ensure that the command list matches the expected format without additional quotations.

Let's correct the `_dict_arg` function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, '{0}={1}'.format(prop, val)]
    return command
```

With this correction, the function should properly construct the command list without unnecessary quotes, resolving the assertion failures in the failing test cases.
