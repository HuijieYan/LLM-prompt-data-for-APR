The bug in the `_dict_arg` function is caused by incorrectly handling the dictionary values and not handling quotes around the property values. This leads to an inconsistency in the output format, resulting in the failing tests.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the property values are not enclosed in quotes and the correct format is maintained for the command list.

Here is the corrected version of the `_dict_arg` function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, '{0}={1}'.format(prop, val)]
    return command
```

By making this change, the function should now correctly format the command list with the property values without quotes, resolving the failing tests.
