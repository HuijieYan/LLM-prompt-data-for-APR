**Bug Explanation:**

The bug in the `_dict_arg` function is due to the incorrect handling of dictionary values. The function is supposed to iterate over the key-value pairs in the dictionary and format them correctly before adding them to the `command` list. However, in the buggy implementation, the function incorrectly wraps the values in double-quotes, causing the test cases to fail as the expected values do not match the actual values.

**Bug Fix Strategy:**

1. Remove the unnecessary double-quotes around the values in the dictionary key-value pairs.
2. Update the code to correctly format the key-value pairs and append them to the `command` list.

**Corrected Function:**

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, "{0}={1}".format(prop, val)]
    return command
```

By making the above changes, the function now correctly formats the dictionary key-value pairs without the unnecessary double-quotes, which will ensure that the function works as expected and passes the failing test cases.
