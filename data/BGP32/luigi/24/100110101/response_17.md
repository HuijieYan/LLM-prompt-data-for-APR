The bug in the `_dict_arg` function is that it is incorrectly adding double quotes around the property values when constructing the command list. This results in a mismatch when comparing the expected command list in the test cases.

The fix for this bug is to remove the double quotes when formatting the property and its value in the command list.

Here is the corrected version of the `_dict_arg` function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, '{0}={1}'.format(prop, val)]
    return command
```

By making this change, the function should now construct the command list correctly without adding unnecessary double quotes, aligning it with the expected values in the test cases.
