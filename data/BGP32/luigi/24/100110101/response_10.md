### Analysis:
1. The `_dict_arg` function is supposed to convert a dictionary `value` into a list of strings in the format `name`, `"prop=value"`.
2. The bug is caused by using double quotes around the property value in the output list.
3. When the function encounters a key-value pair in the dictionary, it incorrectly adds the pair with double quotes around the value, which results in a mismatch during comparison with the expected list.
4. To fix the bug, the function should not include double quotes around the property values in the output list.

### Correction:
```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, '{0}={1}'.format(prop, val)]
    return command
``` 

### Explanation:
The corrected function now correctly formats the key-value pair from the dictionary without using double quotes around the value. This change ensures that the generated command list matches the expected list without any extra characters.
