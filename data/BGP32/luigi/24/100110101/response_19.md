### Analysis
1. The buggy function `_dict_arg` takes in a `name` and a `value` parameter, where `value` is expected to be a dictionary.
2. The function iterates over the key-value pairs in the dictionary and constructs a list called `command` where each item in the list is formed by combining the `name` parameter with the key and value from the dictionary.
3. The main issue causing the bug is that when constructing the elements to add to the `command` list, it wraps both the property and value in quotes, which leads to discrepancies when compared with expected values in the test cases.
4. The fix involves removing the unnecessary quotes from around the property-value pairs being added to the `command` list.

### Bug cause
The bug arises from incorrect handling of constructing command arguments in the `_dict_arg` function. When adding elements to the `command` list, unnecessary double quotes are included around property-value pairs, causing mismatches with expected values in the test cases.

### Bug fix strategy
To fix the bug, remove the unnecessary quotes when constructing the elements to add to the `command` list. This adjustment will ensure that the output matches the expected values in the test cases.

### Corrected code
```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():  # change variable name from 'value' to 'val' to avoid confusion
            command += [name, '{0}={1}'.format(prop, val)]  # Remove unnecessary quotes
    return command
``` 

By making this adjustment, the function should now correctly construct the command arguments as expected by the test cases, passing them successfully.
