The bug in the `_dict_arg` function lies in how the function creates the command list. The function currently wraps the property-value pair in double quotes in the command list, resulting in a mismatch between the expected and actual outputs.

To fix the bug, we need to remove the double quotes around the property-value pair in the `command` list.

Here is the corrected version of the `_dict_arg` function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, value in value.items():
            command += [name, '{0}={1}'.format(prop, value)]
    return command
```

By making this change, the function will generate the command list correctly without unnecessary double quotes.

This correction should enable the function to pass both failing tests as the output generated will match the expected values without additional quotes causing mismatches.
