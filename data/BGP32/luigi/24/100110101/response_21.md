The bug in the `_dict_arg` function is caused by adding extra quotes around the property-value pair when constructing the command list. This results in a mismatch with the expected values, leading to assertion errors in the tests.

To fix the bug, we need to remove the unnecessary quotes around the property-value pair before appending it to the command list.

Here is the corrected version of the `_dict_arg` function:

```python
# Updated and corrected version of the _dict_arg function
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, '{0}={1}'.format(prop, val)]
    return command
```

By making this change, the function will now correctly construct the command list without extra quotes around the property-value pairs. This corrected version should pass the failing tests and satisfy the expected input/output variable values.
