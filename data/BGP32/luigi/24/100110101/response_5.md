### Bug Explanation:
The bug in the `_dict_arg` function arises from the code `'"{0}={1}"'.format(prop, value)`, which surrounds the property and value with double quotes. This results in the values being formatted as strings with double quotes included, causing a mismatch with the expected values in the test cases. 

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix this bug, we need to modify the code in the `_dict_arg` function to remove the double quotes around the property and value when constructing the command list.

### Corrected Function:
```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, '{0}={1}'.format(prop, val)]
    return command
``` 

By removing the double quotes in the formatting string, the corrected function should now generate the command list without enclosing the property and value in quotes, resolving the mismatch with the expected values in the test cases.
