### Analysis
The `value` parameter in the `_dict_arg` function is getting overwritten in the loop, causing unexpected behavior. This results in only the last key-value pair being added to the `command` list.

### Bug Explanation
In the `_dict_arg` function, as the loop iterates over the dictionary `value.items()`, the loop variable `value` is being overwritten with the values of the dictionary. This causes the issue where only the last key-value pair is being added to the `command` list.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to use a different variable name for the loop variable inside the for loop, to avoid overwriting the `value` parameter. Then construct the command list correctly with the key-value pairs from the dictionary.

### Corrected Function
```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: luigi/contrib/spark.py

def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():  # Changed variable name to 'val' to avoid overwriting 'value'
            command += [name, '"{0}={1}"'.format(prop, val)]  # Using 'val' instead of 'value'
    return command
```

By making this change, the corrected function will correctly construct the `command` list with all the key-value pairs from the input dictionary. This change will ensure that the function passes the failing test cases and behaves as expected.
