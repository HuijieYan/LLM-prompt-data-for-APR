The buggy function `_dict_arg` has a bug where it reuses the variable name `value` inside the loop, causing unexpected behavior. This can lead to incorrect values being added to the `command` list.

To fix this bug, we can rename the inner loop variable from `value` to something else to avoid the conflict with the parameter name `value`.

Here is the corrected version of the `_dict_arg` function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():  # Renamed variable from value to val
            command += [name, '"{0}={1}"'.format(prop, val)]
    return command
```

With this fix, the function should now correctly generate the command list based on the input dictionary.

This corrected version of the function should pass the failing test cases provided.
