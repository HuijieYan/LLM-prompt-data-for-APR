### Bug Explanation:
The bug in the `_dict_arg` function is caused by reusing the variable name `value` for both the input dictionary value and the iterating variable within the loop. This leads to the inner loop overwriting the value of the outer loop. As a result, the command list is not correctly populated with the key-value pairs from the input dictionary.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix this bug, we should use a different variable name for the iterating variable in the loop to avoid overwriting the value from the input dictionary. This will ensure that each key-value pair is correctly added to the command list.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():  # Use a different variable name for iteration
            command += [name, '"{0}={1}"'.format(prop, val)]  # Use the new variable name
    return command
```
