The issue with the given `_dict_arg` function is that it reuses the variable name `value` within the loop, which causes unexpected behavior. When the loop iterates through the `value.items()`, it reassigns the variable `value` to the inner loop's value, losing the original value. This leads to only the last key-value pair being included in the `command` list.

To fix this issue, we need to change the variable name used in the inner loop. Here is the corrected version of the `_dict_arg` function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, prop_value in value.items():
            command += [name, '"{0}={1}"'.format(prop, prop_value)]
    return command
```

By changing `value` to `prop_value` within the loop, we ensure that the original `value` remains unchanged, and each key-value pair is correctly added to the `command` list.

The corrected function should now pass both test cases provided in `spark_test.py` and generate the expected output values for each case.
