### Analysis:
The `_dict_arg` function is intended to take a dictionary as input, iterate over its key-value pairs, and generate a list of command arguments based on the keys and values. The bug seems to be in the line where `'"{0}={1}"'.format(prop, value)` is used to format the key and value pair. The issue arises due to reusing the variable name `value` both as the input parameter and the iterating variable inside the loop.

### Bug Explanation:
In the buggy function, the variable `value` is being overwritten in the for loop, causing the loop to incorrectly construct the command arguments. This results in incorrect command generation and ultimately leads to failing test cases.

### Bug Fix:
To fix the bug, we need to use a different variable name in the for loop to avoid overwriting the function parameter `value`. We can change the iterating variable name to something like `val` to prevent this conflict.

### Corrected Version:
```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: luigi/contrib/spark.py

def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():  # Change variable name to val
            command += [name, '"{0}={1}"'.format(prop, val)]  # Change variable name to val
    return command
```

By making this change, the function will now correctly construct the command arguments without facing the variable overwriting issue, and the correct values will be used for generating the command list.
