## Analysis:
The bug in the `_dict_arg` function lies in using the same variable name `value` to iterate through the dictionary in the `for` loop, which causes the original `value` parameter to be overwritten. This results in incorrect key-value pairs being added to the `command` list.

## Bug Cause:
The bug occurs because the `value` variable is being reassigned within the loop, causing the original `value` parameter to be lost and leading to incorrect key-value pairs being added to the `command` list.

## Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to use a different variable name inside the loop to avoid overwriting the original `value` parameter. By doing this, we can correctly construct the `command` list with the expected key-value pairs from the input dictionary.

## Corrected Version:
```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command.append(name)
            command.append('"{}={}"'.format(prop, val))
    return command
```

By using a different variable `val` inside the loop, we can correctly construct the `command` list with the expected key-value pairs.
