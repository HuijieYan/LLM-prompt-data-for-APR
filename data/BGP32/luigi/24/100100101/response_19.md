The buggy function `_dict_arg` is not correctly constructing the command list based on the input dictionary. The issue lies in the variable names used inside the for loop (prop and value) conflicting with the function parameter name (value). This conflict leads to unexpected behavior and incorrect construction of the command list.

To fix this bug, we need to rename the loop variable `value` to something else so that it doesn't overwrite the function parameter `value`.

Here is the corrected version of the `_dict_arg` function:

```python
# Corrected version of the buggy function
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, '"{0}={1}"'.format(prop, val)]
    return command
```

By renaming the loop variable `value` to `val`, we avoid overwriting the function parameter `value` and ensure that the command list is constructed correctly based on the input dictionary.

This corrected version of the function should now pass the failing test cases and satisfy the expected input/output values.
