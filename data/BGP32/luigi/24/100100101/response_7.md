### Analysis
The `_dict_arg` function is intended to take a dictionary as input and convert it into a list of command arguments. The bug seems to be in the way the function is constructing the command list from the dictionary entries.

### Potential Error Locations
1. Using the same variable name `value` for the dictionary value inside the loop.
2. Incorrect formatting of the command list.

### Bug Explanation
The bug in the `_dict_arg` function is causing the command list to be constructed incorrectly, leading to incorrect command arguments being generated. The function fails to properly separate the key-value pairs from the input dictionary into the format required for the command list.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug
1. Use a different variable name for the inner loop value to avoid conflicts.
2. Ensure proper formatting of the command list with key-value pairs.

### Corrected Version of the Function
```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, '"{0}={1}"'.format(prop, val)]
    return command
```

By making these changes, the function should now correctly format the input dictionary into a list of command arguments, resolving the bug.
