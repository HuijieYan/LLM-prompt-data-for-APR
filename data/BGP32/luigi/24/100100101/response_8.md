### Explanation:
The buggy function `_dict_arg` is intended to iterate over a dictionary and create a list of command arguments based on the key-value pairs in the dictionary. The bug in the function lies in reusing the variable name `value` for both the input dictionary and the individual values within the dictionary, which leads to overwriting the original `value` parameter. This results in incorrect command generation.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to use a separate variable within the loop to store the individual values from the dictionary while iterating. By doing this, we ensure that the original input dictionary `value` is not modified during the loop execution.

### Corrected Function:
```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():  # Change variable name from value to val
            command += [name, '"{0}={1}"'.format(prop, val)]  # Use val instead of value
    return command
```

By making this modification, the corrected function will properly generate command arguments based on the input dictionary without modifying the original input value. This corrected version should pass the failing test cases provided.
