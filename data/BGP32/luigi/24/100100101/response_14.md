The bug in the `_dict_arg` function lies in the reassignment of the loop variable `value` inside the loop iteration. This causes unexpected behavior and results in incorrect command generation.

To fix this bug, we should rename the loop variable in the for loop to avoid reassignment. Here is the corrected version of the `_dict_arg` function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, prop_value in value.items():  # Rename loop variable to prop_value
            command += [name, '"{0}={1}"'.format(prop, prop_value)]
    return command
```

By renaming the loop variable inside the for loop to `prop_value`, we prevent the accidental reassignment of the loop variable. This corrected version of the function should now pass the failing test cases provided.
