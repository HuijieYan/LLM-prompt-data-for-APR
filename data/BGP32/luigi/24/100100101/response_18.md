The bug in the `_dict_arg` function is caused by using the same variable name `value` for both the input parameter and the loop variable within the function. This causes the original `value` to be overwritten within the loop, leading to the incorrect construction of the `command` list.

To fix this bug, we should use a different variable name for the loop variable to avoid overwriting the original `value`.

Here is the corrected version of the `_dict_arg` function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, prop_value in value.items():
            command += [name, '"{0}={1}"'.format(prop, prop_value)]
    return command
```

By using `prop_value` as the loop variable instead of `value`, the function now correctly constructs the `command` list by appending key-value pairs from the input dictionary `value`.

This corrected version should pass the failing test cases provided.
