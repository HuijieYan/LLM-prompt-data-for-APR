The buggy function `_dict_arg` is supposed to create a command list based on a dictionary input, where each key-value pair becomes an element in the command list. The bug lies in reusing the variable name `value` in the loop, which overwrites the input `value` dictionary. This causes the function to only process the last key-value pair in the dictionary.

To fix the bug, rename the loop variable `value` to something else to avoid conflict with the input parameter `value`.

Here is the corrected version of the `_dict_arg` function:
```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, prop_value in value.items():
            command += [name, '"{0}={1}"'.format(prop, prop_value)]
    return command
```

By changing the loop variable name to `prop_value`, we ensure that the input `value` dictionary is not inadvertently modified, and each key-value pair is correctly processed to generate the command list. This corrected version should now pass the failing test cases.
