### Analysis
- The `_dict_arg` function is intended to convert a dictionary into a list of command arguments based on the key-value pairs in the dictionary.
- The function is currently iterating over the key-value pairs in the input dictionary and formatting them incorrectly to create the command list.
- The bug seems to be caused by the incorrect formatting of the key-value pairs as command arguments.

### Bug
The bug in the `_dict_arg` function lies in how the key-value pairs are being formatted. The function is enclosing the entire key-value pair in double quotes, which is not necessary and leads to incorrect formatting of the command arguments.

### Fix
To fix the bug, we need to modify the formatting of the key-value pairs to only include the key and value without enclosing them in double quotes unnecessarily.

### Updated _dict_arg function
```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: luigi/contrib/spark.py

# This is the corrected function
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, '{0}={1}'.format(prop, val)]
    return command
```

By correcting the formatting of the key-value pairs in the `_dict_arg` function, the function should now correctly convert the input dictionary into a list of command arguments as expected.
