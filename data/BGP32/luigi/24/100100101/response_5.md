The buggy function `_dict_arg` is intended to construct command arguments based on the input dictionary `value`. The bug lies in the fact that the inner loop overwrites the `value` variable, causing incorrect values to be appended to the `command` list.

### Bug Explanation:
In the buggy function, the inner loop iterates over the dictionary `value`, where the loop variable is also named `value`. This causes the loop variable to overwrite the input `value` dictionary, leading to unexpected behavior and incorrect command construction.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we should use a different variable name for the loop iteration in order to avoid overwriting the input `value` dictionary. By using a distinct variable name for the loop, we can prevent unintended modifications to the original `value` dictionary.

### Corrected Version of `_dict_arg` Function:
```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():  # Use a different variable name (e.g., 'val') to avoid overwriting
            command += [name, '"{0}={1}"'.format(prop, val)]
    return command
```

By updating the loop variable name to `val`, we ensure that the original `value` dictionary remains intact, and the correct values are appended to the `command` list as expected. This corrected version of the function should now pass the failing test cases while satisfying the expected input/output variable values.
