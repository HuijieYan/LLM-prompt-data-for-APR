The issue in the provided `_dict_arg` function lies in the fact that it reuses the variable name `value` within the loop, which overwrites the original `value` dictionary. This leads to incorrect formatting of the command list. To fix this bug, we need to use different variable names for the loop iteration.

Here is the corrected version of the `_dict_arg` function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for key, val in value.items():  # Use key, val instead of prop, value
            command += [name, '"{0}={1}"'.format(key, val)]
    return command
```

By making this change, the function will correctly format the command list based on the key-value pairs in the input dictionary, without overwriting any variables.

This corrected version should pass both test cases provided.
