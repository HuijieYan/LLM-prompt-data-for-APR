The bug in the provided function `_dict_arg` is caused by the reusing of the variable name `value` in the `for` loop, which overwrites the original value passed as an argument to the function. This leads to incorrect command generation.

To fix this bug, we need to use a different variable name in the loop to iterate over the dictionary items. We can change `value` inside the loop to something like `v` to avoid confusion and retain the original value passed to the function.

Here is the corrected version of the function `_dict_arg`:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, v in value.items():
            command += [name, '"{0}={1}"'.format(prop, v)]
    return command
```

This corrected version should now pass both the failing test cases provided, satisfying the expected input/output values for each case.
