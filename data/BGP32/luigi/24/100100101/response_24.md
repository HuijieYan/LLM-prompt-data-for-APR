The issue with the `_dict_arg` function is that it reuses the variable name `value` in the for loop, which overrides the original value being passed to the function. This leads to incorrect behavior when constructing the `command` list. The correct approach is to use a different variable name in the loop to avoid this conflict.

Here is the corrected version of the `_dict_arg` function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():  # changed variable name from 'value' to 'val' to avoid conflict
            command += [name, '"{0}={1}"'.format(prop, val)]
    return command
```

By changing the loop variable name to `val`, we ensure that the original `value` is preserved and the `command` list is constructed correctly.

This corrected version of the function should now pass the failing tests with the expected input/output values.
