The buggy function `_dict_arg` is designed to convert a dictionary into a list of command arguments. The bug lies in the fact that the loop variable `value` is used both as the dictionary values and as the loop variable itself, causing the loop to override the original `value` dictionary.

To fix this bug, we should use a different variable name for the loop variable. Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():  # use a different variable name here
            command += [name, '"{0}={1}"'.format(prop, val)]
    return command
```

With this correction, the function should now correctly convert the dictionary into a list of command arguments without overwriting the original dictionary values.

The corrected function will now pass the failing tests as described in the provided cases.
