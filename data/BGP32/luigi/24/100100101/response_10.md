### Analysis:
The `_dict_arg` function is designed to handle dictionary input and convert it into a list of command line arguments. The bug seems to be in the way the function constructs the command list for dictionary input. It is not creating the arguments correctly when iterating over the dictionary items.

### Bug:
The bug lies in how the function constructs the command list. In the line `command += [name, '"{0}={1}"'.format(prop, value)]`, it is not correctly formatting the argument string.

### Fix:
To fix the bug, we should modify the way the function constructs the command list to ensure it correctly formats the argument strings.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, '{0}={1}'.format(prop, val)]
    return command
``` 

By making this change, the function will correctly format the argument strings and build the command list as required. This corrected version should now pass the failing test cases and produce the expected output values.
