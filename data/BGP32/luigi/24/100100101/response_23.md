The buggy function `_dict_arg` is designed to take in a `name` and a `value`, where `value` is expected to be a dictionary. The function then iterates over the key-value pairs in the dictionary and constructs a list `command` with the format `[name, 'key=value']`.

The bug in the function lies in the fact that it overwrites the variable `value` within the loop, causing unexpected behavior. To fix this issue, we can rename the loop variable from `value` to something else to avoid overwriting the input parameter.

Here is the corrected version of the `_dict_arg` function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, prop_value in value.items():
            command += [name, '"{0}={1}"'.format(prop, prop_value)]
    return command
```

By renaming the loop variable to `prop_value`, we ensure that the original `value` parameter is not mistakenly modified within the loop.

This corrected version of the function should now pass the failing test cases provided.
