### Analysis:
The `_dict_arg` function accepts a name and a dictionary as input parameters. It then iterates over the key-value pairs in the dictionary and constructs a command list with the format `[name, "prop=value"]` for each key-value pair.

The bug in the current implementation lies in the fact that the inner variable name `value` is being overwritten within the for loop, causing unexpected behavior and incorrect command construction.

### Bug Explanation:
In the original implementation, when constructing the `command` list, the variable `value` is used both as the inner loop variable and as the input parameter. This causes the inner loop variable `value` to overwrite the input parameter `value`, leading to incorrect command construction.

### Bug Fix:
To fix the bug, we need to rename the inner loop variable from `value` to something distinct to avoid overwriting the input parameter. Additionally, we should append the correct key-value pair in the `command` list.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():  # renaming the inner loop variable value to val
            command += [name, '"{0}={1}"'.format(prop, val)]  # appending the correct key-value pair to command list
    return command
``` 

By making these changes, the corrected function should now handle key-value pairs correctly and construct the expected command list.
