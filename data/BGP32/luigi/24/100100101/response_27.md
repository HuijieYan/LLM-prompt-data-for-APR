### Analysis
The buggy function `_dict_arg` is supposed to construct a command list based on a dictionary input. However, there are some issues with the way the dictionary items are processed and added to the command list. The bug seems to be related to the variable naming conflict within the for loop, where both the loop variable `value` and the dictionary value `value` are used.

### Bug Explanation
In the buggy function `_dict_arg`, the for loop iterates over the dictionary items, but when trying to append items to the `command` list, it uses the same variable name `value` for both the loop variable and the dictionary value. This leads to the incorrect construction of the command list, causing the test cases to fail.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, rename one of the variables within the for loop to avoid naming conflicts. Additionally, modify how the key-value pairs are formatted and added to the command list to ensure the correct structure.

### Corrected Version
```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for key, val in value.items():
            command += [name, '"{0}={1}"'.format(key, val)]
    return command
```

By renaming the loop variables (`key` and `val`) and properly formatting key-value pairs in the command list, the corrected version of the `_dict_arg` function should now handle dictionary inputs correctly.
