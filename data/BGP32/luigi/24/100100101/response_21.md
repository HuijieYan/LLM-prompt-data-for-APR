The buggy function `_dict_arg` is not handling the dictionary values correctly when constructing the command list. The issue arises from reusing the variable `value` for both the outer and inner dictionary values within the loop. This leads to incorrect values being added to the `command` list.

To fix this bug, we should use a different variable name for the inner loop value to avoid overwriting the outer value. Additionally, we should handle the case where the value is not a dictionary by returning an empty list in that scenario.

Here is the corrected version of the `_dict_arg` function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, f'"{prop}={val}"']
    return command
```

With this correction, the function should now handle dictionary values correctly and output the expected command list based on the input dictionary values.
