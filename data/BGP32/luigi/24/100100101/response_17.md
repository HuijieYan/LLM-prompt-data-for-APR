### Analysis:
The `_dict_arg` function is intended to generate a list of command arguments based on a dictionary input. The bug seems to be in the line where the function is constructing the command list by concatenating the name and the formatted property-value pair. The bug is causing the property to be overridden by the value in the loop.

### Cause of the Bug:
The bug occurs because the loop variable `value` is being overridden by the loop iteration value when constructing the command list. This causes the property key to be lost and only the last property-value pair to be retained in the final list.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to use a different variable name inside the loop to avoid overwriting the loop iteration values. This will ensure that both the property key and its corresponding value are included correctly in the command list.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():  # Change the variable name from value to val
            command += [name, '"{0}={1}"'.format(prop, val)]
    return command
```

With this correction, the function should now correctly construct the command list with all property-value pairs included as expected in the test cases provided.
