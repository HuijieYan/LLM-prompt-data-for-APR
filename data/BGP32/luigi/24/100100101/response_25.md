### Analysis:
The buggy function `_dict_arg` is intended to create a command list based on a dictionary input. It iterates over the key-value pairs in the dictionary and constructs command elements accordingly. However, the bug lies in the fact that the variable `value` is being overwritten within the loop, which leads to unexpected behavior.

### Bug Explanation:
1. In the first case, when the input dictionary is `{'Prop': 'Value'}`, the function should generate `['--conf', 'Prop=Value']`. However, since the inner loop variable `value` is the same as the input parameter `value`, it gets overwritten with the inner value during the loop iteration. This leads to incorrect command generation.

2. In the second case, a similar behavior can be observed where the input dictionary is `{'prop1': 'val1'}`, and the expected command should be `['--conf', 'prop1=val1']`. However, due to the variable overwriting issue, the output is incorrect.

### Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, it's necessary to change the variable name used in the loop to avoid overwriting the function parameter `value`. This can be achieved by using a distinct name such as `prop` for the inner loop variable in the loop.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():  # Change variable name to avoid overwriting
            command += [name, '"{0}={1}"'.format(prop, val)]
    return command
```

By updating the loop variable name to `val`, the function will now correctly iterate over the input dictionary and generate the expected command elements without overwriting the main dictionary value variable.
