The bug in the provided function `_dict_arg` lies in the re-use of the variable name `value` in the for loop, which overwrites the input `value` to the function. This causes the function to incorrectly generate the `command` list by using the nested `value` instead of `prop`. 

To fix this bug, we can simply rename the inner loop variable from `value` to something else like `v` to avoid overshadowing the input `value`.

Here is the corrected version of the function `_dict_arg`:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, v in value.items():
            command += [name, '"{0}={1}"'.format(prop, v)]
    return command
```

By making this change, the function should now correctly generate the `command` list based on the input dictionary `value` without any variable overshadowing issues. This correction should make the function pass the provided failing tests and satisfy the expected input/output values.
