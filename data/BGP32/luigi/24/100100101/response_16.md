The bug in the `_dict_arg` function lies in the fact that the inner loop is using the same variable name `value` for both the outer and inner loop which causes the issue.

The corrected version of the function is provided below:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():  # changed variable name to 'val'
            command += [name, '"{0}={1}"'.format(prop, val)]  # changed variable name to 'val'
    return command
```

By changing the variable name in the inner loop from `value` to `val`, we prevent the conflict with the outer loop and correctly construct the command list.
