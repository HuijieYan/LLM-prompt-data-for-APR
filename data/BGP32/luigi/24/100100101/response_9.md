The bug in the `_dict_arg` function lies in reusing the variable name `value` in the loop where we iterate over the dictionary items. This leads to potential conflicts and incorrect values being appended to the `command` list.

To fix this bug, we need to change the name of the inner loop variable from `value` to something else (e.g., `val`). This will prevent the shadowing of the `value` variable passed to the function and ensure correct values are appended to the `command` list.

Here is the corrected version of the `_dict_arg` function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, f'"{prop}={val}"']
    return command
```

By making this change, the function will correctly create a list of command arguments based on the input dictionary, ensuring that the correct values are used.

This corrected version should now pass the failing test cases provided.
