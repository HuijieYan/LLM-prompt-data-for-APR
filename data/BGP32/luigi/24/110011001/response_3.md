### Analysis
The buggy function `_dict_arg` is meant to generate a list of command arguments based on a dictionary input. The issue arises when formatting the dictionary entries into strings within the list. The function incorrectly includes double quotes around the values, causing discrepancies with the expected output when compared later in the tests. The quotes around the values are unnecessary and lead to the failing tests.

### Bug Cause
The bug is caused by the unnecessary double quotes around the dictionary values when formatting them in the command list. This discrepancy in formatting results in the failure of the equality check in the test cases.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, the unnecessary double quotes around the values when adding them to the command list should be removed. This will align the generated command list with the expected format for comparison in the tests.

### Corrected Version
```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, prop_value in value.items():  # Must use a different name for the inner loop value
            command += [name, '{0}={1}'.format(prop, prop_value)]  # Removed double quotes
    return command
```

With this corrected version, the unnecessary double quotes around the values in the command list are removed, aligning the generated command list with the expected format, resulting in passing tests.
