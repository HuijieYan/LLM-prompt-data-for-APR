### Bug Explanation
The bug occurs because the `_dict_arg` function adds the values from the dictionary as formatted strings within double quotes. However, the test cases assume that the values should not be enclosed in double quotes. This leads to a mismatch in the expected and actual command lists, causing the tests to fail.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to modify the `_dict_arg` function to add the values from the dictionary without enclosing them in double quotes.

### Corrected Version
```python
# The corrected version of the buggy function
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, '{0}={1}'.format(prop, val)]
    return command
``` 

With this correction, we are formatting the dictionary values without double quotes, which should align with the expectations of the test cases.
