### Bug Explanation
The bug in the `_dict_arg` function is caused by quoting the dictionary values with double quotes when constructing the `command` list. This leads to a mismatch when comparing the expected command list in the test cases, as the quotes are not expected in the final command.

### Fix Strategy
To fix this bug, we need to remove the unnecessary double quotes around the dictionary values when constructing the command list.

### Corrected Version of the Function
```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, '{0}={1}'.format(prop, val)]
    return command
```

By making this change, the function will correctly construct the command list without unnecessary quotes around the dictionary values. This correction should resolve the failing tests.
