The issue in the buggy function is related to the formatting of the values in the dictionary when constructing the `command` list. The values from the dictionary are being enclosed in double quotes and equals sign unnecessarily, resulting in a mismatch when comparing the expected command list in the test cases.

The root cause of the bug is that the buggy function is formatting the dictionary values incorrectly with double quotes. This causes a mismatch when comparing the expected command list in the test cases where the values from the dictionary are not enclosed in double quotes.

To fix the bug, the function should modify the way it constructs the `command` list from the dictionary values. The values should be added directly without additional formatting.

Here is the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
class SparkSubmitTask(luigi.Task):
    def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
        command = []
        if value and isinstance(value, dict):
            for prop, prop_value in value.items():
                command += [name, '{0}={1}'.format(prop, prop_value)]
        return command
```

By removing the unnecessary double quotes and formatting, the corrected function will construct the `command` list correctly, which will resolve the mismatch issue in the test cases.
