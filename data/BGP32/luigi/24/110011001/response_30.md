### Analysis
The buggy function `_dict_arg` is designed to iterate over a dictionary `value` and generate command arguments based on the key-value pairs. However, a bug exists in the function where the value is being enclosed in double quotes `"` when constructing the command arguments. This results in a mismatch between the expected command list and the actual generated command list, causing the test cases to fail.

### Bug Explanation
1. In Case 1, the dictionary `{'Prop': 'Value'}` is passed to the function with the name `--conf`. The function constructs the command `['--conf', '"Prop=Value"']` where the value part `Value` is enclosed in double quotes, leading to the mismatch in the test.
   
2. In Case 2, the dictionary `{'prop1': 'val1'}` is passed to the function with the name `--conf`. The function incorrectly constructs the command `['--conf', '"prop1=val1"']`, again causing a mismatch in the test.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, the function needs to stop enclosing the values in double quotes when constructing the command list. The values should be added directly to the command list without any additional quotes.

### Corrected Code
```python
class SparkSubmitTask(luigi.Task):

    def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
        command = []
        if value and isinstance(value, dict):
            for prop, val in value.items():
                command += [name, '{0}={1}'.format(prop, val)]  # Fix: Removed unnecessary double quotes
        return command
```

By making this change, the function will correctly construct the command list without adding unnecessary quotes around the values, resolving the test failures.
