### Analysis
The buggy function `_dict_arg` is intended to convert a dictionary key-value pair into a format suitable for command line arguments. The issue arises from the fact that the function is incorrectly adding double quotes around the property value. This leads to a mismatch when comparing the expected command list to the actual generated command list in the test cases.

### Bug Cause
The bug is caused by the function adding double quotes around the property value in the command list. This results in a mismatch with the expected command list in the test cases, leading to the assertion errors.

### Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to modify the `_dict_arg` function to correctly format the key-value pairs without including unnecessary double quotes.

### Corrected Code
```python
class SparkSubmitTask(luigi.Task):
    # other class code here...

    def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
        command = []
        if value and isinstance(value, dict):
            for prop, val in value.items():
                command += [name, '{0}={1}'.format(prop, val)]
        return command
```

With this correction, the function will generate the command list without adding unnecessary double quotes around the property value. This should address the issue and make the tests pass successfully.
