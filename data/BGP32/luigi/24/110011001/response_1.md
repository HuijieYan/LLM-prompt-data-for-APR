### Analysis
1. The `_dict_arg` function is supposed to construct a list of command arguments based on a given name and dictionary of properties. The function iterates over the dictionary, concatenates the name, property, and value in the correct format, and appends it to the `command` list.
   
2. The bug seems to be related to the way the `value` is handled when constructing the command list. The function is wrapping the value within double quotes when adding it to the command list, which is unnecessary and causes a difference in the final list when compared with expected values.

### Bug Explanation
1. In both cases, the function incorrectly constructs the command list by adding an extra level of quoting around the property value. This causes the actual command list to have an extra pair of double quotes around the property value compared to the expected output.
   
2. This extra quoting is the reason for the assertion errors in the tests as the expected and actual lists differ due to this incorrect handling of the property values.

### Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, the function should not include the property value inside double quotes when appending it to the command list. By removing the unnecessary double quotes, the generated command list should align with the expected values, resolving the assertion failures.

### Corrected Version
```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, '{0}={1}'.format(prop, val)]
    return command
```
