### Analysis
The `_dict_arg` function is designed to construct a list of command-line arguments from a dictionary. The bug arises from the way the function handles the key-value pair in the dictionary. It incorrectly encloses the value in double quotes leading to a mismatch with the expected output.

### Bug Explanation
The bug occurs because the function incorrectly quotes the value when constructing each argument in the command list. This results in an extra set of double quotes around the property-value pair, causing the expected and actual lists to differ.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we should remove the double quotes around the property and value when constructing the argument in the command list.

### Corrected Version
```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, '{0}={1}'.format(prop, val)]
    return command
```

By making this change, the function will correctly construct the command list without enclosing the value in double quotes, resolving the bug.
