### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_dict_arg` is meant to take a key-value pair dictionary and convert it into a list of strings of the format `name key=value`. However, the function is incorrectly wrapping the values in double quotes, causing the test cases to fail.
   
2. The error messages indicate that the values in the generated command list are not matching the expected values due to the presence of unnecessary double quotes around the property values.

### Bug Cause:
The cause of the bug is in the `_dict_arg` function where the values of the dictionary are being wrapped in double quotes, causing a mismatch with the expected values in the test cases.

### Bug Fix:
To fix the bug, we need to remove the unnecessary double quotes around the values when constructing the command list.

### Corrected Version:
```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: luigi/contrib/spark.py

# The declaration of the class containing the corrected function
class SparkSubmitTask(luigi.Task):
    """
    Template task for running a Spark job
    
    Supports running jobs on Spark local, standalone, Mesos or Yarn
    
    See http://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/submitting-applications.html
    for more information
    """

    def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
        command = []
        if value and isinstance(value, dict):
            for prop, val in value.items():
                command += [name, '{0}={1}'.format(prop, val)]
        return command
```

By removing the unnecessary double quotes when constructing the command list, the corrected version of the `_dict_arg` function should now generate the expected command list without causing assertion errors in the test cases.
