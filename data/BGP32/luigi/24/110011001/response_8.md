### Analysis
The buggy function `_dict_arg` is supposed to take a dictionary as input and convert it into a list of command line arguments by formatting each key-value pair in the dictionary. However, the function is incorrectly adding extra quotes around the values of the arguments, which is causing the assertion errors in the failing tests.

### Bug Explanation
The bug in the function is caused by the line:
```python
command += [name, '"{0}={1}"'.format(prop, value)]
```
This line is incorrectly adding double quotes around the formatted key-value pair, resulting in strings like `'"Prop=Value"'` instead of `'Prop=Value'`.

### Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to remove the unnecessary quotes from around the formatted key-value pair and simply concatenate the key and value without any additional formatting.

### Corrected Version
```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, value in value.items():
            command += [name, '{0}={1}'.format(prop, value)]
    return command
``` 

By correcting the function as above, it will correctly format the key-value pairs without introducing any extra quotes. This should resolve the assertion errors in the failing tests.
