### Analysis
The buggy function `_dict_arg` is intended to construct command arguments in form of key-value pairs from a dictionary input. However, the function is incorrectly enclosing the property values in double quotes, causing a mismatch with the expected format in the test cases. This incorrect formatting is causing the assertion errors in the tests.

### Bug Explanation
1. In Case 1, the value `"Prop=Value"` is enclosed in double quotes, causing a mismatch with the expected value of `Prop=Value`.
2. In Case 2, the value `"prop1=val1"` is enclosed in double quotes, causing a mismatch with the expected value of `prop1=val1`.

### Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, modify the `_dict_arg` function to not include double quotes around the property values when constructing the command arguments from the dictionary input.

### Corrected Version of the Function
```python
# The corrected version of the buggy function
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, "{0}={1}".format(prop, val)]
    return command
```
