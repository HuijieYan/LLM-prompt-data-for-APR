### Analysis
1. The function `_dict_arg` is intended to format dictionary arguments into a list of strings for command-line execution.
2. The function incorrectly surrounds the values with double quotes, causing a mismatch with the expected format.
3. The error message indicates that the formatted strings are not matching the expected values, leading to assertion failures.
4. The strategy for fixing the bug is to remove the extra double quotes surrounding the values in the command list.
5. The corrected version of the function is provided below.

### Corrected Version
```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: luigi/contrib/spark.py

# The declaration of the corrected class containing the fixed function
class SparkSubmitTask(luigi.Task):
    """
    Template task for running a Spark job
    
    Supports running jobs on Spark local, standalone, Mesos or Yarn
    
    See http://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/submitting-applications.html
    for more information
    """

    # The corrected function without the double quotes around the values
    def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
        command = []
        if value and isinstance(value, dict):
            for prop, val in value.items():
                command += [name, '{0}={1}'.format(prop, val)]
        return command
```

By removing the unnecessary double quotes in the values formatted in the command list, the corrected function should now generate the expected command list and pass the failing tests.
