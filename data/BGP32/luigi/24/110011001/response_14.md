### Issues:
1. The buggy function `_dict_arg` is incorrectly formatting dictionary values by adding double quotes around the property values.
2. This incorrect formatting is causing the assertion errors in the test cases because the expected values do not have double quotes around the property values.

### Cause of the Bug:
The buggy function `_dict_arg` is adding double quotes around the property values when constructing the command list. This results in a mismatch between the expected command list in the test cases and the actual command list generated by the function.

### Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to remove the addition of double quotes around the property values when constructing the command list. This will ensure that the generated command list matches the expected command list in the test cases.

### Corrected Version:
```python
class SparkSubmitTask(luigi.Task):
    def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
        command = []
        if value and isinstance(value, dict):
            for prop, val in value.items():
                command += [name, "{0}={1}".format(prop, val)]
        return command
```

By making this change, the corrected function will format the dictionary values correctly without adding unnecessary double quotes. This should resolve the assertion errors in the failing test cases.
