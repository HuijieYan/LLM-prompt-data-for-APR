### Analysis:
The buggy function `_dict_arg` is intended to convert a dictionary into a list of key-value pairs with a specific format. The issue arises from how the function handles the value in the dictionary. It incorrectly adds double quotes when formatting the value, leading to discrepancies when comparing the expected command with the actual command.

### Bug:
The bug in the function is caused by adding unnecessary double quotes around the property values when constructing the command list. This discrepancy in formatting causes the test assertions to fail.

### Fix:
To fix the bug, we should remove the unnecessary double quotes when formatting the property values in the command list. This will align the actual command structure with the expected command structure, allowing the tests to pass.

### Corrected Version:
```python
class SparkSubmitTask(luigi.Task):
    def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
        command = []
        if value and isinstance(value, dict):
            for prop, val in value.items():  # Rename 'value' to 'val' to avoid name collision
                command += [name, '{0}={1}'.format(prop, val)]  # Remove unnecessary double quotes
        return command
``` 

By making the above correction, the function will now correctly generate the command list without unnecessary double quotes around property values, ensuring that the tests pass successfully.
