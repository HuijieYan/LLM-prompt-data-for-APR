### Analyzing the Bug
- The buggy function `_dict_arg` takes in a `name` (str) and `value` (dict) as input parameters.
- It constructs a command list by iterating over the key-value pairs of the input `value` dictionary and appending `name` along with the key-value pair formatted as a string to the command list.
- The issue arises because the value pairs are being added as string representations of the key-value pairs, enclosed in double quotes, which are not expected by the calling unit tests.
- The error messages suggest that the values in the command list are not matching the expected values due to the presence of additional double quotes around the values. 

### Bug Fix Strategy
To address the bug in the `_dict_arg` function, we need to modify how the key-value pairs are added to the command list. Instead of enclosing the values in double quotes, we should directly add them as `key=value` strings. This change will align the function's output with the expected values from the unit tests.

### Corrected Version of the Function

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, "{0}={1}".format(prop, val)]
    return command
```

By making this adjustment, the corrected version of the function will properly construct the command list without additional double quotes around the values. This modification should resolve the discrepancies between the generated command list and the expected values in the unit tests.
