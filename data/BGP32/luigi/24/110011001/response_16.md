### Analysis
The buggy function `_dict_arg` is intended to convert a dictionary into a list of command line arguments. The bug seems to occur when it formats the dictionary values to include quotes around them. This leads to a discrepancy in the expected result compared to the actual result.

The issue is arising due to the usage of unnecessary double quotes around the values in the command list, which is causing the lists to differ in the test cases.

### Bug Explanation
The bug occurs because the function is adding double quotes around the values when formatting the dictionary to create command line arguments. However, the tests are not expecting these double quotes in the resulting command list.

### Fix Strategy
To fix this bug, we need to remove the unnecessary double quotes around the values when constructing the command list from the dictionary. This will align the function output with the expected output in the tests.

### Corrected Version
```python
class SparkSubmitTask(luigi.Task):
    def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
        command = []
        if value and isinstance(value, dict):
            for prop, prop_value in value.items():
                command += [name, '{0}={1}'.format(prop, prop_value)]
        return command
```

By updating the `_dict_arg` function as shown above, we remove the unnecessary double quotes around the values, ensuring that the resulting command list matches the expected format in the tests.
