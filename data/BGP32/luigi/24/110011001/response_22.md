The bug in the `_dict_arg` function is due to the extra quotes being added around the property value when constructing the command list. This results in a mismatch between the expected command list and the actual command list when the test is run.

### Bug Cause:
- The buggy function `_dict_arg` adds unnecessary double quotes around the property value when formatting the command list.
- This leads to the actual command list containing values with double quotes, causing a mismatch with the expected command list in the test cases.

### Proposed Fix:
- Remove the unnecessary double quotes around the property value when constructing the command list.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, '{0}={1}'.format(prop, val)]
    return command
```

By making this change, the function will correctly format the command list without adding unnecessary double quotes around the property values. This correction should resolve the assertion errors in the failing test cases.
