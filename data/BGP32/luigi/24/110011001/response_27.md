The bug in the `_dict_arg` function arises from the fact that the function encloses the values of the dictionary in double quotes (`"`), resulting in an incorrect format when constructing the command list.

### Bug Explanation:
1. In Case 1, the input dictionary value is `{'Prop': 'Value'}`. When processing this dictionary, the function erroneously adds double quotes around the value, resulting in `'"Prop=Value"'`.
2. In Case 2, a similar issue occurs where the input dictionary value is `{'prop1': 'val1'}`, but the function adds double quotes around the value, leading to `'"prop1=val1"'`.

Adding double quotes around the dictionary values is unnecessary and leads to discrepancies when comparing the expected command list in the test cases.

### Fix Strategy:
To resolve the bug, we need to modify the `_dict_arg` function to construct the command list without encapsulating the values in double quotes.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, prop_value in value.items():
            command += [name, '{0}={1}'.format(prop, prop_value)]
    return command
```

By removing the unnecessary double quotes when constructing the command list, the corrected version of the function should now generate the expected command list without issues.
