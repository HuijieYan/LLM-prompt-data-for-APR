### Explanation:
The bug in the `_dict_arg` function is caused by adding unnecessary double quotes around the property value when constructing the command list. This is evident from the error messages where the comparison fails due to the presence of double quotes in the expected output but not in the actual output.

### Strategy for fixing the bug:
To fix the bug, we need to remove the unnecessary double quotes when formatting the property-value pair in the command list. The function should directly add the property and its value without encapsulating them in double quotes.

### Corrected Version of the `_dict_arg` function:
```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, prop_value in value.items():
            command += [name, '{0}={1}'.format(prop, prop_value)]
    return command
``` 

By making this change, the corrected version of the function should remove the double quotes issue and make it consistent with the expected output in the failing tests.
