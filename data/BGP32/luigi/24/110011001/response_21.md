### Analysis
In the provided buggy function `_dict_arg`, the function is meant to create a list of command arguments from a dictionary input. However, the bug lies in the way the values from the dictionary are being formatted. The function incorrectly adds double quotes around the property values, causing a mismatch in the expected output during the test cases.

### Bug
The bug stems from formatting the dictionary values with double quotes, which is unnecessary and causes the test cases to fail when comparing the expected command list with the actual command list.

### Fix
To fix the bug, we need to remove the unnecessary double quotes around the property values when constructing the command list.

### Corrected Version
```python
class SparkSubmitTask(luigi.Task):
    def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
        command = []
        if value and isinstance(value, dict):
            for prop, val in value.items():
                command += [name, "{0}={1}".format(prop, val)]
        return command
```

By making this change, the corrected function will properly format the command arguments without unnecessary double quotes, aligning with the expected output in the test cases.
