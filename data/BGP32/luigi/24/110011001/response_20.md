### Bug Analysis
The bug in the `_dict_arg` function arises from the way the function handles dictionary values when constructing the `command` list. The function checks if the input `value` is a dictionary and then attempts to iterate over the key-value pairs to construct the command. However, the issue lies with how the key-value pairs are being handled, particularly the use of double quotes in formatting the key-value pair.

In Case 1, the function incorrectly adds double quotes around the property and value when constructing the command list, resulting in the mismatch between the expected and actual output.

In Case 2, a similar issue occurs where the function encloses the entire key-value pair in double quotes, leading to incorrect formatting of the command list.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to remove the unnecessary double quotes around the property and value pairs when constructing the `command` list. This will ensure that the command list is formatted correctly and matches the expected output.

### Corrected Version
```python
class SparkSubmitTask(luigi.Task):
    def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
        command = []
        if value and isinstance(value, dict):
            for prop, val in value.items():  # Renamed value to val
                command += [name, '{0}={1}'.format(prop, val)]  # Removed unnecessary double quotes
        return command
```

By implementing the corrected version of the `_dict_arg` function as described above, the bug should be fixed, and the failing tests should pass successfully.
