### Analysis
The buggy function `_dict_arg` is designed to construct a list of command-line arguments based on the input dictionary `value`. The primary issue in this function is the incorrect handling of dictionary values when constructing the command list. The function mistakenly wraps the dictionary values in double quotes, causing a mismatch in the expected and actual command lists in the test cases.

### Potential Error Locations
1. The function incorrectly formats the dictionary values with double quotes.
2. The function does not handle dictionary key-value pairs correctly.

### Cause of the Bug
The bug arises from how the function constructs the command list. It incorrectly formats dictionary values with double quotes, making the command elements in the list not match the expected values. This discrepancy causes the equality check in the test cases to fail.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug
To fix the bug, we need to update the `_dict_arg` function to correctly handle dictionary key-value pairs and ensure that the command list elements are formatted without unnecessary double quotes.

### Corrected Version of the Function
```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, '{0}={1}'.format(prop, val)]
    return command
```

By making the above correction in the function, we ensure that the dictionary key-value pairs are added to the command list without wrapping the values in double quotes. This adjustment should resolve the discrepancies in the test cases.
