### Analysis
- The function `_dict_arg` is supposed to take a name and a dictionary as input, iterate over the dictionary key-value pairs, and construct a list of strings to be used as command arguments.
- The bug seems to be related to how the key-value pairs from the dictionary are formatted when added to the command list.
- The function is currently enclosing the key-value pairs within double quotes, resulting in a mismatch when compared to the expected command list.

### Bug Explanation
- In the first case, the value `"prop1=val1"` is enclosed in double quotes when added to the command list, causing the assertion error when compared to the expected list.
- In the second case, a similar issue occurs with the value `"Prop=Value"` being within quotes in the command list.

### Bug Fix
- The bug can be fixed by removing the unnecessary double quotes when constructing the key-value pair strings for the command list.

### Corrected Version
```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, '{0}={1}'.format(prop, val)]
    return command
``` 

After making this change, re-run the failing tests to ensure that the corrected version passes.
