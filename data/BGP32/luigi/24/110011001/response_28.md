The issue in the buggy function `_dict_arg` is due to the unnecessary addition of double quotes around the property value when constructing the command list. This extra quoting causes the assertion errors in the failing tests since the expected output does not contain the quotes.

To fix this bug, we need to remove the unnecessary quoting of the property value when constructing the command list.

Here is the corrected version of the `_dict_arg` function:

```python
# The corrected version of the function
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, '{0}={1}'.format(prop, val)]
    return command
```

By removing the unnecessary double quotes around the property value, the function will construct the command list correctly, and the failing tests should pass without any assertion errors.
