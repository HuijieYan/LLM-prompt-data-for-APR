The bug in the `_dict_arg` function is related to how the dictionary key-value pairs are processed. The code currently wraps the values in the dictionary in double quotes, resulting in a mismatch when comparing the expected command list with the actual generated command list.

The root cause of the bug is that the function incorrectly wraps the dictionary values in double quotes in the command list. This leads to a mismatch in the comparison with the expected command list, which does not have the values wrapped in double quotes.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the `_dict_arg` function to properly format the key-value pairs without wrapping the values in double quotes.

Here is the corrected version of the `_dict_arg` function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, '{0}={1}'.format(prop, val)]
    return command
```

By modifying the command concatenation line to use `'{0}={1}'.format(prop, val)` instead of `'{0}="{1}"'.format(prop, value)`, we ensure that the values in the dictionary are not wrapped in double quotes.

This correction should address the bug and make the function behave as expected, passing the failing tests provided.
