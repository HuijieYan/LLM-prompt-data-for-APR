### Bug Explanation
The bug in the `_dict_arg` function lies in the way it constructs the `command` list when iterating over the key-value pairs in the input dictionary. The function currently incorrectly wraps the property value in double quotes, resulting in a mismatch when comparing the expected command list with the generated one. This is evident from the difference between `'"Prop=Value"'` and `'Prop=Value'` in the error messages.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to modify the way the property and value are formatted when constructing the command list. We should remove the unnecessary double quotes around the property and value pair strings.

### Corrected Version of the Function
```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, '{0}={1}'.format(prop, val)]
    return command
```

By making this change, we ensure that the generated command list matches the expected format without unnecessary double quotes, resolving the failing test cases.
