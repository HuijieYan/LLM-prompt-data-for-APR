### Bug Explanation
The bug in the `_dict_arg` function is caused by the incorrect formatting of dictionary key-value pairs when constructing the command list. Currently, the function is enclosing the property values within double quotes, which causes a mismatch when comparing the command list in the test cases, resulting in assertion errors.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to modify the `_dict_arg` function to correctly format the key-value pairs without enclosing the property values in double quotes. This will ensure that the command list is constructed properly and matches the expected output in the test cases.

### Corrected Version of the Function
Here is the corrected version of the `_dict_arg` function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, prop_value in value.items():
            command += [name, '{0}={1}'.format(prop, prop_value)]
    return command
```

By making this change, the function will now properly format the dictionary key-value pairs without using double quotes, addressing the bug and allowing the test cases to pass successfully.
