The bug in the `_dict_arg` function is caused by incorrectly handling the dictionary input `value` and formatting the output `command`. The function is currently adding unnecessary double quotes around each key-value pair in the command list.

To fix the bug, we need to remove the unnecessary double quotes around the key-value pairs when constructing the command list.

Here is the corrected version of the `_dict_arg` function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, '{0}={1}'.format(prop, val)]
    return command
```

With this correction, the function should now pass the failing tests and return the expected output values correctly.
