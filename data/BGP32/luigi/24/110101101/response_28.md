### Analysis:
The buggy function `_dict_arg` is designed to take a `name` and a `value` parameter, where the `value` is expected to be a dictionary. The function then iterates over the dictionary items and constructs a list of command arguments based on the key-value pairs in the dictionary.

The bug in the function lies in the way the key-value pairs are being formatted into the command list. The current implementation adds extra double quotes around the key-value pairs, which leads to incorrect formatting of the command arguments.

### Bug:
The bug in the function is caused by adding unnecessary double quotes around the key-value pairs when constructing the command list.

### Fix:
Modify the code to remove the unnecessary double quotes when constructing the command list.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, "{0}={1}".format(prop, val)]
    return command
```

By making this change, the corrected version of the function will properly format the key-value pairs without unnecessary double quotes and should pass the failing tests.
