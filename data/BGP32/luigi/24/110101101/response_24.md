### Analysis:
The buggy function `_dict_arg` is intended to convert a dictionary into a list of command-line arguments. However, it is incorrectly adding extra quotes around the property values, resulting in incorrect command generation.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is caused by the buggy function adding quotes around the property values while formatting the command. This leads to an incorrect command when constructing the list of arguments.

### Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to remove the quotes around property values while constructing the command list in the `_dict_arg` function.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, '{0}={1}'.format(prop, val)]
    return command
```

With this corrected version, the function should now correctly generate the command list without unnecessary quotes around property values. This fix will make the function pass the failing test cases.
