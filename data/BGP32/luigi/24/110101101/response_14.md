The bug in the `_dict_arg` function is caused by adding unnecessary double quotes around the key-value pairs when constructing the `command` list. This causes the failing tests to expect a different format of the output.

To fix the bug, we need to remove the unnecessary double quotes when formatting the key-value pairs in the `command` list.

Here is the corrected version of the `_dict_arg` function:

```python
# The corrected version of the function
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, '{0}={1}'.format(prop, val)]
    return command
```

With this correction, the function will now format the key-value pairs correctly without unnecessary double quotes, satisfying the expected input/output values for the failing tests.
