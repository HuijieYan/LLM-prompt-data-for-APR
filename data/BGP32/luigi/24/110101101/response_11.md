The bug in the `_dict_arg` function lies in the way the key-value pairs are being formatted when adding them to the `command` list. The current implementation wraps the key-value pairs in double quotes, which is not required and causes the test cases to fail.

To fix this bug, we need to remove the double quotes around the formatted key-value pairs. Here is the corrected version of the `_dict_arg` function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, '{0}={1}'.format(prop, val)]
    return command
```

By removing the unnecessary double quotes, the function will correctly generate the list of key-value pairs without causing issues with the test cases. This corrected version should pass the failing tests and produce the expected output.
