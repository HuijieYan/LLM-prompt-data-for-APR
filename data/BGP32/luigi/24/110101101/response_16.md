The bug in the `_dict_arg` function is that it mistakenly adds extra quotes around the key-value pairs when constructing the command list. This causes the test cases to fail as they expect the key-value pairs to be without quotes.

To fix the bug, we need to remove the unnecessary quotes around the key-value pairs in the `command` list. Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, "{0}={1}".format(prop, val)]
    return command
```

With this correction, the function should now pass both failing test cases with the expected values. The function will correctly construct the command list without additional quotes around the key-value pairs.
