The issue in the buggy function `_dict_arg` is the incorrect format of adding key-value pairs to the `command` list. The function is currently using double quotes around the key-value pairs, which is causing the test cases to fail.

To fix this, we need to remove the double quotes around the key-value pairs when forming the command list.

Here is the corrected version of the `_dict_arg` function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, prop_value in value.items():
            command += [name, '{0}={1}'.format(prop, prop_value)]
    return command
```

With this correction, the function will correctly format the key-value pairs without using unnecessary double quotes. This will ensure that the test cases pass successfully and the expected input/output values are satisfied.
