The bug in the `_dict_arg` function is caused by incorrectly adding double quotes around property-value pairs in the command list.

The strategy for fixing this bug is to remove the double quotes when formatting the property-value pairs.

Here is the corrected version of the `_dict_arg` function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, '{0}={1}'.format(prop, val)]
    return command
```

With this correction, the function should now produce the expected output and pass the failing tests.
