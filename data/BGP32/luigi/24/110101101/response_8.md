### Bug Explanation
The bug in the `_dict_arg` function is due to the way the command list is being constructed when iterating over the dictionary items. The issue lies in the line `command += [name, '"{0}={1}"'.format(prop, value)]`, where the `value` variable is being overwritten within the loop. As a result, the constructed command list does not correctly represent the key-value pairs from the input dictionary.

### Fix Strategy
To fix this bug, we need to change the variable name inside the loop from `value` to something else to avoid overwriting the original `value` parameter. This will ensure that each key-value pair from the input dictionary is correctly added to the command list in the format `'prop=value'`.

### Corrected Version
```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():  # fixed variable name from `value` to `val`
            command += [name, '"{0}={1}"'.format(prop, val)]
    return command
``` 

After making this change, the `_dict_arg` function should now correctly construct the command list with the key-value pairs from the input dictionary, satisfying the expected input/output values for the failing tests.
