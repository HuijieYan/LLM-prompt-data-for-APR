The bug in the `_dict_arg` function is caused by adding quotation marks around the value `"={}"` in the `command += [name, '"{0}={1}"'.format(prop, value)]` line. This results in the value being treated as a single string rather than separate elements in the list.

To fix this bug, we need to remove the unnecessary quotation marks around the `{0}={1}` part in the formatting. This will ensure that each key-value pair is added to the command list as separate elements.

Here is the corrected version of the `_dict_arg` function:

```python
# The corrected version of the _dict_arg function
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, "{0}={1}".format(prop, val)]
    return command
```

By making this change, the function will correctly generate a list with key-value pairs separated by `=` and without unnecessary quotation marks.

This corrected version should pass the failing test cases provided.
