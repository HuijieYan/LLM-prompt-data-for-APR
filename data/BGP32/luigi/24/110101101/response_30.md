The bug in the `_dict_arg` function is caused by adding unnecessary double quotes around the properties and values when constructing the command list. This leads to incorrect formatting of the arguments passed to the subprocess module, causing the failing tests.

To fix this bug, you should remove the unnecessary double quotes around the properties and values in the command list construction.

Here is the corrected version of the `_dict_arg` function:

```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: luigi/contrib/spark.py

# The declaration of the class containing the buggy function
class SparkSubmitTask(luigi.Task):
    """
    Template task for running a Spark job
    
    Supports running jobs on Spark local, standalone, Mesos or Yarn
    
    See http://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/submitting-applications.html
    for more information
    """

    def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
        command = []
        if value and isinstance(value, dict):
            for prop, val in value.items():  # Changed variable name from value to val here
                command += [name, '{0}={1}'.format(prop, val)]  # Removed unnecessary double quotes
        return command
```

Now the corrected function will construct the command list without unnecessary double quotes, which should align with the expected input/output values provided in the failing tests. The corrected function should now pass the failing tests.
