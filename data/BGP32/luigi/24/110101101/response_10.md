Potential error locations:
1. The function is incorrectly formatting the dictionary values into string format with double quotes around them, causing the command list to have unnecessary quotes.
2. The function is not correctly parsing the key-value pairs from the input dictionary.

Cause of the bug:
The bug is caused by the incorrect formatting of the dictionary key-value pairs into strings. The function adds unnecessary double quotes around the values, leading to incorrect command creation.

Strategy for fixing the bug:
1. Iterate over the dictionary items correctly to separate keys and values.
2. Construct the command list by directly joining the key and value pairs without unnecessary quotes.

```python
# Corrected version of the _dict_arg function
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, "{0}={1}".format(prop, val)]
    return command
```
