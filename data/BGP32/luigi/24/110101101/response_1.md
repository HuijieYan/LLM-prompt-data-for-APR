### Explanation:
The bug in the `_dict_arg` function lies in the way it constructs the command list. The function incorrectly wraps the property and value in double quotes when forming the string element to append to the `command` list. This results in an additional unwanted level of quotes in the output command list.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to remove the unnecessary double quotes around the property and value when constructing the string to append to the `command` list. This will ensure that the output command list is correctly formatted without additional quotes.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, "{0}={1}".format(prop, val)]  # Fixed formatting without unnecessary double quotes
    return command
``` 

By making this change, the function will correctly construct the command list without adding extra quotes, ensuring that it matches the expected values and types during the failing test execution.
