## Bug Explanation
The buggy function `_dict_arg` is intended to take a dictionary as input and convert it into a list of command arguments. However, the bug lies in how the function constructs the command list using the input dictionary. The function incorrectly formats the key-value pairs in the dictionary as strings within double quotes, causing issues when the command is executed in the test cases.

## Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug in the `_dict_arg` function, we need to ensure that the key-value pairs are added to the command list in the correct format without unnecessary double quotes around the values.

## Corrected Version of the Function
```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, '{0}={1}'.format(prop, val)]
    return command
```

By making the proposed correction, the function will construct the command list with key-value pairs in the format expected by the test cases. This change should address the bug and make the function behave as intended.
