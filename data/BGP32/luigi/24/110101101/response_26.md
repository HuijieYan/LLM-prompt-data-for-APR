The bug in the `_dict_arg` function lies in how the key-value pairs from the input dictionary are formatted into the `command` list. The current implementation wraps both the property and its value in double quotes, which is unnecessary and causing the failing tests.

The correct strategy to fix the bug is to remove the unnecessary double quotes around the property=value pairs when constructing the command list inside the loop.

Here is the corrected version of the `_dict_arg` function:

```python
# The corrected version of the buggy function
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, "{0}={1}".format(prop, val)]
    return command
```

By making this adjustment, the function will correctly format the key-value pairs without unnecessary double quotes, which should now pass the failing tests and match the expected input/output values.
