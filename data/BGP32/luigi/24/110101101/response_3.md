The issue in the buggy function `_dict_arg` is that it incorrectly formats the key-value pairs in the dictionary `value` when constructing the command list. It is adding double quotes around the entire key-value pair, which is not necessary.

### Cause of the Bug
The bug is caused by the incorrect formatting of the key-value pairs in the dictionary `value`. The function adds unnecessary double quotes around the entire key-value pair, causing the test cases to fail as they expect a different format.

### Fixing the Bug
To fix the bug, we need to remove the unnecessary double quotes when constructing the command list by directly appending the key-value pair without additional quotes.

### Corrected Version of the Function
```python
class SparkSubmitTask(luigi.Task):

    def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
        command = []
        if value and isinstance(value, dict):
            for prop, val in value.items():
                command += [name, '{0}={1}'.format(prop, val)]
        return command
```

By using the corrected version of the `_dict_arg` function, it will now construct the command list correctly by directly appending the key-value pairs without additional quotes. This should fix the bugs in the failing tests.
