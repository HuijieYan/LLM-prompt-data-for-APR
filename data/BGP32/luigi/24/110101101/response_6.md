The bug in the `_dict_arg` function is caused by incorrectly formatting the key-value pairs from the input dictionary as strings with double quotes. This leads to the test cases failing as the expected output does not include quotes around the key-value pairs.

To fix this bug, we need to remove the double quotes around the formatted key-value pairs in the `command` list.

Here is the corrected version of the `_dict_arg` function:

```python
class SparkSubmitTask(luigi.Task):
    def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
        command = []
        if value and isinstance(value, dict):
            for prop, value in value.items():
                command += [name, "{0}={1}".format(prop, value)]
        return command
```

With this correction, the function will now generate the expected output without unnecessary double quotes around the key-value pairs, which should make the failing tests pass successfully.
