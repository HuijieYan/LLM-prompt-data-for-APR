The bug in the `_dict_arg` function arises from how the dictionary values are being formatted into the command list. The current implementation wraps the values in double quotes which is not necessary and causing the test cases to fail.

To fix this issue, we need to remove the unnecessary double quotes when constructing the command list. Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, '{0}={1}'.format(prop, val)]
    return command
```

By updating the function to remove the double quotes around the `{prop}={val}` format, the function should now correctly generate the command list without unnecessary quoting. This will align with the expected input/output values provided in the test cases.
