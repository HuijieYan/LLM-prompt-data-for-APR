The bug in the `_dict_arg` function lies in the way the key-value pairs from the input dictionary are being formatted and added to the command list. The current implementation adds extra double quotes around the key-value pairs, resulting in incorrect command generation.

To fix this bug, we need to remove the unnecessary double quotes around the key-value pairs when formatting them. This will ensure that the command list is constructed correctly.

Here is the corrected version of the `_dict_arg` function:

```python
    def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
        command = []
        if value and isinstance(value, dict):
            for prop, value in value.items():
                command += [name, '{0}={1}'.format(prop, value)]
        return command
```

With this correction, the function should now properly construct the command list without including unnecessary double quotes.

The corrected function should pass the failing tests by correctly formatting the key-value pairs from the input dictionary.

If for some reason the issue persists, further debugging may be required to identify any other potential problems in the test setup or class inheritance.
