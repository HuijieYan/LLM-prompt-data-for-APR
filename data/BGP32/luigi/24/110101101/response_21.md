The bug in the `_dict_arg` function is caused by incorrectly formatting the dictionary key-value pairs into a string in the command list. The current implementation adds double quotes around the key-value pairs which is not necessary.

To fix the bug, the function should directly append the key and value without additional formatting.

Here is the corrected version of the `_dict_arg` function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, "{0}={1}".format(prop, val)]
    return command
```

This updated implementation removes the unnecessary double quotes around the key-value pairs in the command list. This will now correctly format the arguments and pass the failing tests.
