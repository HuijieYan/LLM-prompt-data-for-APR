The bug in the `_dict_arg` function arises from the way the dictionary key-value pairs are being formatted into strings. The current implementation adds unnecessary double quotes around the key-value pairs, resulting in incorrect command formation.

To fix this bug, we need to remove the unnecessary double quotes when formatting the key-value pairs. The corrected version of the `_dict_arg` function is provided below:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, '{0}={1}'.format(prop, val)]
    return command
```

By removing the double quotes from `"{0}={1}"`, we are now correctly formatting the key-value pairs without unwanted characters.

This corrected version should now pass the failing tests and correctly format the command list as expected.
