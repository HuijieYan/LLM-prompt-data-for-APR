### Bug Explanation
The bug in the `_dict_arg` function is caused by incorrectly formatting the dictionary key-value pairs when constructing the `command` list. The current implementation adds double quotes around the key-value pairs, resulting in an incorrect format. This leads to the failing test cases as the expected output does not match the actual output due to this formatting issue.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to remove the unnecessary double quotes around the key-value pairs in the command list. This can be achieved by directly appending the key-value pairs without extra quotes when constructing the `command` list.

### Corrected Version of the Function
```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, '{0}={1}'.format(prop, val)]
    return command
```

By making this change, the function now correctly constructs the command list with the key-value pairs in the expected format without unnecessary quotes. This corrected version should now pass the failing test cases.
