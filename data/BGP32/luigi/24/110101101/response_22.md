The bug in the `_dict_arg` function is related to how the command list is being constructed. The current implementation adds double quotes around the key-value pairs, which is incorrect based on the expected output values provided. The corrected version should remove the unnecessary double quotes.

Here is the corrected version of the `_dict_arg` function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, '{0}={1}'.format(prop, val)]
    return command
```

By removing the double quotes around the key-value pairs, the function should now correctly generate the command list as expected in the failing tests, which will allow the tests to pass.
