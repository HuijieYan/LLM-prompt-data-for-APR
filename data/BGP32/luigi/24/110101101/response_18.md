The bug in the `_dict_arg` function is due to the incorrect formatting of the dictionary key-value pairs when constructing the command list. The function is erroneously adding double quotes around the key-value pairs, leading to a mismatch between the expected and actual command list.

To fix this bug, we need to remove the unnecessary double quotes around the key-value pairs in the command list.

Here is the corrected version of the `_dict_arg` function:

```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: luigi/contrib/spark.py

# The declaration of the class containing the buggy function
class SparkSubmitTask(luigi.Task):
    """
    Template task for running a Spark job
    
    Supports running jobs on Spark local, standalone, Mesos or Yarn
    
    See http://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/submitting-applications.html
    for more information
    """

    def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
        command = []
        if value and isinstance(value, dict):
            for prop, value in value.items():
                command += [name, '{0}={1}'.format(prop, value)]
        return command
```

With this correction, the function will now correctly construct the command list without unnecessary double quotes around the key-value pairs, making it consistent with the expected output values provided in the failing test cases.
