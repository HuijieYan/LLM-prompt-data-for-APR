After analyzing the buggy function and the failing tests, it seems that the issue lies in how the command list is constructed within the `_dict_arg` function. The current implementation is incorrectly adding extra double quotes around key-value pairs and not handling them properly, leading to the failing tests.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the `_dict_arg` function to correctly construct the command list without unnecessary quotes. We should format the key-value pairs directly without surrounding them with additional quotes.

Here's the corrected version of the `_dict_arg` function:

```python
class SparkSubmitTask(luigi.Task):
    def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
        command = []
        if value and isinstance(value, dict):
            for prop, value in value.items():
                command += [name, '{0}={1}'.format(prop, value)]
        return command
```

This modified version will correctly format the key-value pairs without unnecessary quotes, which should make the tests pass with the expected outcomes.
