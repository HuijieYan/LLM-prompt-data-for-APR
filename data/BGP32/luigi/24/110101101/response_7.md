The bug in the `_dict_arg` function stems from incorrectly formatting the dictionary items into a list of strings. The current implementation adds unnecessary quotation marks around the key-value pairs. To fix this bug, we need to remove the unnecessary quotes when constructing the command list.

Here is the corrected version of the `_dict_arg` function:

```python
class SparkSubmitTask(luigi.Task):
    def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
        command = []
        if value and isinstance(value, dict):
            for prop, val in value.items():  # Changing variable name 'value' to 'val'
                command += [name, '{0}={1}'.format(prop, val)]  # Removing unnecessary quotes
        return command
```

By removing the unnecessary quotes around the key-value pairs, the function now correctly formats the dictionary items into a list of strings. This should make the function pass the failing tests, satisfying the expected input/output values provided.
