### Analysis:
1. The `_dict_arg` function takes a name and a value as input, where the value is expected to be a dictionary. It iterates over the items in the dictionary and constructs a command list.
2. The bug seems to be related to how the command list is constructed using the properties and values in the dictionary.
3. The bug occurs because the original implementation incorrectly quotes the key=value pairs in the command list, causing the test cases to fail.
4. To fix the bug, we need to remove the unnecessary quotes around the key=value pairs when constructing the command list.

### Updated Corrected Version:
```python
class SparkSubmitTask(luigi.Task):
    def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
        command = []
        if value and isinstance(value, dict):
            for prop, val in value.items():
                command += [name, '{0}={1}'.format(prop, val)]
        return command
```

By removing the double quotes around `{0}={1}`, the command list will be constructed correctly with key=value pairs without any additional quoting. This corrected version should now pass the failing test cases and output the expected command lists.
