Based on the information provided, it appears that the issue lies in how the values are being added to the `command` list in the `_dict_arg` function. In the current implementation, the values are being enclosed in double quotes, which is causing the comparison to fail with the expected values.

To fix this issue, we need to remove the double quotes when adding the key-value pair to the `command` list. Below is the corrected version of the `_dict_arg` function:

```python
# The corrected version of the buggy function
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, '{0}={1}'.format(prop, val)]  # Remove double quotes here
    return command
```

With this correction, the function should now handle the dictionary values correctly without enclosing them in double quotes. This change should align the output of the function with the expected values from the failing test cases.
