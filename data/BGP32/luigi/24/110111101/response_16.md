## Bug Analysis:
1. The bug occurs in the `_dict_arg` function where it incorrectly formats dictionary key-value pairs into a list of strings. The bug manifests in failing tests where dictionary values are not correctly formatted.
2. The cause of the bug is that the function incorrectly surrounds property values with double quotes, resulting in a mismatch in the list comparison during tests.
3. This causes the failing tests to detect a discrepancy in the formatting of dictionary values, leading to assertion errors.
4. To fix the bug, we need to remove the unnecessary double quotes around the property values in the list construction to match the expected output.
5. The corrected version of the function is provided below.

## Corrected Function:
```python
class SparkSubmitTask(luigi.Task):
    def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
        command = []
        if value and isinstance(value, dict):
            for prop, val in value.items():
                command += [name, '{0}={1}'.format(prop, val)]  # Removed unnecessary double quotes
        return command
```

By making this change, the function will correctly format the dictionary key-value pairs without additional double quotes, resolving the failing tests and ensuring the expected output matches the actual output.
