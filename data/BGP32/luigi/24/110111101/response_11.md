Based on the analysis, the bug in the `_dict_arg` function is caused by the unnecessary use of double quotes around the value when constructing the command list. The expected format in the command list is `'Prop=Value'`, not `'"Prop=Value"'`.

To fix the bug, we need to remove the unnecessary double quotes around the value in the `command` list. Here is the corrected version of the `_dict_arg` function:

```python
# The corrected version of the buggy function
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, '{0}={1}'.format(prop, val)]
    return command
```

This corrected version of the function should now construct the command list in the expected format without unnecessary double quotes around the values.

Make sure to run the failing test cases again to ensure that the corrected function resolves the issues and passes all the tests.
