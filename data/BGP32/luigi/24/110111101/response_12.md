## Bug Explanation
The bug in the `_dict_arg` function arises from incorrectly formatting the dictionary values when constructing the command list. The current implementation adds double quotes around the value, which causes discrepancies when comparing the expected list with the actual list in the test cases. The expected output does not contain quotes around the property-value pairs in the command list.

## Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to remove the double quotes around the property-value pairs in the command list formed from the dictionary. This will align the output format with the expected format in the test cases and eliminate the assertion errors.

## Corrected Version
```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, '{0}={1}'.format(prop, val)]
    return command
```

By removing the double quotes when constructing the command list, the corrected function will format the dictionary values correctly and produce the expected command list without the quoting issues.
