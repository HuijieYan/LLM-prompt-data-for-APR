## Bug Explanation
The bug in the `_dict_arg` function is caused by erroneously adding double quotes around the property values when constructing the command list. The function incorrectly appends `"{0}={1}".format(prop, value)` with double quotes around the value part, leading to a mismatch with the expected output in the test cases.

## Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to remove the double quotes while formatting the property-value pair in the command list construction.

## Corrected Version
```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            # Remove double quotes around the value part
            command += [name, '{0}={1}'.format(prop, val)]
    return command
``` 

By removing the double quotes around the `{1}` in the formatting part, we ensure that the property-value pairs are constructed correctly without any extra quotes. This correction should resolve the issue and make the function pass the failing tests.
