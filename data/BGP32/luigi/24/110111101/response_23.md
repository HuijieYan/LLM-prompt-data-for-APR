#### Bug Explanation:
The bug in the `_dict_arg` function stems from the use of double quotes around the property value in the command list. The function is incorrectly enclosing the property values in double quotes, causing a mismatch with the expected values in the test cases. The property values should not be enclosed in quotes in the final command list.

#### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to remove the unnecessary double quotes around the values when constructing the command list. By doing so, the function will correctly format the command list elements according to the expected values.

#### Corrected Version of the Buggy Function:
```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, prop_value in value.items():
            command += [name, "{0}={1}".format(prop, prop_value)]  # Remove unnecessary quotes
    return command
``` 

By making this adjustment in the function, it will correctly build the command list without enclosing the property values in double quotes, ensuring alignment with the expected values in the test cases.
