## Bug Explanation
The bug in the `_dict_arg` function lies in how it handles dictionary values when constructing the `command` list. Currently, it wraps the dictionary values in double quotes (`"`) but the test cases expect the dictionary values to be without quotes. This causes a mismatch in the expected and actual command list, leading to test failures.

## Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to modify the `_dict_arg` function to avoid wrapping dictionary values in double quotes. This can be achieved by directly appending the property and its value without quotes to the `command` list.

## Corrected Function
```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, '{0}={1}'.format(prop, val)]
    return command
``` 

By making this change, we ensure that the values from the dictionary are added to the `command` list without quotes, matching the expected behavior in the test cases.
