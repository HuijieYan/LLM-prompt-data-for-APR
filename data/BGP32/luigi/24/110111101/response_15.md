## Bug Fix Strategy
The bug arises due to an unnecessary quotation mark around the property value when constructing the command list. To fix this issue, we need to remove the unnecessary quotation marks around the property value before appending it to the command list.

## Corrected Version of the Buggy Function

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, '{0}={1}'.format(prop, val)]
    return command
``` 

By removing the unnecessary quotation marks in the `'{0}={1}'.format(prop, val)` expression, we ensure that the property value is correctly formatted without additional quotes. This corrected version should now pass the failing tests and provide the expected output values.
