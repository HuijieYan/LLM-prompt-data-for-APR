## Bug Explanation

The bug lies in the `_dict_arg` function where it adds quotation marks around the key-value pair for dictionary items, causing the test cases to fail when comparing the expected output with the actual output. The test cases expect the key-value pairs in the command list without any quotation marks. The function is incorrectly formatting the dictionary values with quotation marks, leading to the assertion errors in the tests.

## Bug Fix Strategy

To fix the bug, we need to modify the `_dict_arg` function to construct the command list without enclosing the key-value pairs in quotation marks. This way, the command list will match the expected values in the test cases.

## The corrected version of the `_dict_arg` function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, "{0}={1}".format(prop, val)]
    return command
```

By removing the quotation marks around the key-value pairs, the corrected function will construct the command list correctly, allowing it to pass the failing test cases.
