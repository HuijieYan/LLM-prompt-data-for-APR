The bug in the `_dict_arg` function is related to the way the dictionary key-value pairs are being converted into strings in the `command` list. The buggy function is wrapping the values in double quotes, causing the test cases to fail as the expected output does not have double quotes around the values.

To fix this bug, we need to adjust how the key-value pairs are formatted when adding them to the `command` list. We should remove the unnecessary double quotes around the values.

```python
class SparkSubmitTask(luigi.Task):
    def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
        command = []
        if value and isinstance(value, dict):
            for prop, val in value.items():
                command += [name, '{0}={1}'.format(prop, val)]
        return command
```

By modifying the string formatting in the `command` list to remove double quotes around the values, the function should now correctly handle dictionary key-value pairs and provide the expected output for the failing test cases.
