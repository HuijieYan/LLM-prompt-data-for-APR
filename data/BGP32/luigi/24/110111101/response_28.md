The bug in the `_dict_arg` function arises from the unnecessary double-quoting of the property and value pairs in the command list when constructing the command for submission. This leads to a mismatch between the expected and actual output in the failing tests.

To fix the bug, we need to remove the double-quoting around the property and value pairs in the construction of the command list.

Here is the corrected version of the `_dict_arg` function:

```python
    def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
        command = []
        if value and isinstance(value, dict):
            for prop, val in value.items():
                command += [name, '{0}={1}'.format(prop, val)]
        return command
```

By making this change, the function will correctly construct the command list without adding unnecessary double-quoting. This correction should ensure that the failing tests pass and the expected input/output values match.
