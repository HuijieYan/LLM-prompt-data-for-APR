The bug in the `_dict_arg` function is due to incorrectly formatting the dictionary key-value pairs into a list of strings.

The issue arises from adding quotes around the key-value pairs in the command list, which causes the test cases to fail as the expected command lists do not contain quotes around the property values.

To fix this bug, we should remove the quotes around the key-value pairs in the command list.

Here is the corrected version of the `_dict_arg` function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, '{0}={1}'.format(prop, val)]
    return command
```

This corrected version should now correctly format the key-value pairs without unnecessary quotes, satisfying the expected input/output values and passing the failing tests.
