The bug in the `_dict_arg` function is related to how the dictionary key-value pairs are formatted when constructing the command list. The current implementation unnecessarily wraps the values in double quotes, causing a mismatch with the expected values.

To fix this bug, we need to remove the unnecessary double quotes when formatting the key-value pairs in the command list.

Here is the corrected version of the `_dict_arg` function:

```python
    def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
        command = []
        if value and isinstance(value, dict):
            for prop, val in value.items():  # Renamed variable to avoid conflict with value
                command += [name, '{0}={1}'.format(prop, val)]  # Removed unnecessary double quotes
        return command
```

With this correction, the function will properly format the command list without the extra double quotes, aligning it with the expected values as defined in the failing tests.
