The bug in the `_dict_arg` function arises from improperly formatting the dictionary entries as string elements within a list. The function is incorrectly adding double quotes around the property values, causing a mismatch with the expected format.

To fix this bug, the function needs to adjust how it constructs the command list when iterating over the dictionary items.

Here is the corrected version of the `_dict_arg` function:
```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, '{0}={1}'.format(prop, val)]  # Correctly construct the key-value pair
    return command
```

With this correction, the function will properly format the dictionary entries without adding double quotes around the property values. This should address the failing tests and align the function's output with the expected values.
