### Bug Explanation:

The bug is caused by the buggy function `_dict_arg` incorrectly formatting the dictionary values before adding them to the command list. The function wraps the property and value with double quotes, resulting in a mismatch with the expected output. 

In the failing tests, the function is expected to return a command list with values in the format `'prop=value'`, but it is currently returning them in the format `'"prop=value"'`. This mismatch causes the assertion errors in the tests.

### Bug Fix Strategy:

To fix the bug, we need to modify the `_dict_arg` function to correctly format the property and value pairs without wrapping them in double quotes. By removing the unnecessary double quotes during concatenation, we can ensure the generated command list matches the expected format.

### Corrected Version of the Function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, '{0}={1}'.format(prop, val)]
    return command
```

With this corrected version, the function will properly construct the command list with property-value pairs in the expected format, resolving the issues in the failing tests.
