## Correction

The bug in the `_dict_arg` function arises from the unnecessary use of double quotes around the property value when constructing the `command` list. To fix this issue, we should remove the double quotes from around the `prop=value` format string in the `command` list.

Here is the corrected version of the `_dict_arg` function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, "{0}={1}".format(prop, val)]
    return command
```

By making this change, the constructed `command` list will contain the properties in the correct format without unnecessary double quotes.

This correction should resolve the failing tests and produce the expected output values.
