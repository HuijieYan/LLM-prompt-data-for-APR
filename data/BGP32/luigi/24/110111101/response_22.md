Based on the analysis, the bug in the `_dict_arg` function arises from the unnecessary double-quoting of the property values in the command list. The function should construct the command list without enclosing the property values in quotes.

Here is the corrected version of the `_dict_arg` function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, '{0}={1}'.format(prop, val)]
    return command
```

By removing the unnecessary double-quotes around the property values, the corrected function will now build the command list correctly. This fix should address the failing tests where comparisons are made between the expected and actual command lists.
