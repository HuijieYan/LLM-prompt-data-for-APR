The bug in the `_dict_arg` function stems from quoting the values in the `command` list. The expectation in the test cases is that the values should not be quoted, but the buggy function adds double quotes around the values. This causes the test cases to fail as the values in the lists do not match the expected values.

To fix the bug, we need to remove the double quotes around the values when constructing the `command` list.

Here is the corrected version of the `_dict_arg` function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, '{0}={1}'.format(prop, val)]
    return command
```

By removing the double quotes around the values when building the `command` list, the function should now correctly construct the command list without unnecessary quoting. This fix should make the function pass the failing test cases provided.
