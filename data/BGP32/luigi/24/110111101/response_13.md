After analyzing the buggy function `_dict_arg`, we can identify the issue causing the failing tests. The problem lies in how the properties are added to the `command` list. Currently, the properties are being enclosed in double quotes, which is causing the mismatch compared to the expected output.

To fix the bug, we need to remove the unnecessary double quotes around the property-value pairs when appending them to the `command` list.

Here is the corrected version of the `_dict_arg` function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, '{0}={1}'.format(prop, val)]
    return command
```

This corrected version removes the double quotes and formats the property-value pairs directly without unnecessary string manipulation. This change aligns the function's behavior with the expected output, resolving the failing tests.
