## Bug Explanation
The bug in the `_dict_arg` function arises from incorrectly formatting the dictionary values when creating the `command` list. The function mistakenly wraps the property and value pairs in double quotes, leading to a mismatch with the expected output format.

## Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to adjust the way the property and value pairs are formatted in the `command` list. We should remove the double quotes around the property and value pairs to match the expected output format.

## Corrected Version of the Function
Here is the corrected version of the `_dict_arg` function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, '{0}={1}'.format(prop, val)]
    return command
```

By making this adjustment, the function will correctly format the property and value pairs in the `command` list without unnecessary double quotes. This corrected version should now align with the expected output values and pass the failing tests.
