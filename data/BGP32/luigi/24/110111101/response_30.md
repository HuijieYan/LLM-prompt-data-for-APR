## Bug Explanation
The bug in the `_dict_arg` function arises due to the incorrect formatting of key-value pairs when constructing the `command` list. The function is currently adding double quotes around the value when building the command list, resulting in a mismatch with the expected values.

This causes the assertion errors in the test cases because the test cases expect key-value pairs without double quotes, while the function incorrectly includes double quotes in the resulting command list.

## Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to remove the double quotes around the values when constructing the command list. This adjustment will ensure that the key-value pairs are formatted correctly and match the expected output.

## Corrected Version of the Function
```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, "{0}={1}".format(prop, val)]  # Fixed formatting by removing double quotes
    return command
```

By modifying the formatting of the key-value pairs in the constructed command list, the corrected function will now generate command lists that match the expected values in the test cases.
