Based on the analysis provided, it appears that the issue lies in how the values from the dictionary are being processed and formatted into the command list. The problem is that the values are being enclosed in double quotes unnecessarily when building the command list, causing the test cases to fail due to mismatched elements.

To fix this issue, we need to update the `_dict_arg` function to properly format the key-value pairs without extra quotes. Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
class SparkSubmitTask(luigi.Task):
    """
    Template task for running a Spark job
    
    Supports running jobs on Spark local, standalone, Mesos or Yarn
    
    See http://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/submitting-applications.html
    for more information
    """

    def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
        command = []
        if value and isinstance(value, dict):
            for prop, val in value.items():
                command += [name, '{0}={1}'.format(prop, val)]
        return command
```

With this correction, the values from the dictionary will be correctly formatted without extra quotes, ensuring that the test cases pass with the expected input/output values.
