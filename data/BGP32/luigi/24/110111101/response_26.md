The bug in the `_dict_arg` function stems from the unnecessary quotation marks around the values in the command list. This causes a mismatch with the expected values in the failing test cases.

To fix this issue, we need to remove the unnecessary quotation marks around the values when constructing the command list. This can be achieved by formatting the command strings without quotation marks.

Here is a corrected version of the `_dict_arg` function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, '{0}={1}'.format(prop, val)]
    return command
```

By making this change, the function should now correctly construct the command list without unnecessary quotation marks around the values, aligning with the expected values in the failing test cases.
