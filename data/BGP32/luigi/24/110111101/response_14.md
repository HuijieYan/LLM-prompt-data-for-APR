### Solution:

#### Bug Explanation:
The bug occurs in the `_dict_arg` function where the code is incorrectly adding quotation marks around the property and value when constructing the command list. This leads to a mismatch in the expected and actual command list resulting in the failing tests.

#### Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to remove the unnecessary quotation marks around the property and value string when constructing the command list. This will align the output of the function with the expected command list in the test cases.

#### Corrected Version:
```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, '{0}={1}'.format(prop, val)]
    return command
```

By making this change, the function will correctly generate the command list without the unnecessary quotation marks, and the expected and actual command lists will match, passing the failing test cases.
