Based on the provided information, the bug in the `_dict_arg` function arises from incorrectly formatting the dictionary key-value pairs into the command list. The bug leads to additional quotation marks around the values, causing a mismatch with the expected list of arguments.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the `_dict_arg` function to correctly append key-value pairs without adding extra quotes. Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, '{0}={1}'.format(prop, val)]
    return command
```

This corrected version will correctly format the key-value pairs from the dictionary into the command list without adding unnecessary quotation marks. This will ensure that the function returns the expected list of arguments and passes the failing tests.
