### Bug Explanation
The bug in the `_dict_arg` function arises from the way the dictionary values are being handled. The function is incorrectly adding quotes around the property values while constructing the command list, leading to a mismatch between the expected and actual output. This is evident from the error messages which show differences in format with quotes.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to modify the logic in the `_dict_arg` function to construct the command list without enclosing the property values in quotes. By removing the unnecessary quotes, the function should generate the correct command list that matches the expected output.

### Corrected Version of the Function
Here is the corrected version of the `_dict_arg` function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, '{0}={1}'.format(prop, val)]
    return command
``` 

This corrected version will construct the command list without quotes around the property values, ensuring consistency with the expected output format.
