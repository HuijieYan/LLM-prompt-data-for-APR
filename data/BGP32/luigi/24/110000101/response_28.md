### Analysis:
The buggy function `_dict_arg` is intended to take a dictionary `value` and generate a list `command` containing key-value pairs formatted as strings. However, there are few issues with the current implementation:
1. The function is reusing the variable name `value` in the loop, which causes an overwrite and leads to incorrect results.
2. The formatting of the command string is not correct, resulting in extra quotes that are not needed.

### Strategy for fixing the bug:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the variable names are distinct within the loop and correct the string formatting to generate the command list correctly.

### Corrected version of the function:
```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, '{0}={1}'.format(prop, val)]
    return command
```

By using `val` instead of `value` within the loop, we can avoid overwriting the original `value` dictionary. Also, the string formatting has been corrected to remove the unnecessary quotes.

The corrected function should now satisfy the expected input/output values provided in the test cases.
