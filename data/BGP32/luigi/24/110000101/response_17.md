The bug in the provided function `_dict_arg` lies in the fact that the function uses the same variable `value` to iterate over the input dictionary and store the inner values. This overwrites the original `value` input parameter, leading to incorrect results.

To fix this bug, we should use a different variable to iterate over the dictionary items and store the inner value. Also, we need to remove the unnecessary double quotes around the `prop=value` pair in the command list.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, "{0}={1}".format(prop, val)]
    return command
```

This corrected version should now correctly generate the command list based on the input dictionary values without overwriting the original `value` variable. It also ensures that the output `command` list does not have unnecessary double quotes around the `prop=value` pairs.
