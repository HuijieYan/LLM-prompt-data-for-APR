### Analysis
The buggy function `_dict_arg` is supposed to take a dictionary as input and construct a list of command arguments based on the key-value pairs in the dictionary. However, the bug lies in how the command arguments are being constructed. The function is using the same variable `value` inside the loop which is causing the bug.

### Bug Explanation
When iterating over the key-value pairs in the input dictionary `value`, the function is using the same variable `value` for both the key and value within the loop. This results in overwriting the original `value` dictionary and incorrect command arguments being constructed.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to use different variable names for the key and value inside the loop to avoid overwriting the original dictionary. We should also change the variable name `value` that is being used for constructing the command arguments to something else to prevent confusion.

### Corrected Version
```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: luigi/contrib/spark.py

# The declaration of the class containing the corrected function
class SparkSubmitTask(luigi.Task):
    """
    Template task for running a Spark job
    
    Supports running jobs on Spark local, standalone, Mesos or Yarn
    
    See http://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/submitting-applications.html
    for more information
    """

    def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
        command = []
        if value and isinstance(value, dict):
            for prop, val in value.items():
                command += [name, '"{0}={1}"'.format(prop, val)]
        return command
``` 

By making these changes in the corrected version, the function should now correctly construct the command arguments from the input dictionary without overwriting the original `value` dictionary.
