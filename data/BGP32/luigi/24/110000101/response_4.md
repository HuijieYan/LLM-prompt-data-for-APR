### Analysis
The buggy function `_dict_arg` is designed to take a dictionary `value` and generate a command list based on the key-value pairs in the dictionary. However, there are two bugs in the function:
1. The function reuses the variable `value` in the loop, leading to incorrect output due to variable shadowing.
2. The format used to append key-value pairs to the command list is not correct, resulting in unexpected output.

### Bug Explanation
The first bug occurs because the loop variable `value` is being overwritten with the inner loop values, which causes unexpected behavior and incorrect output. The second bug happens because the format used to construct the key-value pairs is not proper for the command list.

### Fix Strategy
To fix the bugs, we need to rename the loop variable inside the loop to avoid shadowing the function argument. Additionally, we need to adjust the format used to append key-value pairs to the command list to match the expected format for command line arguments.

### Corrected Version
```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():  # Rename the inner loop variable to avoid shadowing
            command += [name, '{0}={1}'.format(prop, val)]  # Adjust the format for the command list
    return command
```
