### Analysis
The buggy function `_dict_arg` is intended to convert a dictionary `value` into a list of command arguments for a Spark job. However, the bug lies in the way the command arguments are constructed. The function incorrectly wraps the key-value pairs in double quotes, which is not the standard way to pass arguments to SparkSubmitTask. 

### Bug Explanation
1. The function mistakenly includes double quotes around the key-value pairs in the command arguments.
2. The function does not handle the case where the dictionary `value` is empty.
3. The function does not return the `value` and `prop` variables inside the loop, resulting in incorrect values being appended to the `command` list.

### Fix Strategy
To fix the bug:
1. Remove the unnecessary double quotes around the key-value pairs in the command arguments.
2. Check if the `value` dictionary is not empty before processing it.
3. Correctly append the key and value to the `command` list.

### Corrected Version
```python
class SparkSubmitTask(luigi.Task):
    def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
        command = []
        if value and isinstance(value, dict):
            for prop, val in value.items():
                command += [name, '{0}={1}'.format(prop, val)]
        return command
```

With these corrections, the function `_dict_arg` will correctly construct the command arguments for the Spark job as per the expected input/output values provided.
