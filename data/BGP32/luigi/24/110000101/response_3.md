### Analysis
The buggy function `_dict_arg` is intended to convert a dictionary of properties into a list of command line arguments. However, there is a bug in the function where the same variable name `value` is reused for the inner loop iteration, causing unexpected behavior.

### Bug Explanation
The bug occurs when the inner loop iterates over the key-value pairs in the input dictionary. Since the variable name `value` is reused for both the outer dictionary value and the inner property value, it leads to incorrect formatting of the command. This results in the final command containing incorrect key-value pairs.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we should rename the variable used in the inner loop to avoid conflicts with the outer loop. By using a different variable name for the inner loop values, we can correctly format the command list without overwriting the outer dictionary value.

### Corrected Version
```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: luigi/contrib/spark.py

# The declaration of the class containing the buggy function
class SparkSubmitTask(luigi.Task):
    """
    Template task for running a Spark job
    
    Supports running jobs on Spark local, standalone, Mesos or Yarn
    
    See http://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/submitting-applications.html
    for more information
    """

    def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
        command = []
        if value and isinstance(value, dict):
            for prop, prop_value in value.items():
                command += [name, '"{0}={1}"'.format(prop, prop_value)]
        return command
```

The corrected version of the function uses `prop_value` as the variable name in the inner loop to store the property values. This ensures that the outer dictionary values are not overwritten, and the command list is correctly formatted with key-value pairs.
