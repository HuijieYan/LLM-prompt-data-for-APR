The bug in the `_dict_arg` function is caused by reusing the variable name `value` as both the input parameter and the loop variable inside the for loop. This leads to overwriting the `value` variable with the inner loop value, causing incorrect behavior.

To fix the bug, it is necessary to use a different variable name for the loop iteration to avoid conflicts with the input parameter `value`.

Here is the corrected version of the `_dict_arg` function:
```python
    def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
        command = []
        if value and isinstance(value, dict):
            for prop, prop_value in value.items():
                command += [name, '"{0}={1}"'.format(prop, prop_value)]
        return command
```

This corrected function uses `prop_value` as the loop iteration variable to prevent overwriting the `value` variable.
