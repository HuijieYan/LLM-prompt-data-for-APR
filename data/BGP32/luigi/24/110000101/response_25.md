### Analysis:
The buggy function `_dict_arg` is designed to take a dictionary as input and convert it into a list of command line arguments. Each key-value pair in the dictionary should be converted into a string in the format `"{key}={value}"` and added to the command list.

### Identifying the error:
The error in the buggy function is that the inner loop variable `value` is being overwritten within the loop, causing unexpected behavior. This leads to the incorrect formation of the command list.

### Explanation of the bug:
1. In the buggy function, the inner loop variable `value` is overwritten in the line `for prop, value in value.items():`.
2. As a result, the original value dictionary is being overwritten with the individual key-value pairs, causing the loop to terminate prematurely.
3. This leads to only the last key-value pair being added to the command list.
4. Additionally, the formatting of the command is incorrect due to the double quotes around the key-value pair.

### Fixing the bug:
To fix the bug, we need to rename the inner loop variable to avoid overwriting the input dictionary. To correctly format the key-value pairs in the command list, we should remove the double quotes around the formatted string.

### Corrected version of the function:
```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, '{0}={1}'.format(prop, val)]
    return command
```

The corrected version of the function renames the inner loop variable to `val` to avoid overwriting the input dictionary. Additionally, it formats the key-value pairs without the unnecessary double quotes.

By implementing these corrections, the function should now correctly create the command list from the input dictionary as expected in the test cases provided.
