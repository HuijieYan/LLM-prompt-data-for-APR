### Analysis
The buggy function `_dict_arg()` is intended to create a list of command arguments based on a dictionary input. The function currently has a bug in how it constructs the command list, resulting in incorrect formatting of the arguments.

### Error Location
The error is located in the line:
```python
command += [name, '"{0}={1}"'.format(prop, value)]
```
The issue lies in the formatting of the command argument where unnecessary double quotes are added around the key-value pair.

### Cause of the Bug
The bug causes the command list to contain improperly formatted key-value pairs with unnecessary double quotes. This makes the command arguments invalid when used for a Spark job submission.

### Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, the unnecessary double quotes need to be removed from the key-value pairs when constructing the command list.

### Corrected Version
```python
# The corrected version of the buggy function
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, "{0}={1}".format(prop, val)]
    return command
```

Now, the corrected version of the `_dict_arg()` function should properly format the command list without unnecessary double quotes around the key-value pairs. This should satisfy the expected input/output values for the provided test cases.
