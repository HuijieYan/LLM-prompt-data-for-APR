### Analysis
The buggy function `_dict_arg` is intended to convert a dictionary into a list of command arguments, where each key-value pair in the dictionary becomes a single argument in the format `"{key}={value}"`. However, the bug lies in the fact that the function reuses the variable `value` in the loop, which overwrites the input `value`.

### Bug Explanation
When the function loops through the key-value pairs in the input dictionary, it references the loop variable as `value`. This causes the loop to overwrite the original `value` parameter, resulting in the incorrect output where `value` is the value instead of the key of the key-value pair.

### Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to use different variable names for the loop variable and the key-value pair items to avoid overwriting the input parameter. By correcting the loop variable name, we can ensure that each argument in the command is built correctly.

### Corrected Version of the Function
```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():  # Change variable name from 'value' to 'val'
            command += [name, '"{0}={1}"'.format(prop, val)]  # Use 'val' instead of 'value'
    return command
```
