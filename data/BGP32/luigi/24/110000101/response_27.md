### Explanation:
The bug in the provided function `_dict_arg` is caused by the fact that the function is using the same variable `value` in the loop to iterate over the dictionary values and also as the final value to be inserted into the `command` list. This leads to incorrect behavior where the function adds the final value multiple times to the `command` list instead of adding each key-value pair as intended.

### Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to rename the variables inside the loop to avoid conflicts with the outer variable. Additionally, we should directly append the key-value pair to the `command` list instead of the complex string formatting used in the buggy code.

### Corrected Version:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for key, val in value.items():  # Renamed variables 'prop' and 'value' to 'key' and 'val'
            command += [name, key + '=' + val]  # Appending key-value pairs directly to 'command'
    return command
```
