### Explanation of the bug
The bug in the `_dict_arg` function lies in the fact that it reuses the variable `value` for iteration over the dictionary, which leads to the loss of the original `value` parameter. This results in incorrect behavior and incorrect output of the command list.

### Strategy for fixing the bug
To fix the bug, avoid reusing the variable `value` for the inner loop iteration. Instead, use a different variable name to iterate over the dictionary items and construct the `command` list correctly.

### Corrected version of the function

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():  # Using a different variable name 'val' for iteration
            command += [name, '"{0}={1}"'.format(prop, val)]
    return command
``` 

By making this change, the function will correctly construct the `command` list based on the input dictionary values, ensuring that the original `value` parameter remains unchanged.
