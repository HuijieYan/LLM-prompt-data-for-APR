## Analysis
The buggy function `_dict_arg` is designed to take a dictionary of properties and values, and convert it into a list of command arguments. However, there is a bug in the function where the property-value pairs are not formatted correctly.

## Bug Explanation
The bug in the function lies in the line `command += [name, '"{0}={1}"'.format(prop, value)]`. The issue is that the property-value pair is being enclosed in double quotes, which is not necessary and causes incorrect formatting of the command arguments.

## Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to remove the unnecessary double quotes around the property-value pair in the command argument.

## Corrected Version
```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, '{0}={1}'.format(prop, val)]
    return command
```

This corrected version should now properly format the property-value pairs without unnecessary double quotes, satisfying the expected input/output values for the provided cases.
