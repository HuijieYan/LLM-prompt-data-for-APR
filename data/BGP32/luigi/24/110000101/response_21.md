### Analysis
The buggy function `_dict_arg` is intended to take a dictionary as input, iterate over its key-value pairs, and construct a command list to be used in Spark job submission. The bug seems to be the incorrect manipulation of the command list inside the loop.

### Error Location
The error lies in the line inside the loop where the command list is being appended. The current implementation is adding unnecessary quotes around the key-value pairs.

### Cause of Bug
The bug is caused by the incorrect formatting of the key-value pairs in the command list. The quotes around the key-value pairs are unnecessary and lead to an incorrect command being constructed.

### Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to remove the unnecessary quotes around the key-value pairs while constructing the command list inside the loop.

### Corrected Version of the Function
```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, '{0}={1}'.format(prop, val)]
    return command
```

With this corrected version, the function will construct the command list correctly without unnecessary quotes around the key-value pairs.
