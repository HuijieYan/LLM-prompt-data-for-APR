### Analysis
1. The function `_dict_arg` is supposed to take a dictionary input and convert it into a list of command arguments.
2. The function iterates over the key-value pairs in the input dictionary and constructs command arguments accordingly.
3. The bug in the function lies in the way it constructs the command string for each key-value pair.
4. The current implementation adds double quotes around the key-value pair, which is not necessary and causes the output to be incorrect.

### Bug Cause
The bug is caused by adding unnecessary double quotes around the key-value pair in the command list, leading to an incorrect format for the command arguments.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug
To fix the bug, simply remove the double quotes from around the key-value pair formatting inside the loop that constructs the command list.

### Corrected Version of the Function
```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, '{0}={1}'.format(prop, val)]
    return command
```

By removing the double quotes from `'{0}={1}'` formatting, we ensure that the key-value pairs are added to the command list correctly without unnecessary formatting.
