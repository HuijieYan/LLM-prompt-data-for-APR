Strategy for fixing the bug:
1. The bug seems to be caused by reusing the variable name "value" in the loop iteration, leading to overwriting the original "value" parameter. This can be resolved by using a different variable name for the loop iteration.
2. Additionally, the quotes should not be included around the key-value pair when constructing the command list.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for key, val in value.items():
            command += [name, '{0}={1}'.format(key, val)]
    return command
``` 

This corrected version should now correctly handle the input dictionary and construct the command list as expected in the provided test cases.
