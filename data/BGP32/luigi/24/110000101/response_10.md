## Analysis
The buggy function `_dict_arg` is intended to take a dictionary as input, iterate over key-value pairs, and construct a list with the specified name and formatted key-value pairs. However, there are a few potential issues in the function:
1. The same variable name `value` is used for both the input parameter and the loop variable, causing confusion and potential bugs.
2. The formatted string for each key-value pair is enclosed in double quotes, which may not be necessary and could result in incorrect formatting.

## Bug Explanation
The bug in the function is due to reusing the variable `value` for both the input parameter and the loop variable. This causes the original `value` to be overwritten, leading to incorrect behavior. Additionally, unnecessary double quotes are added to the formatted key-value pairs, which deviates from the expected output format.

## Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug:
1. Avoid reusing the variable name `value` in the loop and use a different variable name.
2. Remove the unnecessary double quotes from the formatted key-value pairs.

## Corrected Version
```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: luigi/contrib/spark.py

# The corrected version of the class containing the buggy function
class SparkSubmitTask(luigi.Task):
    """
    Template task for running a Spark job
    
    Supports running jobs on Spark local, standalone, Mesos or Yarn
    
    See http://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/submitting-applications.html
    for more information
    """

    
    # The corrected version of the buggy function
    def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
        command = []
        if value and isinstance(value, dict):
            for prop, val in value.items():
                command += [name, '{0}={1}'.format(prop, val)]
        return command
```

This corrected version of the `_dict_arg` function ensures that the input parameter `value` is not overwritten, and formats the key-value pairs without unnecessary double quotes. The function will now correctly construct the list of key-value pairs with the specified name.
