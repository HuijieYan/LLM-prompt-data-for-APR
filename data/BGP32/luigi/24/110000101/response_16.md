### Analysis
The buggy function `_dict_arg` is supposed to create a list `command` with key-value pairs from a dictionary `value` in a specific format. However, the bug lies in the way the key-value pairs are being formatted and added to the `command` list. The function currently wraps each key-value pair in double quotes, which is unnecessary and causes issues when the command is executed.

### Bug Explanation
The bug stems from the incorrect formatting of key-value pairs in the `command` list. The incorrect format causes issues when the command is passed to be executed, leading to unexpected behavior or errors.

### Fixing the Bug
To fix the bug, we need to update the way key-value pairs are added to the `command` list. We should simply concatenate the key and value separated by an equals sign ('='), without wrapping them in double quotes.

### Corrected Version
```python
class SparkSubmitTask(luigi.Task):
    """
    Template task for running a Spark job
    
    Supports running jobs on Spark local, standalone, Mesos or Yarn
    
    See http://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/submitting-applications.html
    for more information
    """

    def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
        command = []
        if value and isinstance(value, dict):
            for prop, val in value.items():
                command += [name, '{}={}'.format(prop, val)]
        return command
```

The corrected version of the `_dict_arg` function now correctly formats the key-value pairs in the `command` list without unnecessary double quotes. This fix ensures that the function behaves as expected and the command is properly formatted for execution.
