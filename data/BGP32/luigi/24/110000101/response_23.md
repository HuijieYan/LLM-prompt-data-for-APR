### Explanation
The bug in the `_dict_arg` function is due to reusing the variable name `value` for the loop iteration within the function. This causes the original `value` dict to be overwritten and results in incorrect output. Additionally, unnecessary double quotes are added around the key-value pairs in the command list.

### Strategy for fixing the bug
To fix the bug, we need to use a different variable name for the loop iteration. We also need to remove the unnecessary double quotes around the key-value pairs added to the command list.

### Corrected version of the function

```python
# The declaration of the class containing the corrected function
class SparkSubmitTask(luigi.Task):
    """
    Template task for running a Spark job
    
    Supports running jobs on Spark local, standalone, Mesos or Yarn
    
    See http://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/submitting-applications.html
    for more information
    """

    def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
        command = []
        if value and isinstance(value, dict):
            for key, val in value.items():
                command += [name, "{0}={1}".format(key, val)]
        return command
```

After applying the corrections, the function should now correctly build the `command` list with key-value pairs in the format `'key=value'`.
