## Error in the buggy function

The bug in the `_dict_arg` function lies in the use of the same variable name `value` in the for loop for iterating over the dictionary items, which overwrites the original value passed as a parameter. This causes the function to only process the last key-value pair in the dictionary and return it as a single element list, instead of constructing a list of key-value pairs.

## Fixing the bug

To fix the bug, we need to use a different variable name for the loop iteration and construct the command list correctly by appending each key-value pair separately.

## Corrected version of the function

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():  # Use a different variable name here
            command += [name, '{0}={1}'.format(prop, val)]  # Append each key-value pair separately
    return command
``` 

After implementing this corrected version, the function should now work as expected and satisfy all the provided test cases.
