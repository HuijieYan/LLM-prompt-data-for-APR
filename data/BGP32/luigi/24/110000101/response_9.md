### Analysis
The buggy function `_dict_arg` is intended to construct a command list for submitting Spark jobs based on a dictionary of key-value pairs. However, the bug lies in the fact that the inner loop variable `value` is being overwritten with a new value instead of being assigned to a temporary variable. This leads to unexpected behavior and incorrect command construction.

### Bug Cause
The bug is caused by reusing the variable `value` within the loop to iterate over the dictionary items. This results in the value of the outer `value` parameter being overwritten. As a result, the constructed `command` list does not reflect the correct key-value pairs.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, a temporary variable should be used in the inner loop to avoid overwriting the outer `value` parameter. This will ensure that the constructed `command` list contains the correct key-value pairs.

### Corrected Version
```python
class SparkSubmitTask(luigi.Task):
    def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
        command = []
        if value and isinstance(value, dict):
            for prop, val in value.items():  # Use a different variable name (e.g., val) inside the loop
                command += [name, '"{0}={1}"'.format(prop, val)] 
        return command
```

By using a separate variable `val` inside the loop, we can ensure that the original `value` parameter is not overwritten, and the constructed `command` list reflects the correct key-value pairs.
