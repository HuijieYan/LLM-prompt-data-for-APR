### Analysis
The buggy function `_dict_arg` is supposed to take a name and a dictionary as input, iterate over the key-value pairs in the dictionary, and construct a list of command strings based on the format `"name='key=value'"`. However, there is a bug in the code where the inner loop variable name `value` is overshadowing the input parameter `value`.

### Bug Explanation
The bug occurs because the inner loop variable `value` has the same name as the input parameter `value`. This results in the incorrect value being assigned to `command` list, as the loop variable `value` is replaced with the inner loop value. This leads to incorrect command strings being constructed.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to rename the inner loop variable `value` to something else to avoid shadowing the input parameter `value`. This will ensure that the correct values are used to construct the command strings.
