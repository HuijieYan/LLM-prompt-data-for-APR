### Bug Explanation
The bug in the `_dict_arg` function is caused by reusing the variable name `value` in the for loop, which overrides the outer variable `value`. This causes an issue when trying to access the inner `value` variable since it changes the value from the outer dictionary. 

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix this bug, we need to use a different variable name for the inner loop value in the for loop. By doing this, we can ensure that we maintain access to the original outer value. 

### Corrected Version of the Function

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, prop_value in value.items():  # Use a different variable name here to avoid overriding outer value
            command += [name, '"{0}={1}"'.format(prop, prop_value)]
    return command
```
