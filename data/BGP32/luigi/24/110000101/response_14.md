The bug in the provided function `_dict_arg` is that it reuses the variable name `value` for both the input parameter and the loop iterator, causing the loop to overwrite the original `value` dictionary. This results in only the last key-value pair being added to the `command` list.

To fix this bug, we should use a different variable name for the loop iterator to prevent overwriting the original `value` dictionary. 

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, '"{0}={1}"'.format(prop, val)]
    return command
```

This corrected version uses `val` as the loop iterator to avoid conflicts with the input parameter `value`.
