## Analysis
The buggy function `_dict_arg` is intended to convert a dictionary into a list of strings following a specific format. It seems like the function is not handling the formatting correctly, as it is adding unnecessary quotes around the key-value pairs.

## Potential Error Locations
1. The format string `"{0}={1}"` might be causing the issue with unnecessary quotes.
2. The addition of `name` before the key-value pair may not be necessary.

## Cause of the Bug
The bug is caused by the unnecessary quotes added around the key-value pairs in the output list.

## Strategy for Fixing the Bug
1. Remove the quotes around the key-value pairs in the format string.
2. Remove the addition of `name` before the key-value pair in the command list.

## Corrected Version
```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, '{0}={1}'.format(prop, val)]
    return command
``` 

By making these changes, the function should now correctly convert a dictionary into the desired list format without unnecessary quotes and with the correct key-value pairs.
