The bug in the `_dict_arg` function is that the inner loop variable `value` is being overwritten by the loop iterator `value`. This is because the loop iterator variable `value` is used for both the loop and the nested function, causing the value to be changed in the outer loop.

To fix this bug, we can change the variable name inside the inner loop to something different from the loop iterator. 

Here is the corrected version of the `_dict_arg` function:

```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: luigi/contrib/spark.py

# The declaration of the class containing the buggy function
class SparkSubmitTask(luigi.Task):
    """
    Template task for running a Spark job
    
    Supports running jobs on Spark local, standalone, Mesos or Yarn
    
    See http://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/submitting-applications.html
    for more information
    """

    # corrected version of the buggy function
    def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
        command = []
        if value and isinstance(value, dict):
            for prop, prop_value in value.items():  # changed the variable name here
                command += [name, '"{0}={1}"'.format(prop, prop_value)]
        return command
```

Now, the `prop_value` variable is used in the inner loop to access the value in the dictionary, avoiding the issue of overwriting the loop iterator variable. This corrected version should now output the expected values for the provided test cases.
