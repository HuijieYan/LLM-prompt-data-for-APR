Potential error locations within the buggy function:
1. The variable `value` may not always be a dictionary, but the function does not handle this case.
2. The function is using the same variable name `value` for both the input dictionary and the inner loop iteration, which can cause confusion and errors.

Cause of the bug:
The bug is caused by the function not accounting for scenarios where the input `value` is not a dictionary. Additionally, reusing the variable name `value` inside the loop leads to incorrect behavior.

Strategy for fixing the bug:
1. Check if the input `value` is a dictionary before proceeding with the loop.
2. Use a different variable name inside the loop to avoid confusion and potential errors.
3. Format the output correctly without unnecessary quotes around the key-value pairs.

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if isinstance(value, dict):
        for key, val in value.items():
            command.extend([name, "{0}={1}".format(key, val)])  # Correctly format the key-value pairs
    return command
```

The above corrected version of the function should now properly handle cases where `value` is a dictionary or not, and format the output as expected.
