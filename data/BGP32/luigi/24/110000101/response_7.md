### Explanation of the bug

The bug in the `_dict_arg` function lies in the fact that the loop variable `value` is being overwritten when iterating over the input dictionary. This results in incorrect values being appended to the `command` list.

### Strategy for fixing the bug

To fix the bug, we need to use a different variable name for the loop variable in order to prevent overwriting the input variable `value`. We can use a variable like `key` for iterating over the dictionary items.

### Corrected version of the function

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for key, val in value.items():
            command += [name, '"{0}={1}"'.format(key, val)]
    return command
``` 

This corrected version of the function should now properly iterate over the dictionary items and append the correct key-value pairs to the `command` list.
