### Analysis
The function `_dict_arg` is supposed to take a dictionary `value`, iterate over its key-value pairs, and construct a list `command` with elements based on the key-value pairs. Each element should be in the format `name='prop=value'`.

### Potential Error Locations
1. The for loop that iterates over the dictionary may have an issue with overwriting the `value` variable.
2. The format string used to construct the command element might have incorrect syntax.

### Bug Explanation
The bug arises from the loop variable `value` conflicting with the input parameter `value`. This leads to incorrect construction of the command list. Furthermore, the string formatting of the command element may not be correctly handling the key-value pairs.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug
To fix the bug, rename the loop variable in the `for` loop to avoid conflicts with the input parameter. Additionally, adjust the format string to correctly include the key and value in the command element.

### Corrected Version
```python
    def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
        command = []
        if value and isinstance(value, dict):
            for prop, val in value.items():
                command += [name, '{0}={1}'.format(prop, val)]
        return command
```
