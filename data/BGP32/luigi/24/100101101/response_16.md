### Analysis:
The buggy function `_dict_arg` is intended to take a dictionary as input, iterate over its items, and construct a command list based on the key-value pairs in the dictionary. The bug in the function lies in how it constructs the command list by incorrectly formatting the key-value pairs.

### Bug:
The bug in the `_dict_arg` function is in the line:
```python
command += [name, '"{0}={1}"'.format(prop, value)]
```
Here, the value is wrapped in double quotes unnecessarily, causing the command list to have incorrect formatting.

### Fix:
To fix the bug, we should remove the unnecessary double quotes around the value in the command list construction.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, '{0}={1}'.format(prop, val)]
    return command
```

By correcting the function as shown above, the function should now properly construct the command list in the desired format, and it should pass the failing tests with the expected values.
