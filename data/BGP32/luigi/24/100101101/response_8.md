### Bug Explanation:
The bug in the `_dict_arg` function lies in the way the command list is constructed. The bug is related to the incorrect formatting of the value pairs when iterating over the dictionary items and adding them to the `command` list.

In the provided buggy code, each key-value pair from the dictionary is added as a single string with extra double quotes, which causes issues when compared with the expected values in the test cases. The expected output includes the key-value pairs separated by an equal sign without additional double quotes.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that when constructing the command list, we format the key-value pairs in the correct way to match the expected output in the tests. This involves removing the extra double quotes around the key-value pairs.

### Corrected Version of the `_dict_arg` Function:
```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, '{0}={1}'.format(prop, val)]
    return command
```

By using the above corrected version with the removed extra double quotes, the `_dict_arg` function should now correctly format the key-value pairs and construct the `command` list as expected in the failing test cases.
