The bug in the `_dict_arg` function lies in the way the key-value pairs from the dictionary are being formatted into the command list. The current implementation wraps the key-value pairs in double quotes unnecessarily, causing the tests to fail.

To fix this bug, we need to remove the unnecessary double quotes around the key-value pairs in the command list. 

Here is the corrected version of the `_dict_arg` function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, '{0}={1}'.format(prop, val)]
    return command
```

By adjusting the formatting of the key-value pairs in the `command` list, the function now correctly constructs the command list without unnecessary double quotes. This correction should make the failing tests pass.
