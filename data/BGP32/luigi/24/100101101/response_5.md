### Bug Explanation:
The bug in the `_dict_arg` function is caused by the incorrect formatting of the key-value pairs in the command list. The current implementation is adding unnecessary quotes around the key-value pairs when constructing the command list, which leads to the failing tests. The values should be added directly without quotes to match the expected format.

### Bug Fix:
To fix the bug, we need to remove the unnecessary quotes when constructing the command list. This can be achieved by directly adding the key-value pairs without formatting them as string literals.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, value in value.items():
            command += [name, "{0}={1}".format(prop, value)]
    return command
```

By making this change, the corrected function should now properly construct the command list without unnecessary quotes, matching the expected values in the failing tests.
