The bug in the `_dict_arg` function lies in the way the values are being formatted when constructing the `command` list. The values are being enclosed in double quotes unnecessarily which causes the test cases to fail.

The correct format should only be `'--conf', 'Prop=Value'` instead of `'--conf', '"Prop=Value"'` to match the expected values.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the line where the command is being constructed to remove the unnecessary double quotes.

Here is the corrected version of the `_dict_arg` function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():  # Changing variable name from value to val to avoid conflicts
            command += [name, '{0}={1}'.format(prop, val)]  # Removed unnecessary double quotes
    return command
```

With this correction, the function will now construct the command list correctly without enclosing the values in double quotes. This should make the function pass the failing test cases provided.
