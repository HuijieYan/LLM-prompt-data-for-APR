The bug in the `_dict_arg` function is caused by the way the command list is constructed. In the current implementation, the values are added in a format that wraps the key-value pairs with double quotes, which is incorrect based on the expected output.

The correct format should directly concatenate the key and value without wrapping them in double quotes. This is the reason why the test cases are failing to match the expected output.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the way the key-value pairs are added to the `command` list. Instead of adding `"key=value"`, we should add `key=value`.

Here is the corrected version of the `_dict_arg` function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, '{0}={1}'.format(prop, val)]
    return command
```

This corrected version should now pass the failing test cases and return the expected output.

By making this simple adjustment, the function will correctly format the key-value pairs within the command list, matching the expected values in the failing tests.
