### Bug Explanation
The bug in the `_dict_arg` function stems from the incorrect handling of dictionary values during the creation of the `command` list. The function is currently wrapping the dictionary values with double quotes, which is not desirable. The expected behavior is to have the key and value pairs separated by an equal sign without quotes.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to modify the way the key-value pairs from the dictionary are added to the `command` list. Instead of wrapping them in quotes, we should concatenate the key and value with an equal sign.

### Corrected Version of the Function
```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, '{0}={1}'.format(prop, val)]
    return command
```

By making this change, the function will now correctly generate the `command` list with the key-value pairs from the dictionary without wrapping them in quotes. This corrected version should pass the failing tests and satisfy the expected input/output values.
