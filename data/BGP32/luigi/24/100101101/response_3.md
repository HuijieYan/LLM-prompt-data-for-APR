### Bug Analysis:
The issue in the `_dict_arg` function stems from the way the command list is being built. In the current implementation, the values are enclosed in double quotes (`"`) which is causing the test cases to fail as the expected output does not have the values enclosed in double quotes. Additionally, the format used to join the property and value is incorrect since it should be `prop=value` without quotes for each pair.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Remove the double quotes around the property and value when constructing the command list.
2. Correct the format for joining the property and value to be `prop=value` without quotes.

### Corrected Version of the Buggy Function:
```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, "{0}={1}".format(prop, val)]
    return command
```

By making the above changes, the function now correctly constructs the command list without enclosing values in double quotes and following the correct format of `prop=value`.
