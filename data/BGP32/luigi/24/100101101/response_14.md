## Analysis
The buggy function `_dict_arg` is intended to process a dictionary input and convert it into a list of command arguments. However, the bug lies in how the function constructs each argument string within the list `command`. In the provided implementation, the bug is shown by including double quotes surrounding the key-value pairs, which is not the expected behavior.

The test functions provided attempt to assert the command arguments constructed by `_dict_arg` against the expected arguments. Since the constructed arguments do not match the expected format, the tests fail.

## Bug
The bug in the `_dict_arg` function is caused by adding double quotes around the key-value pairs in the command list. This formatting does not match the expected command structure, leading to failing tests.

## Fix
To fix the bug, the function should construct the command list without including the unnecessary double quotes around the key-value pairs. Each key-value pair should be formatted directly as `prop=value` without additional quotes.

## Corrected Version

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, value in value.items():
            command += [name, '{0}={1}'.format(prop, value)]
    return command
```

With this correction, the `_dict_arg` function will construct the command list as expected, leading to the passing of the provided tests.
