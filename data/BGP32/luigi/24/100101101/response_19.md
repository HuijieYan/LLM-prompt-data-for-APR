The bug in the `_dict_arg` function lies in the way it is handling the dictionary values and constructing the command list. The usage of double quotes around the key-value pairs in the command list is causing the values to be incorrectly formatted.

To fix this bug, we should modify the function to construct the command list without enclosing the key-value pairs in double quotes.

Here is the corrected version of the `_dict_arg` function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, '{0}={1}'.format(prop, val)]
    return command
```

This corrected version should now correctly construct the command list without the unnecessary double quotes, ensuring that the test cases pass as expected.
