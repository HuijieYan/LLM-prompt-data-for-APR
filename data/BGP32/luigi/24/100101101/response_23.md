The bug in the `_dict_arg` function is caused by the unnecessary quoting of the property-value pairs. The function incorrectly adds double quotes around the property-value pairs when constructing the command list. This results in the test cases failing as they expect the property-value pairs to be unquoted.

To fix the bug, we need to remove the unnecessary double quotes when constructing the command list. Below is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, "{0}={1}".format(prop, val)]
    return command
```

By removing the double quotes around `{0}={1}`, the corrected function now constructs the command list correctly without quoting the property-value pairs. This change aligns the function with the expected input/output values provided in the failing tests.

This corrected version of the function should now pass the failing tests and produce the expected output.
