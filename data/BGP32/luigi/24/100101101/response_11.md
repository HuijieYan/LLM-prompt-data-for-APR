The bug in the `_dict_arg` function arises from incorrectly formatting the key-value pairs when adding them to the `command` list. The function is adding quotes around the key-value pairs, which is not necessary and causes the test cases to fail.

To fix the bug, we need to remove the unnecessary quotes from the key-value pairs before adding them to the `command` list.

Here is the corrected version of the `_dict_arg` function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, '{0}={1}'.format(prop, val)]
    return command
```

By making this change, the function will now correctly format the key-value pairs without unnecessary quotes, and the test cases should pass as expected.
