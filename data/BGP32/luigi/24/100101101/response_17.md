## Bug Explanation
The bug in the `_dict_arg` function lies in the way it constructs the command list. The issue arises from the fact that the function is adding extra quotes around the property-value pairs when constructing the command list. This extra quoting leads to a mismatch between the expected command list structure and the actual command list structure in the failing test cases.

## Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to modify how the property-value pairs are added to the command list. Instead of adding extra quotes around the property-value pairs, we should construct the command list without these additional quotes. This will ensure that the resulting command list matches the expected command list structure.

## Corrected Version of the Function

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():  # Change the variable name from value to val
            command += [name, '{0}={1}'.format(prop, val)]  # Remove the extra quotes around the property-value pair
    return command
```

By making this change, the `_dict_arg` function will now correctly construct the command list without unnecessary quoting, ensuring that it matches the expected command list structure in the failing test cases. This corrected version should address the bug and allow the tests to pass successfully.
