The issue in the current implementation lies in how the key-value pairs from the input dictionary are being formatted into strings within the `command` list. The buggy function is adding unnecessary double quotes around the key-value pairs, causing the failing tests.

To fix this issue, we should remove the double quotes in the string formatting to correctly generate the command list items.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, "{0}={1}".format(prop, val)]
    return command
```

This corrected version should now correctly format the key-value pairs without unnecessary double quotes and pass the failing tests provided.
