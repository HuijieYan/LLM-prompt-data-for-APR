The bug in the `_dict_arg` function stems from the incorrect formatting of the command list. The function is mistakenly adding double quotes around the key-value pairs, resulting in an incorrect command formation.

To fix this bug, we need to remove the unnecessary double quotes around the key-value pairs in the command list.

Here is the corrected version of the `_dict_arg` function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, '{0}={1}'.format(prop, val)]
    return command
```

This updated version will correctly format the key-value pairs without unnecessary double quotes, aligning with the expected output values for the failing tests.
