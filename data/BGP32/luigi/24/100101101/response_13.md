### Cause of the Bug
The bug in the `_dict_arg` function is caused by the incorrect formatting of the command list when building it from the input dictionary. The current implementation adds unnecessary quotes around the values, which is not expected based on the test cases provided.

In both test cases, the expected output does not include quotes around the property values when constructing the command list. However, the current implementation adds quotes around the property values, leading to a mismatch between the actual and expected command lists.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug
To fix the bug, we need to remove the unnecessary quotes around the property values when constructing the command list. Instead of formatting the values as `"{0}={1}"`, we should construct them directly as `{0}={1}` to match the expected output in the failing tests.

### Corrected Version of the Function
```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, '{0}={1}'.format(prop, val)]
    return command
```

By removing the quotes from around the `"{0}={1}"` format string in the list comprehension, the corrected version of the `_dict_arg` function should now construct the command list in a way that matches the expected output in the failing tests.
