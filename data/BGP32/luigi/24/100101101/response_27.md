### Bug Explanation
The bug in the `_dict_arg` function occurs because the original implementation was incorrectly handling dictionary values when constructing the `command` list. It was adding unnecessary quotes around the key-value pairs generated from the dictionary.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to remove the unnecessary quotes around the key-value pairs when constructing the command list. This can be done by modifying the line where the key-value pairs are appended to the list.

### Corrected Version of the Function
```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, '{0}={1}'.format(prop, val)]
    return command
```

By making this change, the corrected `_dict_arg` function now correctly constructs the command list without adding unnecessary quotes around the key-value pairs from the dictionary. This corrected version should pass the failing tests provided.
