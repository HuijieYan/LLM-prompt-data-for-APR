## Analysis
The buggy function `_dict_arg` is intended to convert a dictionary into a list of command arguments. The issue lies in how the values are being formatted and concatenated to the `command` list. The current implementation wraps each key-value pair in double quotes, which is causing the failing tests.

In both cases provided, the expected output does not include the key-value pairs being surrounded by double quotes, unlike the actual output.

## Bug
The bug arises from the formatting of key-value pairs within the command list. The buggy function adds unnecessary double quotes around each key-value pair, leading to a mismatch with the expected output.

## Fix
To fix the bug, we need to remove the unnecessary double quotes around the key-value pairs when appending them to the `command` list. We can achieve this by removing the double quotes from the format string.

## Corrected Version
```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, "{0}={1}".format(prop, val)]
    return command
```

With this correction, the function should now correctly generate the command list without unnecessary double quotes, satisfying the expected output and passing the failing tests.
