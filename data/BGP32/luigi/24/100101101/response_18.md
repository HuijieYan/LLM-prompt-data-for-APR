### Bug Explanation
The bug in the `_dict_arg` function is due to the usage of double quotes around the key-value pairs in the command list. This results in the incorrect behavior when generating the command list for the subprocess. The expected format should not include double quotes around the key-value pairs.

### Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to remove the double quotes around the key-value pairs in the command list generated by the `_dict_arg` function.

### Corrected Version
```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, '{0}={1}'.format(prop, val)]
    return command
```

By making this change, the corrected function should now generate the command list in the expected format without double quotes around the key-value pairs. This fix will align the function with the expected output values provided in the failing tests.
