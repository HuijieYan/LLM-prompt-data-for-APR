The bug in the `_dict_arg` function arises from incorrectly formatting the key-value pairs of the dictionary `value` into the `command` list. The current implementation wraps the key-value pairs with double quotes, which is not necessary and causes the test cases to fail.

To fix the bug, we need to remove the unnecessary double quotes and change the formatting of the key-value pairs in the `command` list.

Here is the corrected version of the `_dict_arg` function:

```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: luigi/contrib/spark.py

def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, '{0}={1}'.format(prop, val)]
    return command
```

This corrected version will properly format the key-value pairs from the dictionary `value` into the `command` list without unnecessary double quotes. It should now produce the expected output for the failing test cases provided.
