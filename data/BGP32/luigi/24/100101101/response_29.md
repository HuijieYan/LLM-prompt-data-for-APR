The bug in the `_dict_arg` function is related to how the command list is being constructed. The issue lies in the line `command += [name, '"{0}={1}"'.format(prop, value)]`. The problem is that each key-value pair should be added individually to the list, but the current implementation is adding them as a single string.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the line to separate the key and value into two separate elements in the `command` list. Here is the corrected version of the `_dict_arg` function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, '{0}={1}'.format(prop, val)]
    return command
```

By updating the function as shown above, each key-value pair will be added as separate elements in the `command` list, which aligns with the expected output values. This correction should resolve the failing tests provided.
