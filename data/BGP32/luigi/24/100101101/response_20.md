### Bug Explanation
The issue in the `_dict_arg` function is caused by the incorrect handling of key-value pairs in the dictionary. The function is incorrectly quoting the key-value pairs with double quotes, resulting in a mismatch with the expected output values in the failing tests.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix this bug, the function should construct the command list by directly appending the key-value pairs without extra quotes. This will align the output with the expected values in the failing tests.

### Corrected Version of the Function
```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: luigi/contrib/spark.py

def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, '{0}={1}'.format(prop, val)]
    return command
```

By correcting the `_dict_arg` function as shown above, it should now correctly construct the command list without unnecessary quoting, matching the expected output values in the failing tests.
