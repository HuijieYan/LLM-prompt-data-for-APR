The issue in the `_dict_arg` function arises from the incorrect formatting of key-value pairs when creating the command list. In the current implementation, the values are enclosed in double quotes, which is not necessary for command line arguments.

To fix this bug, we need to remove the unnecessary double quotes around the values in the generated command list inside the `for` loop.

Here is the corrected version of the `_dict_arg` function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, '{0}={1}'.format(prop, val)]
    return command
```

By making this change, the function will now properly format the key-value pairs without unnecessary double quotes, which should align with the expected input/output values specified in the failing test cases.
