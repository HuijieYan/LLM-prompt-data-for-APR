The bug in the `_dict_arg` function lies in the way it constructs the command list when iterating over the dictionary items. The bug is related to not correctly formatting the key-value pairs of the dictionary before adding them to the command list.

To fix this bug, we need to modify how the key-value pairs are formatted in the command list.

Here is the corrected version of the `_dict_arg` function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, '{0}={1}'.format(prop, val)]
    return command
```

By using `{0}={1}.format(prop, val)`, we correctly format the key-value pairs in the command list.

This corrected version should now pass the failing tests provided in the question.
