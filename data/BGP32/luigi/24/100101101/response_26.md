The bug in the `_dict_arg` function lies in how the dictionary values are being formatted into the `command` list. The current implementation is adding extra quotes around the key-value pairs which is causing the test cases to fail.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the way the key-value pairs are added to the `command` list by removing the extra quotes.

Here is the corrected version of the `_dict_arg` function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, '{0}={1}'.format(prop, val)]
    return command
```

This corrected version will format the key-value pairs in the `command` list without extra quotes, aligning with the expected output values in the failing test cases. The function should now pass the failing test cases successfully.
