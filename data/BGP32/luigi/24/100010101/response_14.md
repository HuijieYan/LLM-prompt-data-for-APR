### Analysis
1. The `_dict_arg` function takes a `name` and a `value` as input parameters, where `value` is expected to be a dictionary.
2. It iterates over the items in the dictionary and constructs a list `command` based on the key-value pairs.
3. The bug seems to be related to how the function handles formatting the key-value pairs from the dictionary.
4. The error messages indicate that the formatting of key-value pairs is not consistent with the expected format.

### Bug
The bug in the function `_dict_arg` is that it encloses the property value within double quotes, resulting in a mismatch between the expected and actual values.

### Fix
To fix the bug, the function needs to remove the extra double quotes around the property values in the generated command list.

### Corrected Function
```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, '{0}={1}'.format(prop, val)]  # Removed unnecessary double quotes
    return command
``` 

After implementing this correction, the function should now correctly construct the command list without extra quotes, matching the expected output in the failing tests.
