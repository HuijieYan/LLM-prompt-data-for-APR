### Analysis
The function `_dict_arg` is intended to convert a dictionary into a list of command line arguments. The bug in the function is related to how key-value pairs from the dictionary are handled. Currently, the function is adding quotes around the values in the command, which is leading to the comparison failures in the test cases.

### Bug Explanation
1. In the first failing test case, the expected dictionary value is `{'Prop': 'Value'}`, and the expected command list is `['--conf', 'Prop=Value']`. The bug in this case is that the function is adding quotes around the value `'Value'`, resulting in `['--conf', '"Prop=Value"']` which leads to the assertion error.

2. In the second failing test case, the expected dictionary value is `{'prop1': 'val1'}`, and the expected command list is `['--conf', 'prop1=val1']`. The bug here is similar to the first case where the function is adding unnecessary quotes leading to the assertion error.

### Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to modify the `_dict_arg` function to avoid adding unnecessary quotes around the property values when creating the command list.

### Corrected Version
```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, '{0}={1}'.format(prop, val)]
    return command
``` 

By removing the unnecessary quotes around `{1}` in the `'{0}={1}'` format string, we ensure that the correct command list is generated without the quotes. This corrected version should pass the failing test cases.
