### Analysis
1. The function `_dict_arg` is expected to take a dictionary as input, iterate over its key-value pairs, and construct a list of strings representing command line arguments.
2. The error messages indicate that the function is not handling the dictionary values correctly, leading to unexpected behavior when constructing the command list.
3. The bug seems to be related to the formatting of the values in the dictionary; they are being incorrectly enclosed in double quotes, causing discrepancies in the output compared to the expected values.
4. To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the values from the dictionary are extracted without quotes and formatted correctly in the command list.

### Bug Fix Strategy
1. Modify the function to extract the key and value from the dictionary without enclosing the value in double quotes.
2. Ensure that the format used to construct each command element matches the expected format.

### Corrected Version
```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, prop_value in value.items():
            # Modify the format of the command string without double quotes
            command += [name, '{0}={1}'.format(prop, prop_value)]
    return command
``` 

By making these changes, the function should now correctly construct the command list without the unnecessary double quotes around the property values. This corrected version should pass the failing test cases and match the expected input/output values.
