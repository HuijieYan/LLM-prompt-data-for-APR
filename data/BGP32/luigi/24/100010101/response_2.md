### Analysis
1. The function `_dict_arg` is supposed to take a dictionary `value` and convert it into a list of command-line arguments with the format `name key=value`.
2. The bug occurs when creating the command list by incorrectly formatting the key-value pairs in the list.

### Bug Explanation
The bug is caused by the implementation of the `command += [name, '"{0}={1}"'.format(prop, value)]` line. This line is incorrectly adding the key-value pair as a single string enclosed in double quotes, leading to a mismatch in the expected and actual command lists.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to adjust how key-value pairs are added to the command list. Instead of enclosing the key-value pairs in double quotes, we should append them as separate items in the list.

### Corrected Version of the Function
```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, prop + '=' + val]
    return command
``` 

By making this change, the function should now correctly build the command list with key-value pairs as separate items. This corrected version should pass the failing tests and satisfy the expected input/output values.
