### Analysis
The buggy function `_dict_arg` is designed to construct a command list from a dictionary input. The issue arises from the formatting of the values in the command list. The function incorrectly adds quotes around the `prop=value` pair, leading to a mismatch in the test cases.

### Bug
The bug in the `_dict_arg` function is that it creates the command list with unnecessary quotes around the `prop=value` pair, causing the test cases to fail.

### Fix
To fix this bug, we need to remove the unnecessary quotes around the `prop=value` pair when constructing the command list.

### Corrected Version
```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, '{0}={1}'.format(prop, val)]
    return command
```

By correcting the formatting in the `_dict_arg` function, the test cases should pass successfully.
