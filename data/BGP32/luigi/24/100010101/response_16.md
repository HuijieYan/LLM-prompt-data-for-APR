The buggy function `_dict_arg` is supposed to convert a dictionary value into a list of command arguments. The bug here is related to how the function handles the dictionary items and formats the string for command arguments.

The issue arises from how the function is constructing the command list by adding `" "` around the value. This results in an incorrect format when comparing the lists in the test cases.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the function to properly format the command arguments without adding extra quotation marks around the values.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, '{0}={1}'.format(prop, val)]
    return command
```

This corrected version does not add extra quotes around the values in the command list, which should resolve the issues seen in the failing test cases.
