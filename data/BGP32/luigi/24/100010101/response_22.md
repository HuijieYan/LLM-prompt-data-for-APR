### Bug Analysis:
The bug in the `_dict_arg` function is caused by the function incorrectly adding quotation marks around the property values in the `command` list. This behavior is not expected as the values in the command list should not be enclosed in quotes.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix this bug, we need to remove the unnecessary quotation marks around the property values before appending them to the `command` list.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, '{0}={1}'.format(prop, val)]
    return command
```

With this corrected version of the function, the function should now correctly handle dictionary values without adding unnecessary quotation marks around the property values.
