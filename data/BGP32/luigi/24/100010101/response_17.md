### Analysis
The buggy function `_dict_arg` is intended to process a dictionary `value` into a list of command arguments. The issue arises from the way the function handles the values in the dictionary. Currently, the function adds quotes around the values, which is causing the test failures as the test cases expect the values without quotes.

### Bug Cause
The bug is caused by the buggy function adding quotes around the values in the dictionary, resulting in a mismatch with the expected values in the test cases.

### Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, the function should append the arguments to the `command` list without quotes. This will align the output of the function with the expected values in the test cases.

### Corrected Function
```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, '{0}={1}'.format(prop, val)]
    return command
```

By removing the unnecessary quotes around the values when constructing the command arguments, the corrected function should now pass the failing test scenarios.
