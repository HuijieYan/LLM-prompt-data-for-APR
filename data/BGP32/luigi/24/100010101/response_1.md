### Analysis
The buggy function `_dict_arg` is intended to take a dictionary `value` and convert it into a list `command` of command line arguments. However, the bug occurs when adding the key-value pairs to the `command` list. The bug seems to be related to the formatting of the key-value pairs within the list.

### Error Cause
The error message indicates that the format of the key-value pairs in the list `command` is incorrect. The key-value pairs are being added in a format with double quotes around the value, which causes a mismatch with the expected format in the test cases.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to modify how the key-value pairs are added to the `command` list. Instead of including the double quotes around the value, we should directly concatenate the key and value in the format `prop=value`.

### Corrected Version
```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, "{0}={1}".format(prop, val)]
    return command
```

By making this change, the corrected `_dict_arg` function should now properly format the key-value pairs without including unnecessary double quotes. This should align with the expected output in the failing test cases.
