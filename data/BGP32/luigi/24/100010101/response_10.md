### Bug Analysis
The buggy function `_dict_arg` is intended to process a dictionary input by converting each key-value pair into a string format. The bug appears to be related to how this conversion is handled, leading to extra quotation marks around the values in the output list. This causes the failing tests to report differences in the format of the generated strings.

### Bug Explanation
The bug occurs because the buggy function includes unnecessary double quotes around the formatted key-value pairs in the output list. This leads to a mismatch when compared with the expected output during the test cases, where the values should not be enclosed in quotes.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we should remove the unnecessary double quotes from the generated strings in the output list. The `'{0}={1}'.format(prop, value)` part already correctly formats the key-value pair, so there is no need for additional quotation marks.

### Corrected Version of the Function
```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, '{0}={1}'.format(prop, val)]
    return command
```

By removing the quotation marks from around `'{0}={1}'.format(prop, value)`, we ensure that the key-value pairs are correctly formatted without unnecessary characters in the output list. This corrected version should resolve the bug and pass the failing tests.
