### Explanation:
The buggy function `_dict_arg` is iterating over the input dictionary `value` and adding key-value pairs to the `command` list. However, it is incorrectly formatting the key-value pairs. It is adding extra double quotes around the value while creating the command list. This extra double quotes cause the assertions to fail in the test cases as the expected values are just strings without double quotes.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to remove the extra double quotes around the value inside the `format` function when creating the command list.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():  # Changed variable name to val to avoid conflict
            command += [name, '{0}={1}'.format(prop, val)]  # Removed extra quotes around {1}
    return command
```
