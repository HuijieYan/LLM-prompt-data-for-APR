### Analysis
The buggy function `_dict_arg` is supposed to convert a dictionary into a list of command arguments. The issue seems to be with the format of the arguments being added to the `command` list within the function. The incorrect format leads to differences in the lists when compared in the test cases.

### Bug Cause
The bug in the function arises from the incorrect handling of dictionary key-value pairs when constructing the command list. The function incorrectly formats the key-value pair with double quotes, leading to a mismatch in the comparison with the expected output.

### Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the key-value pairs are not enclosed in double quotes when constructing the command list.

### Corrected Version
```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, '{0}={1}'.format(prop, val)]
    return command
```

This corrected version removes the double quotes around the key-value pairs in the command list, aligning with the expected values in the test cases.
