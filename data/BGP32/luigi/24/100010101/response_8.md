### Analysis
The buggy function `_dict_arg` is intended to convert a dictionary `value` into a list `command` where each key-value pair in the dictionary becomes a string element in the list. However, the current implementation adds extra quotes around the values, leading to discrepancies when comparing the expected and actual outputs in the test cases.

### Bug
The bug lies in the line where the value is formatted with double quotes: `'"{0}={1}"'.format(prop, value)`. This formatting adds extra quotes around the value in the resulting string.

### Fix
To fix the bug, we need to remove the extra quotes from the formatted string when appending to the `command` list.

### Corrected Version
```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():  # renamed value to val to avoid conflict
            command += [name, '{0}={1}'.format(prop, val)]  # removed extra quotes
    return command
```
