### Analysis:
The buggy function `_dict_arg` is intended to process a dictionary `value` by iterating through its key-value pairs and creating a list of command arguments. The bug in the function is that it is incorrectly wrapping the values with double quotes within the list for command arguments.

The error messages indicate that the expected commands are missing the double quotes around certain values, leading to a mismatch in the comparison.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is caused by the incorrect format of the command entries in the list `command`. The function mistakenly adds double quotes around the values in the command list, causing a mismatch with the expected values.

### Bug Fix:
To fix the bug, we need to modify the function to append the command arguments without the double quotes around the values.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, "{0}={1}".format(prop, val)]
    return command
```

In the corrected version, we are formatting the command arguments without the double quotes around the values, ensuring that the output matches the expected values.
