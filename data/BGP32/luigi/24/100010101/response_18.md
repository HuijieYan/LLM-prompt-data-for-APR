The bug in the `_dict_arg` function is due to the incorrect formatting of the command list when dealing with dictionary values. It incorrectly adds double quotes around the values, causing the assertion errors in the test cases.

To fix this bug, we need to remove the unnecessary double quotes around the dictionary values while constructing the command list.

Here is the corrected version of the `_dict_arg` function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, '{0}={1}'.format(prop, val)]
    return command
```

This corrected version directly formats the properties and values without adding extra quotes, which will match the expected values in the test cases provided.
