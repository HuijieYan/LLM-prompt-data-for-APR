The bug in the `_dict_arg` function is caused by the incorrect formatting of key-value pairs when constructing the command list. The function is wrapping the values in double quotes unnecessarily, leading to a mismatch in the expected and actual command lists.
To fix this bug, we need to remove the unnecessary double quotes around the values when constructing the command list.

Here is the corrected version of the `_dict_arg` function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, '{0}={1}'.format(prop, val)]
    return command
```

This correction removes the double quotes around the values in the command list and should now produce the correct output for both test cases.
