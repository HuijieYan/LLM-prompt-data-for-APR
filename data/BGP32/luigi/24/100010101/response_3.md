### Explanation:
The bug in the `_dict_arg` function is caused by the way the function constructs the command list when dealing with key-value pairs from a dictionary. The bug is due to the function wrapping the value inside double quotes even though it is unnecessary.

In both test cases, the expected command list does not have the values in the dictionary wrapped inside double quotes, while the buggy function adds unnecessary double quotes around the values, leading to assertion errors in the tests.

### Strategy for fixing the bug:
To fix the bug, we need to modify the `_dict_arg` function to construct the command list without adding unnecessary double quotes around the values in the dictionary. This can be achieved by updating the code to format the command list entries directly without adding additional quotation marks.

### Corrected version of the function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, '{0}={1}'.format(prop, val)]
    return command
```

By removing the unnecessary double quotes around the value in the `'{0}={1}'.format(prop, val)` format statement, the corrected function will now construct the command list correctly without adding the extra quotes.

The corrected version of the function should now pass the failing tests and satisfy the expected input/output values.
