### Bug Analysis
The buggy function `_dict_arg` is intended to convert a dictionary into a list of command line arguments. However, there is a bug where the values in the dictionary are being formatted as strings surrounded by double quotes, which is not the correct format for command line arguments. This is causing the test cases to fail as the expected values do not match the actual values generated by the function.

### Bug Explanation
The bug occurs because the function is formatting the dictionary values using `'"{0}={1}"'.format(prop, value)`, which adds double quotes around the value. This causes the generated command line arguments to include the values surrounded by quotes, leading to discrepancies with the expected values in the test cases.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to modify the way the dictionary values are processed in the function. We should only include the key and value without any surrounding quotes when creating the command line arguments. This will ensure that the generated command line arguments match the expected values.

### Corrected Code
```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, '{0}={1}'.format(prop, val)]
    return command
``` 

By removing the double quotes around the formatted value, the function should now correctly generate command line arguments from the input dictionary. This corrected version should pass the failing test cases.
