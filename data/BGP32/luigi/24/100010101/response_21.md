### Analysis
The buggy function `_dict_arg` is supposed to take a dictionary `value` and format it into a list of command line arguments. The issue arises from incorrectly handling the dictionary key-value pairs. The function is adding extra quotes around the property and value, causing the test cases to fail.

### Bug Explanation
- In the first test case, the function is adding quotes around the property and value when constructing the command list, resulting in an assertion failure due to the mismatch in formatting.
- In the second test case, a similar issue occurs with a different property and value pair.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the property and value are added directly without additional quotes to the command list.

### Corrected Version

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, '{0}={1}'.format(prop, val)]
    return command
``` 

With this correction, the function will format the property and value pairs correctly without adding extra quotes, allowing the test cases to pass successfully.
