### Analysis
- The buggy function `_dict_arg` is intended to convert a dictionary into a list of command line arguments.
- The issue seems to be related to how the function handles key-value pairs within the dictionary.
- The error messages indicate that the function is including unnecessary double quotes around the values when forming the command list.
- This is likely causing the discrepancy when comparing the expected command list in the test cases.

### Bug Cause
- The bug in the function is the unnecessary addition of double quotes around the values when formatting each key-value pair in the dictionary.
- This causes the actual list of command line arguments to contain the values enclosed in double quotes, leading to a mismatch with the expected output.

### Fix Strategy
- To fix the bug, we need to remove the unnecessary double quotes while formatting the key-value pairs in the command list.
- We can achieve this by directly formatting the key and value without surrounding them with double quotes.

### Corrected Version
```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, '{0}={1}'.format(prop, val)]
    return command
```
