### Analysis
1. The function `_dict_arg` is supposed to convert a dictionary input into a list of command arguments.
2. The error messages indicate that the function is not formatting the dictionary values correctly, leading to assertion failures in the tests.
3. The cause of the bug is that the function is incorrectly enclosing the property-value pairs in quotes, causing a mismatch with the expected output.
4. To fix the bug, we need to remove the unnecessary quotes around the property-value pairs in the command list.

### Solution
1. Modify the function to remove the quotes around the property-value pairs in the command list.
2. Update the function to correctly format the command list based on the dictionary input.
3. Ensure that the function handles empty or non-dictionary inputs gracefully.

### Corrected Version of the Function

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command.extend([name, '{0}={1}'.format(prop, val)])
    return command
```

After applying these changes, the function should correctly format the command list without unnecessary quotes, addressing the issues reported in the failing tests.
