The bug in the provided function `_dict_arg` is that it incorrectly handles the dictionary values when constructing the command list. It wraps the property value in double quotes which causes the test cases to fail due to mismatch in the format of the expected and actual values. 

To fix this bug, we should remove the double quotes from around the property value in the command list construction.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, "{0}={1}".format(prop, val)]
    return command
    
```

This correction ensures that the property value is added to the command list without any additional quotes, matching the expected values from the test cases. This should resolve the issue and make the function produce the correct output for the given test cases.
