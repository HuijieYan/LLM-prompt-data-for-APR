### Analysis
The buggy function `_dict_arg` is supposed to format a dictionary into a list of strings in a specific format. The bug seems to be related to the way the function handles key-value pairs from the dictionary parameter.

The error messages indicate that the function is adding additional quotation marks around the values of the properties when formatting them, leading to discrepancies in the comparison. This is causing the tests to fail as the expected and actual outputs do not match due to the extra quotes.

### Bug Cause
The bug is caused by the function adding quotation marks around the formatted key-value pairs from the dictionary when building the command list. This formatting is inconsistent with the expected input format, leading to the test failures.

### Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to modify the `_dict_arg` function to correctly format the key-value pairs without adding additional quotation marks around the values. This can be achieved by excluding the quotation marks in the format string.

### Corrected Version
```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, '{0}={1}'.format(prop, val)]
    return command
```

By using `{0}={1}` in the format method instead of `"{0}={1}"`, we ensure that the key-value pairs are formatted without unnecessary quotation marks. This corrected version should resolve the bug and allow the function to produce the expected output for the given test cases.
