The bug in the provided function `_dict_arg` is due to the incorrect formatting of key-value pairs in the command list. The function is adding unnecessary double quotes around the values when constructing the command list, leading to a mismatch with the expected values during the test cases.

To fix this bug, we need to remove the extra quotes around the values while constructing the command list.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, '{0}={1}'.format(prop, val)]
    return command
```

By removing the extra double quotes around the values in the command list construction, the function should now generate the correct command list and pass the failing test cases.
