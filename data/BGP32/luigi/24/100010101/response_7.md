### Analysis
1. The `_dict_arg` function takes a `name` and `value` as input parameters. It constructs a list `command` based on the key-value pairs in the input `value` dictionary.
2. The error messages indicate a mismatch in the formatting of the key-value pairs in the `command` list compared to the expected output.
3. The cause of the bug seems to be the incorrect formatting of the key-value pairs in the `command` list. The values are enclosed in double quotes and the format does not match the expected output.
4. To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the key-value pairs are correctly formatted without unnecessary quotes.
5. Below is the corrected version of the `_dict_arg` function:

### Corrected Version
```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, "{0}={1}".format(prop, val)]
    return command
```

By avoiding the unnecessary double quotes in the key-value pairs, the corrected version should now generate the `command` list in the expected format. This should resolve the formatting mismatch issues in the test cases.
