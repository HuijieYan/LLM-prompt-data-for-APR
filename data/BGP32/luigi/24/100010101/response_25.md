### Analysis
The buggy function `_dict_arg` is intended to convert a dictionary into a list of command arguments. The issues seem to be related to the handling of the dictionary items, specifically with respect to quoting the key-value pairs.

The function incorrectly quotes the key-value pairs when creating the command arguments, leading to a mismatch in the expected output compared to the actual output in the test cases.

### Bug Cause
The bug is caused by the unnecessary quoting of key-value pairs in the command list. The function should simply include the key and value without additional quotes.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug
1. Check if the value is a dictionary and iterate over its items.
2. Append the key and value of each item directly (without additional quotes) to the `command` list.

### Corrected Version
```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, value in value.items():
            command += [name, prop + '=' + value]
    return command
```

With this corrected version, the function will correctly generate the command arguments without unnecessary quoting, resolving the mismatch in the test cases.
