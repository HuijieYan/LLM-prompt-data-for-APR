The bug in the provided function is that it is adding extra double quotes around the property value when constructing the command list. This leads to a mismatch in the expected and actual values when tested.

To fix this bug, we need to remove the extra double quotes around the property value while formatting the command list.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: luigi/contrib/spark.py

def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, '{0}={1}'.format(prop, val)]
    return command
```

By removing the unnecessary double quotes around the property value in the command list construction, the corrected function should now return the expected values as mentioned in the test cases.
