### Bug Analysis
The bug in the `_dict_arg` function is due to the fact that when building the `command` list, the value associated with a property in the dictionary is being appended with double quotes. This results in a mismatch with the expected format of the command list.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix this bug, we need to remove the double quotes around the property value when appending it to the `command` list.

### Corrected Function
```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, '{}={}'.format(prop, val)]
    
    return command
``` 

### Justification
By removing the double quotes around the property value when constructing the command list, the corrected `dict_arg` function will produce the expected output format, fixing the bug. This corrected function will now pass the failing tests.
