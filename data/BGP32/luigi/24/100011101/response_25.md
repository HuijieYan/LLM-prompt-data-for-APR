### Bug Analysis:
The bug in the `_dict_arg` function is that when constructing the command list, it is incorrectly treating the values as strings when adding them to the list. This causes an issue when comparing the generated command list with the expected command list in the failing test cases. The bug occurs because the values inside the dictionary are wrapped in double quotes which should not be the case.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the values from the dictionary are added to the command list without any double quotes. This can be achieved by removing the double quotes around the format string in the line `command += [name, '"{0}={1}"'.format(prop, value)]`.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, '{0}={1}'.format(prop, val)]
    return command
```

By making this change, the values from the dictionary will be added to the command list without the unnecessary double quotes, which will align the output with the expected values and resolve the failing test cases.
