### Bug Explanation
The bug in the `_dict_arg` function arises from the way the values are added to the `command` list. The function incorrectly wraps the property and value in double quotes when constructing the command list, causing a mismatch with the expected output.

### Correction Strategy
To fix the bug, we should remove the double quotes when formatting the property and value in the command list.

### Corrected Function
```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, '{0}={1}'.format(prop, val)]
    return command
``` 

By correctly formatting the property and value without quotes, the corrected function will generate the command list as expected and pass the failing tests.
