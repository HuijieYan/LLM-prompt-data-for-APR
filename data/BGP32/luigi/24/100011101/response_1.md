### Bug in the Function
The bug in the function `_dict_arg` arises from the fact that when constructing the command list, the value for a specific property is being enclosed in double quotes (`"`) regardless of whether it is a string or not. This results in the mismatch between the expected and actual values when comparing lists, causing the test failures.

### Fixing the Bug
To fix the bug, we should only enclose the property value in double quotes if it is a string. If the value is not a string, it should be added to the command list as is. This adjustment will ensure that the resulting command list matches the expected values and resolves the test failures.

### Corrected Function
```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, prop_value in value.items():
            if isinstance(prop_value, str):
                command += [name, '{0}="{1}"'.format(prop, prop_value)]
            else:
                command += [name, '{0}={1}'.format(prop, prop_value)]
    return command
```

With this corrected version of the function, the function `_dict_arg` should now properly construct the command list based on the properties and values provided in the input dictionary, resolving the test failures.
