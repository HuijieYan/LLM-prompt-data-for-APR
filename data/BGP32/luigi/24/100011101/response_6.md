### Bug Analysis
The bug in the `_dict_arg` function stems from incorrectly formatting key-value pairs from the dictionary `value` into the `command` list. The buggy function mistakenly includes double quotes around the value, leading to a mismatch when comparing the expected and actual output in the failing tests.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to remove the double quotes around the value when constructing the command list inside the `_dict_arg` function. This adjustment should align the function's output with the expected format and resolve the failing tests.

### Corrected Version of the Function
```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, '{0}={1}'.format(prop, val)]
    return command
``` 

### Justification
In the corrected version of the function, the formatting of the key-value pairs within the `value` dictionary is done using the correct format without enclosing the value within double quotes. This change ensures that the output `command` list matches the expected format specified in the failing tests, resolving the bug.
