### Bug Explanation:
The bug in the provided function is that when constructing the command list, the function is adding the property-value pairs with quotes around the values. This leads to a mismatch between the expected and actual command lists since the expected values in the test cases do not contain the quotes.

### Bug Fix:
To fix the bug, we need to remove the quotes around the property values when constructing the command list.

### Corrected Function:
```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, '{0}={1}'.format(prop, val)]
    return command
``` 

This corrected function will construct the command list without enclosing the property values in quotes, which aligns with the expected values in the failing test cases.
