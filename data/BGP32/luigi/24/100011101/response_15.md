The issue in the provided function lies in the way the dictionary items are processed and concatenated to the command list. The current implementation wraps the property value in double quotes, leading to a mismatch when compared to the expected values in the failing tests.

To fix this issue, we need to modify how the property-value pairs are formatted in the command list. It's unnecessary to wrap each property value in double quotes. Instead, we should directly concatenate the property and value without any additional characters.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, '{0}={1}'.format(prop, val)]
    return command
```

By making this change, the function will correctly format the property-value pairs in the command list without unnecessary double quotes. This will ensure that the function behaves as expected and passes the failing tests.
