The bug in the function `_dict_arg` is caused by incorrectly formatting the dictionary values when constructing the `command` list. The function adds unnecessary double quotes around the property-value pairs from the dictionary.

To fix the bug, we need to remove the extra quotes when building the command list. Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, "{0}={1}".format(prop, val)]  # Remove unnecessary quotes here
    return command
```

By making this change, the function will correctly construct the command list without additional quotation marks around the property-value pairs. This adjustment will ensure that the function output matches the expected values in the failing tests.
