### Bug Explanation
The bug in the `_dict_arg` function arises from how the values from the dictionary are being handled. The function is incorrectly adding quotes around the property and value when constructing the command list. This leads to a mismatch between the expected and actual values in the test cases.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to remove the unnecessary quotes around the property and value when constructing the command list. This will ensure that the command list is constructed correctly without extra quotes that cause the test failures.

### Corrected Version of the Function
```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, '{0}={1}'.format(prop, val)]
    return command
```

By removing the quotes around `{0}={1}`, we can construct the command list correctly without additional quotes around the property and value. This corrected version should pass the failing test cases.
