### Bug Explanation
The bug in the `_dict_arg` function lies in how it handles formatting the dictionary key-value pairs into command line arguments. Currently, it is enclosing the values in double quotes, causing them to be represented as strings in the final command list. This behavior is not desired as command line arguments do not require values to be enclosed in quotes.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to modify the way the key-value pairs are added to the `command` list by removing the unnecessary double quotes around the values.

### Corrected Function
```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, '{0}={1}'.format(prop, val)]  # Removed unnecessary double quotes around the value
    return command
``` 

By making this change, the corrected function will properly format the key-value pairs from the input dictionary without enclosing the values in quotes. This updated version should pass the failing tests and match the expected input/output values.
