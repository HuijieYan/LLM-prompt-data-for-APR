### Bug Explanation
The bug in the `_dict_arg` function arises from adding quotes around the `value` when constructing the command list. This extra quoting is unnecessary and leads to a mismatch in the expected and actual lists in the failing tests.

### Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, remove the unnecessary quoting around the `value` when adding it to the command list.

### Corrected Version
```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, '{0}={1}'.format(prop, val)]
    return command
``` 

The corrected version eliminates the unnecessary double quoting around the `value` variable, leading to the construction of the command list without additional quotes. This change ensures that the function returns the command list in the expected format, resolving the bug in the function.
