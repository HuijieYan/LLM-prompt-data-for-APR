### Bug Analysis:
The bug occurs because the `_dict_arg` function incorrectly adds quotes around the property-value pair when constructing the command list. This behavior causes the command list to include unnecessary double quotes around the property-value pair, leading to a mismatch in the expected and actual values.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to modify the `_dict_arg` function to correctly construct the command list without adding quotes around the property-value pair when the value is a dictionary.

### Corrected Function:
```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, '{0}={1}'.format(prop, val)]
    return command
```

By removing the unnecessary double quotes when formatting the property-value pair, the corrected function should now correctly construct the command list without the unwanted quotes. This fix should address the failing tests and ensure that the expected and actual values match.
