### Bug Explanation
The bug in the `_dict_arg` function arises from the fact that the function is adding unnecessary double quotes around the property and value when constructing the command list. This leads to a mismatch between the expected command list and the actual command list, causing the test to fail.

### Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to remove the double quotes around the property and value when constructing the command list. This will ensure that the constructed command list matches the expected command list.

### Corrected Version of the Function

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, '{0}={1}'.format(prop, val)]
    return command
``` 

By making this change, the function will now construct the command list without unnecessary double quotes, ensuring that it matches the expected command list and passes the failing tests.
