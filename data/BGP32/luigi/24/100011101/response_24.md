### Bug Analysis
The bug arises from the fact that the function `_dict_arg` is incorrectly formatting the `value` of a dictionary parameter. Instead of just including the value itself, it wraps it in double quotes, causing a mismatch in the expected and actual results during testing.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to make sure that when constructing the `command` list, the values from the dictionary are added without quotes around them.

### Corrected Function
```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():  # Changed variable name from value to val
            command += [name, '{0}={1}'.format(prop, val)]  # Removed unnecessary quotes around val
    return command
``` 

By removing the quotes around `val` when constructing the `command` list, we ensure that the function now correctly assembles the elements without causing a mismatch during testing.
