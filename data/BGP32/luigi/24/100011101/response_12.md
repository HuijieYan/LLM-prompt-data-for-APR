The issue in the buggy function is related to the way the values are inserted into the `command` list. The function is incorrectly adding extra quotes around the property name and value when constructing the command list. This causes discrepancies when comparing the expected output with the actual output in the tests.

To fix this bug, we need to remove the unnecessary quotes when constructing the command list.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, '{0}={1}'.format(prop, val)]
    return command
```

By making this change, the function correctly generates the command list without unnecessary quotes, and the tests should now pass as expected.
