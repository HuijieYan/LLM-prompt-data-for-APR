The bug in the `_dict_arg` function arises from an incorrect handling of dictionary values where the values are not properly formatted when added to the `command` list. The values in the dictionary are being enclosed in double quotes, causing a mismatch with the expected output in the failing tests.

To fix the bug, we should remove the unnecessary double quotes around the values when constructing the command list.

Here is the corrected version of the `_dict_arg` function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, "{0}={1}".format(prop, val)]
    return command
```

With this correction, the function should now correctly build the command list without unnecessary double quotes. This fix aligns the output with the expected values in the failing tests and resolves the bug.
