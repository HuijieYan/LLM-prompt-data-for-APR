### Bug Analysis
In the provided `buggy` function, the issue stems from incorrectly quoting the property=value pair in the command list. The function erroneously adds extra quotes around the property=value pair when constructing the command list. This results in an inconsistency between the expected output and the actual output.

### Bug's Cause
The bug arises from the usage of double quotes around the property=value pair when constructing the command list. This causes the command list to contain the property=value pair as a single string enclosed in quotes, leading to a mismatch with the expected output.

### Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to remove the unnecessary double quotes around the property=value pair while constructing the command list. This will ensure that the property=value pair is correctly added to the list without additional quoting.

### Corrected Version of the Function
```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, '{0}={1}'.format(prop, val)]
    return command
```

By removing the unnecessary quotes around the property=value pair, the corrected function ensures that the command list is constructed correctly, matching the expected output values.
