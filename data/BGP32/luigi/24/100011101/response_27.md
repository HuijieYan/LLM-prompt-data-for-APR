### Bug Explanation
The bug in the `_dict_arg` function arises from the incorrect formatting of key-value pairs when creating the command list. The function currently formats the key and value with double quotes, which results in a mismatch with the expected output. The test cases expect the key and value to be concatenated without quotes.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to remove the double quotes around the formatted key-value pairs in the command list. This will align the output with the expected format.

### Corrected Function
```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, '{0}={1}'.format(prop, val)]
    return command
``` 

By removing the double quotes around `"{0}={1}"`, the corrected function will produce the expected output format without quotes around the key-value pairs.
