### Bug Analysis
The bug in the `_dict_arg` function is related to how the function handles dictionary values when constructing a list of command arguments. The function attempts to add key-value pairs from the dictionary as string elements in the command list. However, it encloses the values in double quotes, leading to a mismatch with the expected values in the test cases.

### Bug Explanation
1. In Case 1, the function incorrectly adds the value from the dictionary enclosed in double quotes, resulting in `'"Prop=Value"'`. However, the expected value should be `'Prop=Value'`. This mistake leads to the assertion failure in the test case.
   
2. In Case 2, a similar issue occurs where the function adds the dictionary value surrounded by double quotes, leading to `'"prop1=val1"'` instead of `'prop1=val1'`, causing the test case to fail.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, the function should add the key and value from the dictionary directly without enclosing the value in double quotes. By correctly constructing the command list with the key-value pairs as strings without quotes, the function will align with the expected output values from the test cases.

### Corrected Function
```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, '{0}={1}'.format(prop, val)]
    return command
```

After making this correction, the function will correctly construct the command list with key-value pairs from the dictionary without the unnecessary double quotes, ensuring the expected output values match the actual output values in the test cases.
