### Bug Explanation
The bug in the `_dict_arg` function lies in how the `value` dictionary is processed. When constructing the `command` list, the values from the dictionary are being enclosed in double quotes, resulting in incorrect formatting when compared to the expected values.

### Fix Strategy
To fix this bug, the values from the dictionary should be concatenated directly without enclosing them in double quotes. This way, the resulting command list will match the expected values.

### Corrected Function
```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, '{0}={1}'.format(prop, val)]
    return command
```

Now, with this corrected function, the output should match the expected values for both cases provided.
