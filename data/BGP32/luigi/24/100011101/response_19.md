### Bug Analysis:
- The bug in the `_dict_arg` function stems from the incorrect formatting when adding key-value pairs from the `value` dictionary to the `command` list.
- The function currently adds the key-value pairs within quotes, resulting in incorrect formatting when comparing the output with the expected values.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
- To fix the bug, the key-value pairs should be added without quotes to ensure they match the expected values.
- Additionally, the function should handle cases where the key-value pairs might not need to be enclosed in quotes.

### Corrected Function:
```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, '{0}={1}'.format(prop, val)]
    return command
``` 

By making the above changes, the corrected function should now properly format the key-value pairs as expected.
