### Bug Explanation
The bug in the `_dict_arg` function lies in how the key-value pairs from the input dictionary `value` are processed. The current implementation wraps the values in double quotes, which is causing the test failures due to mismatched string formats in the command list.

The error messages indicate that the function is incorrectly adding double quotes around the property values when constructing the command list. This leads to a formatting mismatch between the expected and actual command lists, causing the test failures.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to update the `_dict_arg` function to construct the command list without adding double quotes around the property values. This modification will align the function's behavior with the expected output format, resolving the test failures.

### Corrected Implementation
```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():  # Changed variable name to 'val' to avoid shadowing
            command += [name, '{0}={1}'.format(prop, val)]  # Removed double quotes around {0}={1}
    return command
```

By removing the double quotes from the generated string format in the `command` list, the corrected implementation ensures that the command list is constructed correctly without any mismatched string formats. This fix should address the test failures and produce the expected output.
