The issue in the buggy function arises from adding extra double quotes around the property and value when forming the command list. This leads to a mismatch between the expected and actual values in the test cases.

To fix this issue, we need to remove the extra double quotes when formatting the property and value pair before adding it to the command list.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, '{0}={1}'.format(prop, val)]
    return command
```

By removing the extra double quotes in the formatting of the property and value pair, the function will correctly generate the command list without additional string manipulations. This should align the function's behavior with the expected values in the test cases, resolving the mismatch and passing the failing tests.
