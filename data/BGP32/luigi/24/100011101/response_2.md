The issue in the buggy function arises from the way the key-value pairs from the input dictionary `value` are being processed and added to the `command` list. The current implementation mistakenly includes the key-value pairs within double quotes, which is causing the assertion errors in the test cases.

To fix this issue, we need to modify how the key-value pairs are formatted when added to the `command` list. By removing the double quotes around the values, we can ensure that the elements in the `command` list match the expected format.

Below is the corrected version of the `_dict_arg` function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():  # Change the variable name from value to val to avoid conflict
            command += [name, '{0}={1}'.format(prop, val)]  # Remove double quotes around the value
    return command
```

With this correction, the function should now correctly format the key-value pairs from the input dictionary without using double quotes around the values.

This corrected version should pass the failing test cases and generate the expected output.
