### Bug Explanation
The bug in the `_dict_arg` function arises from the fact that when constructing the command list, the function wraps the property-value pairs in double quotes, causing the assertion errors in the test cases. The function incorrectly includes double quotes around the property-value pairs within the command list, leading to discrepancies when comparing the expected and actual output.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, remove the unnecessary double quotes around the property-value pairs when constructing the command list. This way, the expected output will match the actual output without any extra characters.

### Corrected Version of the Function
```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, "{0}={1}".format(prop, val)]
    return command
``` 

By making this change, the function will correctly construct the command list without unnecessary double quotes, resolving the assertion errors in the failing test cases.
