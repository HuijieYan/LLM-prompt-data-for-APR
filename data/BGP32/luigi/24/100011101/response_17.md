The bug in the `_dict_arg` function is caused by the unnecessary use of double quotes around the property values when constructing the command list. The expected output does not include the property values enclosed in double quotes, which is causing the assertion errors in the test cases.

To fix this bug, we need to remove the double quotes around the property values when formatting the command string. Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, '{0}={1}'.format(prop, val)]
    return command
```

This corrected version of the function should now pass the failing test cases and produce the expected output. Let me know if you need any more assistance.
