### Bug Explanation
The bug in the `_dict_arg` function stems from incorrectly adding quotation marks around the property-value pair when constructing the command array. The function erroneously adds double quotes around the value within the command array, resulting in a mismatch between the actual command list and the expected command list in the failing test cases.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we should remove the unnecessary double quotes around the property-value pair when constructing the command array. This will align the actual command list with the expected command list provided in the failing test cases.

### Corrected Version of the Function
```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, "{0}={1}".format(prop, val)]
    return command
``` 

By removing the unnecessary double quotes around the property-value pair, the corrected function should now construct the command array correctly, resolving the issue seen in the failing test cases.
