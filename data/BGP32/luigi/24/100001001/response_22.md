### Bug Explanation
The bug in the `_dict_arg` function arises from reusing the variable name `value` inside the for loop, which overrides the original `value` passed as a parameter. This causes the function to incorrectly use the inner loop `value` instead of the outer one for constructing the command list.

### Bug Fix
To fix this bug, we need to use a different variable name in the for loop to avoid overwriting the original `value`. We can simply change the inner loop variable name from `value` to something else like `val` to ensure the function behaves as intended.

### Corrected Version
```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, '"{0}={1}"'.format(prop, val)]
    return command
``` 

By making this change, we avoid modifying the outer `value` variable inadvertently, ensuring that the correct values are used to construct the command list.
