The bug in the function `_dict_arg` lies in the fact that the loop variable `value` is being used both as the loop iterator and as the value retrieved from the dictionary `value.items()`. This is causing the issue where the value is being overwritten and leading to incorrect output.

To fix this bug, it is important to differentiate between the loop iterator variable and the value retrieved from the dictionary. One way to solve this is by using separate variable names for these two purposes.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, '"{0}={1}"'.format(prop, val)]
    return command
```

By using `val` as the loop variable to store the value from the dictionary, we avoid overwriting the value variable and ensure correct output based on the input dictionary values.
