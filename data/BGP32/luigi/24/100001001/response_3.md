### Explanation:
The bug in the provided function is that it reuses the variable name `value` both as a loop variable and as an input parameter. This causes the input parameter value to be overwritten and leads to incorrect behavior in the function.

### Strategy for fixing the bug:
To fix the bug, we need to rename the loop variable within the `for` loop so that it doesn't conflict with the input parameter `value`.

### Corrected version of the function:
```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():  # renaming the loop variable from value to val
            command += [name, '"{0}={1}"'.format(prop, val)]
    return command
``` 

With this correction, the loop variable `value` will not overwrite the input parameter `value`, eliminating the bug that caused incorrect behavior in the function.
