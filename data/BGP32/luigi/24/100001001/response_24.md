### Bug Explanation
The bug in the `_dict_arg` function lies in the fact that the inner loop variable `value` is being overwritten by the loop iteration variable `value`. This causes incorrect values to be appended to the `command` list.

### Bug Fix
To fix the bug, we need to use a different variable name for the loop iteration variable, so it doesn't overwrite the dictionary value. 

### Corrected Version
```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, '"{0}={1}"'.format(prop, val)]
    return command
``` 

By changing `value` to `val` inside the loop, we ensure that the original value remains intact and the correct key-value pairs are appended to the `command` list.
