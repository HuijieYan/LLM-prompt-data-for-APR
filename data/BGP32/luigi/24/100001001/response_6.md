### Bug Explanation
The bug in the `_dict_arg` function lies in the fact that the function reuses the variable name `value` both as the input parameter and as a loop variable inside the loop. This leads to the original `value` being overwritten and causing incorrect behavior in constructing the `command` list.

### Bug Fix
To fix this bug, we need to rename the loop variable from `value` to something else to avoid overwriting the original `value` input parameter.

### Corrected Version
```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():  # Renamed value to val to prevent overwriting
            command += [name, '"{0}={1}"'.format(prop, val)]
    return command
```
