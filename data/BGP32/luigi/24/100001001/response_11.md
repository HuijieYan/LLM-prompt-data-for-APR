The bug in the provided function `_dict_arg` is caused by reusing the variable name `value` for both the input argument and the loop variable, leading to unintended overwriting and incorrect value assignments within the loop. 

To fix the bug, we need to use a different variable name within the loop to prevent overwriting the original `value`. Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, '"{0}={1}"'.format(prop, val)]
    return command
```

By changing `value` to `val` as the loop variable, we ensure that the original `value` is not overwritten, and each key-value pair from the input dictionary is correctly appended to the `command` list.
