### Explanation:
The bug in the `_dict_arg` function lies in the fact that the loop variable name `value` is being overwritten by the loop iteration variable `value` in the `for prop, value in value.items():` loop. This causes the incorrect behavior where the value of the loop iteration variable `value` is used instead of the value passed as an argument to the function.

### Strategy for fixing the bug:
To fix the bug, we need to rename either the loop iteration variable `value` or the input argument `value` to avoid overwriting. Renaming the loop iteration variable is a cleaner solution to prevent confusion.

### Corrected version of the function:
```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():  # Renamed the loop iteration variable from value to val
            command += [name, '"{0}={1}"'.format(prop, val)]
    return command
```

After making this change, the function should work as expected and correctly construct the command list based on the input dictionary.
