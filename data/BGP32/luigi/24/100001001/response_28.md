The bug in the provided function is due to reusing the variable name "value" for both the input value and the key-value pairs inside the dictionary. This leads to overwriting the original value and key during iteration, causing incorrect output.

To fix the bug, we should rename the variable used for the key-value pairs in the dictionary, for example, changing it to "k" as shown below:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for k, v in value.items():
            command += [name, '"{0}={1}"'.format(k, v)]
    return command
```

By using a different variable name for the key-value pairs in the dictionary, we avoid overwriting the original value and key and generate the correct output.
