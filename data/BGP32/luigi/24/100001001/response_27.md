### Analysis:
The buggy function `_dict_arg` is intended to convert a dictionary input into a list of command arguments. The function iterates over the dictionary items, formats them as strings, and appends them to the `command` list. The issue lies in how the values are being formatted and added to the list, causing incorrect output.

### Potential error locations:
1. The string formatting for the command arguments may not be correct.
2. The way values are added to the `command` list might be incorrect.

### Cause of the bug:
The bug stems from the way the values are being formatted within the function. The format `"{0}={1}"` is adding an additional set of double quotes around the values, leading to incorrect command arguments.

### Strategy for fixing the bug:
To fix the bug, remove the additional double quotes from the formatting of the command arguments. This will ensure the correct format for the command arguments without unnecessary characters.

### Corrected version of the function:
```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, '{0}={1}'.format(prop, val)]
    return command
```

By making the change in the string formatting to `{0}={1}`, we eliminate the additional double quotes around the values, ensuring the correct formation of the command arguments. This correction should address the bug in the function.
