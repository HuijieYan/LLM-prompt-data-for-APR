The bug in the `_dict_arg` function is that it overwrites the variable `value` inside the loop, causing unexpected behavior. 

To fix this bug, we should use a different variable name to avoid overwriting the input `value` parameter. Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, '"{0}={1}"'.format(prop, val)]
    return command
```

By changing `value` to `val` inside the loop, we prevent overwriting the input parameter. This should solve the bug and ensure correct behavior of the function.
