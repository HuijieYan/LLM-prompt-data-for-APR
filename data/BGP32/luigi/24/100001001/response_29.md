### Explanation:
The bug in the provided function lies in the variable names being reused. Specifically, the inner loop uses the variable name `value` both as the iterating variable and the outer function parameter. This causes a conflict and leads to unexpected behavior, resulting in incorrect output.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to avoid reusing variable names within the function to prevent conflicts. This can be achieved by renaming the iterating variable within the loop to avoid shadowing the function parameter `value`.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():  # Rename the iterating variable to 'val'
            command += [name, '"{0}={1}"'.format(prop, val)]
    return command
``` 

By making this change, the function should now correctly iterate over the key-value pairs of the input dictionary and construct the command list as intended.
