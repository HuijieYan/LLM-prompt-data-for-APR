### Explanation of the bug and potential fix strategy
The bug in the provided function lies in the fact that the inner variable `value` is being overwritten by the loop iteration in `for prop, value in value.items():`, which causes incorrect behavior and unexpected outputs.

To fix this bug, we should rename the inner loop variable to avoid the conflict with the outer `value` variable. One common convention is to use `key` instead of `value` in such cases. By doing this, we can prevent the overwriting issue and correctly build the `command` list.

### Corrected version of the function

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, '"{0}={1}"'.format(prop, val)]
    return command
```

By renaming `value` to `val` in the loop, we avoid the conflict issue and ensure that the correct values are used to construct the `command` list. This corrected version should now work as intended.
