### Bug Explanation
The bug in the `_dict_arg` function lies in the fact that the function overwrites the `value` variable used in the loop to extract the property and value pairs from the input `value` dictionary. As a result, the variable `value` is reassigned inside the loop, leading to incorrect values being appended to the `command` list.

### Bug Fix
To fix this bug, we need to use a different variable name inside the loop to store the property and value pairs from the input `value` dictionary. This will prevent the overwriting of the `value` variable that caused the bug.

### Corrected Version
Here is the corrected version of the `_dict_arg` function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():  # Changed variable name from 'value' to 'val'
            command += [name, '"{0}={1}"'.format(prop, val)]
    return command
```

By distinguishing the new variable `val` to store the value of each property in the loop, we prevent the bug that was causing incorrect values to be appended to the `command` list.
