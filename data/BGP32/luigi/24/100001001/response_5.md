### Explanation:
The bug in the function `_dict_arg` is caused by a naming conflict within the for loop. The loop variable `value` is being overlapped with the function parameter `value`, causing unexpected behavior in the loop iteration.

### Strategy for fixing the bug:
To fix the bug, we need to rename the loop variable from `value` to something else that does not conflict with the function parameter name.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, '"{0}={1}"'.format(prop, val)]
    return command
``` 

By renaming the loop variable `value` to `val`, we ensure that there is no overlap with the function parameter `value`, resolving the naming conflict issue.
