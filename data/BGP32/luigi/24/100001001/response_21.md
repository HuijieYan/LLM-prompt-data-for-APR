### Explanation
The bug in the function is caused by the variable names being reused within the loop. The outer `value` parameter is being shadowed by the inner loop variable `value`, leading to incorrect behavior when constructing the `command` list. The issue arises because the loop variable name is the same as the input parameter name.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug
To fix the bug, we need to avoid reusing the variable name `value` within the loop. We can rename the loop variable to something different to prevent shadowing the input parameter.

### Corrected Version
```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():  # rename the loop variable to 'val'
            command += [name, '"{0}={1}"'.format(prop, val)]
    return command
``` 

By renaming the loop variable from `value` to `val`, we prevent the shadowing issue and ensure correct construction of the `command` list.
