### Explanation:
The bug in the provided function lies in the fact that the loop variable `value` is being overwritten inside the loop, causing incorrect values to be appended to the `command` list. This is because both the loop variable `value` and the argument variable `value` have the same name, leading to confusion and incorrect behavior.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, change the variable name in the loop to avoid overwriting the argument variable `value`.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, '"{0}={1}"'.format(prop, val)]
    return command
``` 

By changing `value` to `val` in the loop, we ensure that the loop variable does not conflict with the argument variable, fixing the bug.
