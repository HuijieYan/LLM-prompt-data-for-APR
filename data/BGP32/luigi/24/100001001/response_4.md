### Explanation:
The bug in the provided function lies in the fact that the inner variable name `value` is being used both for the input value and the loop iterator value. This leads to incorrect behavior as the original `value` is being overwritten during the iteration in the loop.

### Strategy for fixing the bug:
To fix the bug, we need to rename the loop iterator variable inside the loop to avoid conflicts with the input parameter `value`. 

### Corrected version of the function:
```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():  # Renamed variable to prevent conflicts
            command += [name, '"{0}={1}"'.format(prop, val)]
    return command
``` 

By making this change, the corrected function should now properly construct the `command` list without overwriting the original `value` parameter.
