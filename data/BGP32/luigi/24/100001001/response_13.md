The bug in the provided function lies in the fact that the loop variable name `value` is conflicting with the input parameter `value`. This leads to unexpected behavior and incorrect results.

To fix the bug, we need to change the loop variable name from `value` to something that won't conflict with the input parameter. Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():  # changed variable name from value to val
            command += [name, '"{0}={1}"'.format(prop, val)]
    return command
```

By changing the loop variable name to `val`, we avoid the conflict with the input parameter `value`. This should resolve the bug and the function should now work correctly for the given test cases.
