### Analysis
The buggy function is intended to convert a dictionary into a list of strings in a specific format. The function iterates over the dictionary items and appends them to the `command` list. However, the bug lies in the re-use of the `value` variable, which leads to incorrect output as observed in the test cases.

### Bug
The bug arises from the re-use of the variable name `value`, where it is being used both as the input parameter and the loop variable within the function. This leads to the overwriting of the initial `value` intended for the dictionary input, causing incorrect output.

### Fix
To fix this bug, the variable used within the loop for iterating over the dictionary should be distinct from the input parameter variable. This separation will prevent the overwriting of the original dictionary values.

### Corrected Version
```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items(): # Use a different variable name 'val' instead of 'value'
            command += [name, '"{0}={1}"'.format(prop, val)] # Use 'val' instead of 'value'
    return command
```

By making the suggested change, the function will correctly iterate over the dictionary items without overwriting the initial `value` parameter.
