The bug in the provided function `_dict_arg` is that it is reusing the variable name `value` for both the input dictionary and the inner loop values. This causes the inner `value` to overwrite the outer `value` variable, leading to incorrect results.

To fix this bug, we should use a different variable name for the inner loop value instead of `value`. Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):

        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, '"{0}={1}"'.format(prop, val)]
    
    return command
```

In this corrected version, we are using `val` as the variable name for the inner loop value to avoid conflicts with the outer `value` variable. This will prevent overwriting and ensure the correct generation of the `command` list.
