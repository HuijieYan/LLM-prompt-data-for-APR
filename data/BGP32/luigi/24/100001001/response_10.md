### Explanation of the bug:
The bug in the `_dict_arg` function lies in the fact that the variable name in the loop is being overwritten by the key variable in the loop iteration (`prop` in this case). This causes the values to be incorrect as the formatting is not consistent with the intended result.

### Strategy to fix the bug:
To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the variable names in the loop do not conflict with the variables used as input parameters. One possible solution is to rename the variable used in the loop to avoid this conflict.

### Corrected version of the function:
```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for key, val in value.items():
            command += [name, '"{0}={1}"'.format(key, val)]
    return command
```

By renaming the variables inside the loop to `key` and `val`, we prevent any conflicts with the input parameters of the function. This corrected version should now properly format the command list and deliver the expected output.
