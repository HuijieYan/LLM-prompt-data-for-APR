### Analysis:
The buggy function `_dict_arg` is supposed to convert a dictionary argument into a list of command line arguments. However, the bug lies in the way the function is constructing the command list inside the loop. The function is modifying the `value` variable within the loop, which causes it to incorrectly hold the last value from the dictionary, resulting in an incorrect command list.

### Bug Cause:
The bug occurs because the loop variable `value` is being used both as the loop variable and as the value from the dictionary. This causes the function to concatenate the incorrect values into the command list.

### Proposed Fix:
To fix the bug, we should use a different variable inside the loop to represent the value from the dictionary. This will prevent the reassignment of the `value` variable and ensure that the correct values are appended to the command list.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, '"{0}={1}"'.format(prop, val)]
    return command
```
