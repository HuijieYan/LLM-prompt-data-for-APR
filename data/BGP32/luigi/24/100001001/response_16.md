The bug in the `_dict_arg` function lies in the fact that it is reusing the variable name `value` both for the input dictionary and for the key-value pairs within the dictionary. This causes the function to incorrectly overwrite the original `value` dictionary and leads to incorrect results.

To fix this bug, we should use a different variable name for the key-value pairs within the dictionary. Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items(): # Change variable name from `value` to `val`
            command += [name, '"{0}={1}"'.format(prop, val)] # Use `val` instead of `value`
    return command
```

By making this change, we ensure that the original input `value` dictionary remains unchanged, and each key-value pair is correctly processed within the loop. This fix will prevent the function from overwriting the original dictionary and producing incorrect results.
