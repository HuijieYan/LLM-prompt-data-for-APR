The bug in the given function `_dict_arg` is due to reusing the variable name `value` in both the loop and as a parameter. This causes the loop iteration to overwrite the original `value` parameter, leading to incorrect results. 

To fix the bug, we need to use a different variable name in the loop to avoid overwriting the original `value` parameter. Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for key, val in value.items():  # Use different variable names to avoid overwriting
            command += [name, '"{0}={1}"'.format(key, val)]
    return command
```

By using `key` and `val` as loop variable names instead of `prop` and `value`, we prevent overwriting the original `value` parameter. This correction ensures that the function properly constructs the command list based on the input dictionary.
