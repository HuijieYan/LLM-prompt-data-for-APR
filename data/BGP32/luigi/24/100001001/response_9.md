### Explanation of the Bug

The bug in the `_dict_arg` function lies in the fact that the inner variable name `value` is being overwritten by the loop variable `value` when iterating through the dictionary items. This causes the loop to incorrectly append the key-value pair to the command list.

### Bug Fix Strategy

To fix this bug, we need to rename the loop variable from `value` to something else to avoid shadowing the outer variable name `value`. By doing this, we can ensure that the correct value is used for constructing the command list.

### Corrected Version of the Function

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():  # Renamed the loop variable from value to val
            command += [name, '"{0}={1}"'.format(prop, val)]
    return command
```

By renaming the loop variable to `val`, we prevent shadowing of the outer variable name `value`. This corrected version of the function should now correctly construct the command list based on the dictionary key-value pairs.
