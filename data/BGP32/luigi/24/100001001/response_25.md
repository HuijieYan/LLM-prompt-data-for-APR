The bug in the given function is that the variable name in the for loop is overshadowing the input parameter name, leading to incorrect values being appended to the command list.

To fix the bug, we should use a different variable name in the for loop to avoid conflicts with the input parameters.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for key, val in value.items():
            command += [name, '"{0}={1}"'.format(key, val)]
    return command
```

By changing the variable name in the for loop from `prop` to `key` and from `value` to `val`, we prevent any conflicts with the input parameters and ensure that the correct values are appended to the command list.

This correction should resolve the bug and produce the expected output for the provided test cases.
