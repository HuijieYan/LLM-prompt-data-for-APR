The issue in the buggy function lies in how the key-value pairs are being formatted and added to the `command` list. The function is adding the key-value pairs as strings enclosed in double quotes, which is causing the test cases to fail due to the mismatch in the expected and actual outputs.

To fix this issue, we need to modify the way key-value pairs are added to the `command` list, removing the unnecessary double quotes around the values.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, '{0}={1}'.format(prop, val)]
    return command
```

By making this change, the function will correctly format the key-value pairs without unnecessary double quotes, resolving the mismatch in the expected and actual outputs in the failing test cases.
