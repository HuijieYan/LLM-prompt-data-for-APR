### Analysis
The bug in the `_dict_arg` function stems from the way key-value pairs are being processed within the loop. The current implementation adds quotes around both the property and value for each key-value pair, leading to the test failures as the expected output does not have quotes around the property values.

### Bug Cause
1. The function adds double quotes around each property-value pair.
2. The test cases are expecting the property values without double quotes.
3. This discrepancy leads to the assertion errors in the test cases.

### Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to remove the double quotes from the property value before adding them to the command list.

### Corrected Version
```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, '{0}={1}'.format(prop, val)]
    return command
```

By making this change, the function will correctly format the key-value pairs without adding unnecessary double quotes, aligning with the expected output in the test cases.
