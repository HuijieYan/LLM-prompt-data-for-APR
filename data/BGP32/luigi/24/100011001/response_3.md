### Bug Analysis:
The bug in the `_dict_arg` function lies in the way it handles the values of the dictionary passed to it. The function incorrectly adds quotes around the values while constructing the command list. This leads to a mismatch with the expected command list, causing the test failures.

### Bug Explanation:
1. In Case 1, the input dictionary has a key `Prop` with value `Value`. The function erroneously adds double quotes around the value resulting in `'"Prop=Value"'`. This causes a mismatch with the expected value without quotes `Prop=Value`.

2. In Case 2, the input dictionary has a key `prop1` with value `val1`. Similar to Case 1, the function adds double quotes around the value resulting in `'"prop1=val1"'`. Again, this leads to a mismatch with the expected value without quotes `prop1=val1`.

### Bug Fix:
To fix the bug, we should modify the `_dict_arg` function to construct the command list without adding quotes around the dictionary values.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, '{0}={1}'.format(prop, val)]
    return command
```

By making this change, the function will correctly construct the command list without adding quotes around the dictionary values, resolving the test failures.
