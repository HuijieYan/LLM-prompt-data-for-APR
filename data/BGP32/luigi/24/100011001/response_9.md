### Bug Analysis
The bug is related to how the function is handling dictionary values when constructing the `command` list. The function is adding quotation marks around the values of the dictionary items. This is incorrect because the values in the command list should not be enclosed in quotation marks.

### Bug Cause
The function incorrectly adds quotation marks around the values of the dictionary items, causing the constructed command list items to be enclosed in quotes.

### Bug Fix
To fix the bug, we need to remove the quotation marks around the values of the dictionary items in the `command` list.

### Corrected Version of the Function
```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, prop_value in value.items():
            command += [name, '{0}={1}'.format(prop, prop_value)]
    return command
```

After applying this fix, the function should construct the `command` list without enclosing the values in quotation marks, which will match the expected output in the failing test cases.
