### Explanation
The bug in the `_dict_arg` function is that it is incorrectly adding double quotes around the property value pairs when creating the command list. This results in a mismatch with the expected command list from the test cases, causing the assertions to fail.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug
To fix the bug, we need to remove the unnecessary double quotes added around the property value pairs in the command list created by the function.

### Corrected Version of the Function
```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, "{0}={1}".format(prop, val)]
    return command
```

By removing the double quotes around `{0}={1}` in the format string, we ensure that the property value pairs are correctly formatted when creating the command list.
