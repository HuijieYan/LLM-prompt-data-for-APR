### Analysis
The buggy function `_dict_arg` is intended to take a dictionary `value` and convert it into a list `command` where each key-value pair is represented as a string element in the list. However, the bug lies in the way the key-value pairs are being formatted. The current implementation incorrectly adds double quotes around the values.

The error messages indicate that the expected output lists do not match the actual output lists due to the string formatting issue in the buggy function. The double quotes around the values are causing the lists to differ.

### Bug Cause
The bug is caused by adding unnecessary double quotes around the values in the `command` list. The test cases expect the values without double quotes, but the function is adding double quotes during the string formatting.

### Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to remove the unnecessary double quotes around the values when constructing the `command` list. This can be achieved by simply formatting the key and value without additional quotes.

### Corrected Version
```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, '{0}={1}'.format(prop, val)]
    return command
``` 

After implementing this corrected version, the function should now correctly generate the list without unnecessary double quotes around the values, resolving the failing test cases.
