### Bug Explanation
The bug in the `_dict_arg` function arises from the way the values are being handled when constructing the `command` list. The function is incorrectly converting the dictionary values to strings with additional quotes, causing a mismatch while comparing the expected command list in the test cases.

In both cases provided, the issue specifically appears when converting the dictionary values to strings. Instead of simply using the value itself, the function is adding extra double-quotes around it, making it incompatible with the expected command list.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix this bug, we need to remove the unnecessary double-quotes when constructing the command list for dictionary entries. By doing this, we can ensure that the generated command list matches the expected format.

### Corrected Version

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, '{0}={1}'.format(prop, val)]
    return command
``` 

This corrected version of the `_dict_arg` function should resolve the issue and pass the failing tests provided.
