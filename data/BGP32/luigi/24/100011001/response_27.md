### Bug Analysis
- The bug occurs because the function `_dict_arg` incorrectly encloses the property value within double quotes when constructing the command list.
- This leads to a mismatch between the expected command list in the test cases and the actual command list generated by the function.
- The double quotes around the property value cause the test assertions to fail as they expect a different format.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to remove the double quotes around the property value when constructing the command list. This will ensure that the command list matches the expected format in the test cases.

### Corrected Version of the Function
```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, '{0}={1}'.format(prop, val)]
    return command
```

By removing the double quotes in the format string, the corrected version of the function will correctly construct the command list without enclosing the property value in quotes. This change will ensure that the function generates the expected command list format, fixing the bug.
