### Bug Analysis
The bug in the `_dict_arg` function arises from the way the function handles the creation of command arguments. The function is currently adding quotes around the property value pairs when generating the command list, resulting in an inconsistency with the expected command structure.

The inconsistency is causing the test failures as the expected command list does not match the actual command list due to the presence of unnecessary quotation marks around the property values.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to modify the `_dict_arg` function to correctly generate the command list without adding the unnecessary quotes around the property values. We should ensure that the property values are concatenated directly without any additional formatting.

### Corrected Version of the Function
```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, '{0}={1}'.format(prop, val)]
    return command
``` 

### Updated Explanation
The corrected version of the function now correctly generates the command list by directly concatenating the property values without adding unnecessary quotes. This change ensures that the command list matches the expected structure and eliminates the inconsistency that was causing the test failures.
