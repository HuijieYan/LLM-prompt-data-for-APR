### Analysis
The bug in the `_dict_arg` function is related to how the function formats the dictionary items into strings to be added to the `command` list. The current implementation is wrapping the property values in double quotes, leading to a mismatch when comparing the expected list of arguments in the test cases.

### Bug Cause
The bug is caused by adding double quotes around the property values when constructing the command list. This leads to a mismatch when comparing the expected list in the test cases, which do not include the double quotes.

### Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to remove the double quotes around the property values while constructing the command list inside the `_dict_arg` function. This will ensure that the command list matches the expected list in the test cases.

### Corrected Version
```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, '{0}={1}'.format(prop, val)]
    return command
``` 

By removing the unnecessary double quotes around the property values in the `'{0}={1}'.format(prop, val)` expression, the corrected version of the function should now properly construct the command list without the extra quotes. This change should address the mismatch in the test cases and resolve the bug.
