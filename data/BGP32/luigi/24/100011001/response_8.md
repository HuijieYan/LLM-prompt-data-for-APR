### Bug Explanation:

The bug in the `_dict_arg` function stems from the way the values from the dictionary are being formatted and added to the `command` list. The current code wraps the dictionary values in double quotes, causing discrepancies when compared with the expected output in the test cases. The expected output does not contain the dictionary values surrounded by double quotes.

### Bug Fix:

To fix the bug, we need to remove the double quotes around the dictionary values before adding them to the `command` list. This will ensure that the formatting matches the expected output in the test cases.

### Corrected Function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, '{0}={1}'.format(prop, val)]
    return command
``` 

By making this change, the function should now correctly format the dictionary values without the extra double quotes, resolving the discrepancies in the test cases and passing the failing tests.
