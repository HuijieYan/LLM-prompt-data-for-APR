### Bug Explanation
The bug in the `_dict_arg` function arises from the incorrect handling of the dictionary values when constructing the `command` list. The function incorrectly wraps the property values in double quotes, causing a mismatch with the expected format in the test cases.

In Case 1, the function is adding quotes around the property value `"Value"` instead of `Value`, leading to a mismatch when compared in the test.

In Case 2, the function is adding quotes around the property value `"val1"` instead of `val1`, causing a mismatch when compared in the test.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to update the `_dict_arg` function to correctly format the property values without wrapping them in double quotes. This will ensure that the `command` list matches the expected format when compared in the test cases.

### Corrected Version of the Function
```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, '{0}={1}'.format(prop, val)]
    return command
```

By removing the quotes around the property values in the `format` method, we ensure that the property values are formatted correctly in the `command` list without any additional characters. This corrected version should fix the bug and make the function behave as expected in the given test cases.
