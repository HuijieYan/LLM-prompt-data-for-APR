### Bug Explanation:
The bug in the `_dict_arg` function arises from the incorrect handling of dictionary values when constructing the `command` list. The function is currently wrapping dictionary values in double-quotes, causing a mismatch between the expected and actual values when comparing lists in the test cases. This discrepancy is leading to the AssertionErrors observed in the failing tests.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to modify the function `_dict_arg` to correctly construct the `command` list without wrapping dictionary values in double-quotes unnecessarily. By making this adjustment, the function will align with the expected output values in the test cases and resolve the AssertionErrors.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, '{0}={1}'.format(prop, val)]
    return command
```

Applying this correction will ensure that the dictionary values are added to the `command` list without unnecessary double-quotes, enabling the function to produce the expected output values for the test cases.
