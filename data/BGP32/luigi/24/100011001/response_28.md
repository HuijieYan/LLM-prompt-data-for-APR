### Bug Analysis
The bug in the provided function `_dict_arg` lies in how the function constructs the command list. Specifically, when adding a key-value pair from the dictionary `value` to the `command` list, the function erroneously wraps the value in double quotes even though the value is already a string in some cases. This behavior results in an incorrect format for some elements in the `command` list.

### Bug Explanation
1. In Case 1, the original function adds the key-value pair `'Prop=Value'` to the `command` list as `'"Prop=Value"'`. This format includes the value (`'Value'`) within additional double quotes, leading to an extra level of quoting in the final command list. This causes the assertion error in the test case.
   
2. In Case 2, a similar issue arises where the key-value pair `'prop1=val1'` is added to the `command` list as `'"prop1=val1"'`, resulting in extra double quotes around the value portion. This discrepancy leads to another assertion error in a separate test case.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, the function `_dict_arg` should be modified to conditionally add double quotes around the value only if the value is a string. This will ensure that strings are not unnecessarily quoted, resolving the issue with extra quoting in the command list.

### Corrected Version of the Function
```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            if isinstance(val, str):
                command += [name, '{0}={1}'.format(prop, val)]
            else:
                command += [name, '{0}="{1}"'.format(prop, val)]
    return command
```

By making this adjustment, the corrected version of the function will correctly handle the key-value pairs from the input dictionary, avoiding unnecessary quoting of string values and ensuring the command list is formatted appropriately for the tests to pass.
