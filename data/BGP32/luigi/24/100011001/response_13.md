### Bug Explanation
The bug in the `_dict_arg` function arises from the incorrect handling of dictionary values when constructing the `command` list. The issue lies in how the function creates the command list by including double quotes around the values from the dictionary.

When the function encounters a dictionary value like `{'Prop': 'Value'}`, it incorrectly adds the value with double quotes as `'"Prop=Value"'` instead of just `'Prop=Value'`. This inconsistency causes the assertion errors in the test cases.

### Bug Fix
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that when constructing the `command` list, the function correctly formats the dictionary values without unnecessary double quotes.

### Corrected Function
```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, f"{prop}={val}"]
    return command
``` 

By using f-strings (formatted string literals) in Python, we can easily concatenate the properties and values without manually including double quotes. This corrected version of the function should resolve the bug and pass the failing tests.
