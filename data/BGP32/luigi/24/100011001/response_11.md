The bug in the `_dict_arg` function lies in the way the dictionary key-value pairs are handled. The function currently wraps both the property and value in double quotes when creating the command list, resulting in a mismatch with the expected format in the test cases.

To fix this bug, we need to remove the unnecessary double quotes around the property-value pair in the command list.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, '{0}={1}'.format(prop, val)]
    return command
```

This corrected version removes the double quotes around the property-value pair, matching the expected format in the failing test cases.
