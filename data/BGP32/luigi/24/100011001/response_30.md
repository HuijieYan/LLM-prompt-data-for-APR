### Bug Explanation
The bug in the `_dict_arg` function lies in the way the function is handling dictionary values. The function is incorrectly adding quotation marks around the property value pairs when constructing the command list. This results in the assertion errors seen in the failing tests, where the expected command list does not match the actual command list due to the presence of unnecessary quotation marks.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix this bug, we need to update the `_dict_arg` function to construct the command list without adding unnecessary quotation marks around the property value pairs. This can be achieved by removing the quotation marks from the `value` part when formatting the string.

### Corrected Version of the Function
```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, '{0}={1}'.format(prop, val)]
    return command
```

By applying this correction, the function will construct the command list correctly without unnecessary quotation marks. This fix should resolve the assertion errors in the failing tests.
