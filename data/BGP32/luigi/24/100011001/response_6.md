### Bug Explanation
The bug in the `_dict_arg` function is related to how it handles dict values. When converting the dictionary values to a command list, the function incorrectly encloses the property and value in double quotes, causing a mismatch with the expected output in the tests.

In Case 1, the function incorrectly adds double quotes around the value `"Value"` resulting in `'"Value"'` instead of just `Value`.

In Case 2, the function incorrectly adds double quotes around the value `"val1"` resulting in `'"val1"'` instead of just `val1`.

This incorrect formatting of values is the cause of the assertion errors seen in the failing tests.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, remove the unnecessary double quotes around the property values when constructing the command list.

### Corrected Version of the Function
```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, '{0}={1}'.format(prop, val)]
    return command
``` 

By making this change, the function will correctly format the property-value pairs without unnecessary double quotes, resolving the bug and passing the failing tests.
