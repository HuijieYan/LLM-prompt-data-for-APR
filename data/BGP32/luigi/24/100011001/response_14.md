### Bug Analysis
The bug in the provided function `_dict_arg` is caused by the incorrect formatting of dictionary values when generating the command list. The function is converting dictionary key-value pairs into strings and adding double quotes around the values, which is causing a mismatch with the expected command list in the test cases. The error messages indicate that the values are being formatted incorrectly as strings enclosed in double quotes, while they should be inserted as plain values without quotes.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to modify the function `_dict_arg` to correctly format dictionary key-value pairs without enclosing the values in double quotes. We can simply concatenate the key and value without any quotes to generate the command list.

### Corrected Version of the Function
```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, "{0}={1}".format(prop, val)]
    return command
```

By making this correction, the function will correctly format the dictionary key-value pairs to match the expected command list structure, resolving the failing test cases.
