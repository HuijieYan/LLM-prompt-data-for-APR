### Bug Analysis
The buggy function `_dict_arg` is intended to convert a dictionary into a list of command-line arguments. The bug arises from the fact that the function is incorrectly formatting dictionary values as strings within double quotes (`" "`), which causes a mismatch with the expected non-double quoted values.

### Bug Explanation
1. In Case 1, the function incorrectly converts the dictionary `{ 'Prop': 'Value' }` into a list `['--conf', '"Prop=Value"']` where the `Value` is enclosed in double quotes `" "`. This mismatch causes the failing assertion in the test.
   
2. In Case 2, a similar issue happens with the dictionary `{ 'prop1': 'val1' }`. The function converts it into a list `['--conf', '"prop1=val1"']` where the `val1` value is enclosed in double quotes.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we should remove the unnecessary double quotes (`"`) around the dictionary values in the command list.

### Corrected Version of the Function
```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():  # Change variable name to val to avoid overwriting
            command += [name, '{0}={1}'.format(prop, val)]  # Remove unnecessary double quotes
    return command
```

### Correction Rationale
By modifying the value concatenation to `{0}={1}` without wrapping the values in double quotes, we ensure that the resulting command list matches the expected format without the extra quotes causing discrepancies.
