The bug in the `_dict_arg` function is caused by the incorrect formatting of the dictionary items when generating the command list. The function currently adds extra double quotes around the property-value pair, causing discrepancies when comparing the expected command list with the actual one.

To fix this bug, we need to remove the extra double quotes added around the property-value pair in the command list. We can simply concatenate the strings without adding additional quotes.

Here is the corrected version of the `_dict_arg` function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, '{0}={1}'.format(prop, val)] # Removed extra quotes around prop and val
    return command
```

With this correction, the function should now correctly generate the command list without extra double quotes around the property-value pairs. This fix should resolve the failing tests and make the function behave as expected.
