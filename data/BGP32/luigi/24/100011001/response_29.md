### Buggy Function Explanation
The buggy function `_dict_arg` is supposed to format a dictionary into a list of command arguments for further processing. However, the bug lies in how the function is handling the values when constructing the command list. It incorrectly formats the dictionary key-value pairs into a list of strings, where the values are enclosed in double quotes. This incorrect formatting causes the assertion errors in the failing tests.

### Bug Location
The bug is located in the line where the function constructs the command list `command += [name, '"{0}={1}"'.format(prop, value)]`. Here, the function incorrectly adds the key and value inside double quotes, which causes issues when comparing the generated command list with the expected output.

### Bug Cause
The bug causes the generated command list to contain values enclosed in double quotes, while the expected output does not have the values enclosed in quotes. This discrepancy leads to assertion errors during the test comparisons.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, the function should correctly format the key-value pairs from the dictionary without enclosing the values in double quotes. This way, the generated command list will match the expected output in the tests.

### Corrected Version of the Function
```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, "{0}={1}".format(prop, val)]
    return command
```

By correcting the function as shown above, the values from the dictionary will be formatted correctly without the unnecessary double quotes. This change should resolve the assertion errors in the failing tests and ensure the function works as intended.
