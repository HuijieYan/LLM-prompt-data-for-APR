### Bug Analysis:
The bug arises from the way the function is constructing the command list. Currently, it adds double quotes around the property value when creating the command list for each key-value pair in the dictionary. This is causing a mismatch between the expected command list and the actual command list, leading to assertion errors in the tests.

### Bug Explanation:
1. In Case 1, when the input dictionary is `{'Prop': 'Value'}`, the buggy function constructs the command list as `['--conf', '"Prop=Value"']`, with double quotes around the property value.
2. In Case 2, when the input dictionary is `{'prop1': 'val1'}`, the buggy function constructs the command list as `['--conf', '"prop1=val1"']`, again with double quotes around the property value.

### Bug Fix:
To fix the bug, we need to remove the unnecessary double quotes when adding key-value pairs to the command list. The corrected version of the function should directly append the key and value without any extra formatting.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():  # Rename the 'value' variable to 'val' to avoid conflict
            command += [name, prop + '=' + val]  # Append key-value pairs without quotes
    return command
``` 

By making this change, the function will construct the command list correctly, leading to the passing of the failing tests.
