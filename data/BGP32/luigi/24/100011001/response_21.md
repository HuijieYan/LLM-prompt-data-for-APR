The bug in the `_dict_arg` function is caused by the incorrect formatting of the dictionary values when constructing the `command` list. The function adds double quotes around the property and value pair, which is not required. This extra quoting leads to a mismatch in the expected and actual values in the failing tests.

To fix the bug, we need to remove the unnecessary double quotes from around the property and value pair in the `command` list.

Here is the corrected version of the `_dict_arg` function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():  # Changed variable name to val to avoid conflict with outer value
            command += [name, '{0}={1}'.format(prop, val)]  # Removed unnecessary double quotes
    return command
```

By making this change, the function is now corrected to properly format the property and value pairs from the dictionary without introducing unnecessary quotes. This modification ensures that the function will pass the failing tests.
