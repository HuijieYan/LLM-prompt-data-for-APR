### Bug Analysis
In both cases provided, the issue stems from the buggy function `_dict_arg`. The function is intended to construct a command list based on the input dictionary `value`. However, the bug arises when forming the command list elements for key-value pairs in the dictionary.

The function incorrectly wraps the value of each key-value pair in double quotes, resulting in a mismatch when comparing the constructed command list to the expected list. The discrepancy is due to the presence of double quotes around the values in the constructed list, which should not be there.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To resolve the bug, the function `_dict_arg` should not add double quotes around the values of key-value pairs in the command list. Instead, it should directly append the key and value without any additional formatting.

### Corrected Version
```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, '{0}={1}'.format(prop, val)]
    return command
```

By updating the function to this corrected version, the command list will be constructed without double quotes around the values of the key-value pairs, resolving the discrepancies observed in the failing tests.
