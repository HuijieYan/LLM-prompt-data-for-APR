### Bug Explanation
The buggy function `_dict_arg` is intended to construct a list of command line arguments by iterating through a dictionary and appending key-value pairs in a specific format. However, the bug arises due to the fact that when constructing the command list, the value is mistakenly enclosed in double quotes in the format `"{prop}={value}"`. This results in the value being treated as a single string with quotes, causing differences in the expected and actual command list elements during the test assertions.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to remove the unnecessary double quotes around the value when constructing the command list. This should ensure that the command elements match the expected format without extra characters.

### Corrected Version of the Function
```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, '{0}={1}'.format(prop, val)]
    return command
```

By using the corrected version of the `_dict_arg` function provided above, the unnecessary double quotes around the value will be removed, and the resulting command list should match the expected format, passing the failing tests.
