The bug in the `_dict_arg` function arises from the use of quotation marks around the property value when constructing the command list. This leads to a mismatch in the expected and actual values in the test cases.

The strategy to fix the bug is to remove the unnecessary quotation marks around the property value in the command list construction.

Here is the corrected version of the function:
```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, '{0}={1}'.format(prop, val)]
    return command
```

This corrected version should address the issue and pass the failing tests.
