### Analysis
1. The buggy function `_dict_arg` is supposed to take a dictionary as input, iterate through its key-value pairs, and construct a list of command arguments based on the key-value pairs.
2. The function is currently adding the value of each key-value pair enclosed in double quotes, which is causing the assertion errors in the test cases.
3. The cause of the bug is that the function is adding unnecessary double quotes around the value of each key-value pair.
4. To fix the bug, we should remove the unnecessary double quotes around the value when constructing the command list.

### Proposed Fix
```python
class SparkSubmitTask(luigi.Task):

    def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
        command = []
        if value and isinstance(value, dict):
            for prop, val in value.items(): # changed the variable name from "value" to "val"
                command += [name, '{0}={1}'.format(prop, val)] # removed unnecessary double quotes
        return command
```

By making the above change, the function will correctly construct the command list without unnecessary double quotes around the values. This should fix the bug and make the function pass the failing test cases.
