### Fixing the bug

The bug in the function `_dict_arg` is due to the incorrect formatting of the dictionary key-value pair when constructing the command list. The function is wrapping the value with double quotes unnecessarily, leading to a mismatch with the expected format.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the line where the `name` and `value` are concatenated to form the command list. In this case, since we are dealing with key-value pairs within a dictionary, we only need to concatenate the `name` and the formatted `prop=value` string without any additional quotes.

### Corrected Version

```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: luigi/contrib/spark.py

# The declaration of the class containing the buggy function
class SparkSubmitTask(luigi.Task):
    """

    # Corrected version of the buggy function
    def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
        command = []
        if value and isinstance(value, dict):
            for prop, value in value.items():
                command += [name, '{0}={1}'.format(prop, value)]
        return command
