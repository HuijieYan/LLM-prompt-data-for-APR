### Analysis:
1. The `_dict_arg` function takes in a `name` and `value` as parameters. It is supposed to construct a command list based on the `value` dictionary provided.
2. The bug seems to be related to how the function handles constructing the command list for dictionary values.
3. The error messages indicate that the function is adding unnecessary double quotes around values in the command list causing a mismatch between the expected and actual output.
4. To fix the bug, we should remove the double quotes around the values when constructing the command list.

### Bug Fix:
To fix the bug, we need to adjust how the values are appended to the command list in the `_dict_arg` function. We should remove the double quotes from around the values before adding them to the command list.

```python
class SparkSubmitTask(luigi.Task):
    def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
        command = []
        if value and isinstance(value, dict):
            for prop, val in value.items():
                command += [name, "{0}={1}".format(prop, val)]
        return command
```

By removing the unnecessary double quotes when constructing the command list, we should be able to pass the failing tests and meet the expected input/output values.
