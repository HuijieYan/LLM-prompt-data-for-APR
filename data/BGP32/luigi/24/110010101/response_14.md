### Analysis
1. The buggy function `_dict_arg` takes a `name` and a `value` as inputs. It is expected to construct a list `command` where each element is formatted as `'{name}="{prop}={value}"'` based on the key-value pairs in the input dictionary `value`.
2. The error messages indicate that the formatting of the key-value pairs is incorrect. The actual output includes unnecessary double quotes around the value.
3. The bug seems to stem from how the key-value pairs are being formatted within the loop in the function, resulting in extra quotes around the values.
4. To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the formatting of key-value pairs does not include unnecessary quotes.
5. Below is the corrected version of the function.

### Corrected Version
```python
class SparkSubmitTask(luigi.Task):
    def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
        command = []
        if value and isinstance(value, dict):
            for prop, val in value.items():
                command += [name, "{0}={1}".format(prop, val)]
        return command
```

By using `{0}={1}` in the format string, the corrected function avoids including unnecessary double quotes around the values. This change should ensure that the key-value pairs are formatted correctly in the final list `command`.
