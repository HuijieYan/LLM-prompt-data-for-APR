### Analysis:
1. The `_dict_arg` function is designed to take in a dictionary `value` and process it to create a list `command` containing key-value pairs formatted with the `name` argument. 
2. The buggy function is not handling the formatting of the key-value pairs correctly, resulting in discrepancies in the output compared to the expected values.
3. The error messages indicate that the formatting of the key-value pairs is causing the failure in the tests.
4. The bug seems to be related to the incorrect handling of quotes in the key-value pairs. The function is wrapping values in double quotes unnecessarily, leading to a mismatch with the expected values.
5. To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the values in the key-value pairs are not wrapped in double quotes when forming the command list.

### Proposed Fix:
- Update the `_dict_arg` function to correctly format the key-value pairs without unnecessary double quotes.

```python
import luigi

class SparkSubmitTask(luigi.Task):
    """
    Template task for running a Spark job
    
    Supports running jobs on Spark local, standalone, Mesos or Yarn
    
    See http://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/submitting-applications.html
    for more information
    """

    def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
        command = []
        if value and isinstance(value, dict):
            for prop, val in value.items():
                command += [name, '{0}={1}'.format(prop, val)]
        return command
```

With this correction, the function should now correctly format the key-value pairs without unnecessary quotes, resolving the discrepancies in the test outputs.
