### Analysis
1. The buggy function `_dict_arg` is supposed to process a dictionary input `value` and generate a list of command-line arguments based on the key-value pairs in the dictionary.
2. The buggy function is incorrectly adding quotes around the values when generating the command list.
3. The error messages indicate that the comparison is failing due to the presence of quotes in the generated command list.
4. To fix the bug, we need to remove the unnecessary quotes around the values while constructing the command list.

### Bug Fix Strategy
1. Check if the value is a dictionary and iterate through its items.
2. For each key-value pair, construct the argument by appending the name, key, and value without quotes to the command list.
3. Return the final command list.

### Corrected Version of the Function

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, '{0}={1}'.format(prop, val)]
    return command
``` 

By using the `.format()` method without enclosing the value in quotes, we fix the bug in the function. The corrected version should now pass the failing tests and return the expected command lists without unnecessary quotes.
