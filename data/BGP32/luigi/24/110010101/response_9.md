### Analysis
1. The buggy function `_dict_arg` is designed to take in a key-value pair in the form of a dictionary and construct a list representing command-line arguments for submission to Spark.
2. The issue lies in how the function is handling the key-value pair. It is mistakenly enclosing the value in double quotes leading to a mismatch with the expected output.
3. The bug is caused by the unnecessary inclusion of double quotes around the property values when constructing the command list. This results in an incorrect comparison with the expected output during the test cases.
4. To fix the bug, we need to remove the unnecessary double quotes in the construction of the command list inside the loop iterating over the key-value pairs in the input dictionary.
5. Below is the corrected version of the `_dict_arg` function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, '{0}={1}'.format(prop, val)]
    return command
```

By removing the double quotes around `{1}`, we ensure that the command list is constructed correctly without any unnecessary characters, resolving the bug.
