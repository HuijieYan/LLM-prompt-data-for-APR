### Analysis
1. The buggy function `_dict_arg` takes in a `name` and `value` as parameters and constructs a command based on the provided key-value pairs in the `value` dictionary.
2. The function iterates over the key-value pairs in the dictionary and adds them to the `command` list.
3. The error arises because when constructing the command, the value is being enclosed in double quotes, resulting in a mismatch with the expected output.
4. The bug can be fixed by removing the unnecessary double quotes around the value while constructing the command.

### Bug Fix Strategy
- Update the logic where the value is added to the command list to remove the unnecessary double quotes around the value.

### Corrected Version of the Function
```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: luigi/contrib/spark.py

# The declaration of the class containing the buggy function
class SparkSubmitTask(luigi.Task):
    """
    Template task for running a Spark job
    
    Supports running jobs on Spark local, standalone, Mesos or Yarn
    
    See http://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/submitting-applications.html
    for more information
    """

    # Corrected version of the buggy function
    def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
        command = []
        if value and isinstance(value, dict):
            for prop, prop_value in value.items():
                command += [name, '{0}={1}'.format(prop, prop_value)]
        return command
```

By updating the function to remove the unnecessary double quotes around the value when constructing the command, the corrected version should now pass the failing test cases and produce the expected output.
