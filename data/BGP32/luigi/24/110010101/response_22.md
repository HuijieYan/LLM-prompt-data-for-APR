### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_dict_arg` is supposed to construct a list of command arguments based on a given dictionary of properties and values.
2. The function iterates over the input dictionary, extracts the key-value pairs, and formats them in the form of `{key}={value}`.
3. The bug seems to be related to how the property-value pairs are added to the `command` list. The function is incorrectly enclosing the property-value pair in double quotes when adding it to the list.
4. To fix the bug, we need to remove the unnecessary double quoting when constructing the command list.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Modify the code in the loop inside the function `_dict_arg` to append property-value pairs to the `command` list without enclosing them in double quotes.
2. Ensure that the correct format `{prop}={value}` is used to maintain consistency with the expected output.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, '{0}={1}'.format(prop, val)]
    return command
```

By making these changes, the function should correctly construct the list of command arguments as expected, resolving the bug in the original implementation.
