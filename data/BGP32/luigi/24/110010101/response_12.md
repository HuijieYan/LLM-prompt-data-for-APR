### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_dict_arg` takes a `name` (string) and a `value` (dictionary) as input.
2. It checks if the `value` is a dictionary and if it is not empty, iterates over its items to construct a list `command` with the key as part of `name` and the value as part of the command string.
3. The issue arises with how the key-value pairs are being added to the `command` list. It is incorrectly formatting them as `"{key}={value}"` with double quotes around the value.
4. This formatting issue leads to differences in the list comparison during the test cases, causing the tests to fail.
5. To fix this bug, we need to remove the unnecessary double quotes around the value when constructing the command list.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Modify the way key-value pairs are added to the `command` list by directly appending `name`, key, '=', and value without any extra quotes.
2. Ensure that the constructed `command` list remains consistent with the expected list in the test cases.
3. Update the function `_dict_arg` to align with the corrected behavior.

### Corrected Version:
```python
class SparkSubmitTask(luigi.Task):
    def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
        command = []
        if value and isinstance(value, dict):
            for prop, value in value.items():
                # Append key and value directly without quotes
                command += [name, '{0}={1}'.format(prop, value)]
        return command
```
