### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_dict_arg` is supposed to convert a dictionary into a list of strings in a specific format.
2. The bug seems to be related to the formatting of the dictionary key-value pairs.
3. The bug is caused by the function formatting the dictionary values with extra quotes `" "` which is not expected by the test cases.
4. To fix the bug, we need to remove the extra quotes around the property values when constructing the command list.

### Correction:

```python
import luigi

class SparkSubmitTask(luigi.Task):
    """
    Template task for running a Spark job
    
    Supports running jobs on Spark local, standalone, Mesos or Yarn
    
    See http://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/submitting-applications.html
    for more information
    """

    def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
        command = []
        if value and isinstance(value, dict):
            for prop, val in value.items():
                command += [name, '{0}={1}'.format(prop, val)]
        return command
```

By removing the extra quotes around the property values in the command list, the corrected version of the `_dict_arg` function should now correctly format the dictionary key-value pairs in the expected format.
