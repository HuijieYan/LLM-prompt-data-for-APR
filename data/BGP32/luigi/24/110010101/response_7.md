### Analysis
1. The function `_dict_arg` is intended to convert a dictionary value into a list of command arguments in the format `name=value`.
2. The bug seems to be related to how the function formats the dictionary values into strings.
3. The error messages indicate that the bug lies in how the function handles the dictionary values during formatting.
4. To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the dictionary key-value pairs are correctly formatted without any extra quotes.

### Bug Cause
The bug is caused by adding unnecessary double quotes around the values in the command list. This results in a mismatch with the expected values during the test cases.

### Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to remove the extra quotes around the dictionary values while formatting them into strings.
