### Analyzing the Buggy Function

1. The function `_dict_arg` is designed to convert a dictionary into a list of command arguments.
2. The function checks if the input `value` is a dictionary, and if so, iterates over its items to construct a list of commands.
3. The constructed commands are in the format `'name=value'`.

### Identifying Potential Error Locations

1. The issue seems to be in the formatting of the commands. The expected format is `'name=value'`, but the current implementation wraps the `value` in double quotes unnecessarily.
2. This unnecessary formatting leads to the discrepancy between the expected value and the actual value.

### Explaining the Cause of the Bug

1. The bug occurs because the current implementation adds unnecessary double quotes around the `value` in the command list.
2. The testing code expects the value to be without quotes, causing the assertion error.

### Suggesting a Strategy for Fixing the Bug

1. To fix the bug, the unnecessary double quotes around the `value` in the command list need to be removed.
2. The function should construct the command list without wrapping the `value` in quotes.

### Corrected Version of the Function

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, '{0}={1}'.format(prop, val)]  # Remove unnecessary quotes here
    return command
```

By removing the unnecessary double quotes when constructing the command list, the corrected version of the function should now generate the correct command list without the extra quotes.
