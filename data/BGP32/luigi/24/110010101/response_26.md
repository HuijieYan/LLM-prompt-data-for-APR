### Analysis
1. The buggy function `_dict_arg` takes in a `name` and a `value` parameter. It is expected to iterate over the key-value pairs in the `value` dictionary and construct a list of arguments for a command, where each argument consists of the `name` followed by the key-value pair formatted as a string.
2. The error messages indicate that there is an issue with how the key-value pairs are formatted in the command list.
3. The bug stems from the fact that the buggy function incorrectly wraps the values from the dictionary in double quotes, which causes a mismatch with the expected values when constructing the command list.
4. To fix the bug, we need to remove the unnecessary double quotes around the formatted key-value pairs in the command list.

### Bug Fix
Here is the corrected version of the `_dict_arg` function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, '{0}={1}'.format(prop, val)]
    return command
```

By removing the unnecessary double quotes around the formatted key-value pairs, the function should now correctly construct the command list for the Spark job arguments.
