### Analysis:
1. The provided function `_dict_arg` is supposed to construct command arguments from a dictionary input. The function iterates over the key-value pairs in the dictionary and appends them to the `command` list in a specific format.
2. The bug seems to be related to how the function handles the key-value pairs - it currently wraps the values in double quotes which is causing a mismatch in the test cases where the quotes are not expected.
3. The error messages indicate that the function is adding double quotes around the property values, causing the test comparisons to fail.
4. To fix the bug, we need to adjust the way the function constructs the command list by not including the double quotes around the values.
5. We can modify the function to construct the command list without the unnecessary double quotes.

### Bug Fix:
```python
class SparkSubmitTask(luigi.Task):
    def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
        command = []
        if value and isinstance(value, dict):
            for prop, val in value.items():
                command += [name, "{0}={1}".format(prop, val)]  # Fix: Construct command without quotes
        return command
```

By updating the function to construct the command without the double quotes, the bug should be fixed and the corrected version of the function should now pass the failing test cases.
