### Analysis:
1. The `SparkSubmitTask` class has a method `_dict_arg` that is supposed to convert a dictionary into a list of command line arguments.
2. The bug seems to be related to how the function handles key-value pairs in the dictionary. It currently wraps the value in double quotes, which is causing the test cases to fail.
3. The failing test cases show that the expected output does not include the values in double quotes, which indicates that the function is not handling the dictionary values correctly.
4. To fix the bug, we need to update the `_dict_arg` function to handle dictionary values without wrapping them in double quotes.

### Bug Fix:
```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, '{0}={1}'.format(prop, val)]
    return command
```

### Updated function:
The updated function removes the unnecessary double quotes around the dictionary values when creating the command list. This change should now correctly generate the command list with key-value pairs without quotes.

By making this change, the function should now pass the failing test cases and correctly convert dictionaries into command line arguments.
