### Analysis
The buggy function `_dict_arg` is supposed to take a dictionary as input, iterate over its key-value pairs, and construct a list of command line arguments based on the keys and values. However, there is a bug in the function where it is wrapping the property values in double quotes, leading to a mismatch in the expected and actual command list generated.

### Bug Explanation
The bug in the `_dict_arg` function occurs when constructing the command list with property values enclosed in double quotes. This leads to a mismatch when comparing the expected command list with the actual one generated during the test. The test cases expect the property values to be without double quotes, causing the assertion errors.

### Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to remove the unnecessary double quotes around the property values when constructing the command list. By simply removing the double quotes in the format string used to append key-value pairs to the command list, we can ensure that the generated command list matches the expected one without any discrepancies.

### Corrected Version
```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, '{0}={1}'.format(prop, val)]
    return command
```
