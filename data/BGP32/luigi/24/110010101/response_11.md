### Analysis
1. The buggy function `_dict_arg` is supposed to construct a list of command arguments based on key-value pairs in a dictionary. The function iterates over the dictionary items and appends the key-value pairs to the `command` list in a specific format.
2. The bug seems to be related to how the function is formatting the key-value pairs. The error messages indicate that the values are being enclosed in double quotes when constructing the command list.
3. The bug causes the function to incorrectly format the key-value pairs as strings enclosed in double quotes, leading to assertion failures in the test cases.
4. To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the values are not enclosed in double quotes while constructing the command list.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we should modify the `_dict_arg` function to construct the command list without enclosing the values in double quotes. We can achieve this by directly appending the key and value without formatting them as strings.

### Corrected Version
```python
class SparkSubmitTask(luigi.Task):
    def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
        command = []
        if value and isinstance(value, dict):
            for prop, val in value.items():
                command += [name, prop + "=" + str(val)]
        return command
``` 

By removing the string formatting with double quotes and directly concatenating the key and value with an equal sign, we ensure that the key-value pairs are correctly formatted in the command list. This should fix the bug and make the function behave as expected in the given test cases.
