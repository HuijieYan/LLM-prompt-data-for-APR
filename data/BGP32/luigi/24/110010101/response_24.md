### Analysis:
1. The purpose of the `_dict_arg` function is to convert a dictionary into a command format where each key-value pair is represented as `name='value'`.
2. The bug in the function is related to the formatting of the key-value pairs. Currently, the function is wrapping the value within double quotes, which is causing the assertion errors in the tests.
3. The cause of the bug is that the function incorrectly includes double quotes around the value when generating the command list. The tests are expecting the values without double quotes.
4. To fix the bug, we need to remove the quotes around the value when formatting the command list.

### Proposed fix:
```python
class SparkSubmitTask(luigi.Task):
    """
    Template task for running a Spark job
    
    Supports running jobs on Spark local, standalone, Mesos or Yarn
    
    See http://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/submitting-applications.html
    for more information
    """

    def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
        command = []
        if value and isinstance(value, dict):
            for prop, val in value.items():  # Changed variable name from value to val to avoid shadowing
                command += [name, "{}={}".format(prop, val)]  # Removed unnecessary quotes
        return command
```

With this correction, the function will format the command list correctly without including unnecessary double quotes, which should resolve the assertion errors in the tests.
