### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_dict_arg` is expected to take in a name and a dictionary of properties and values, then construct a list of command arguments where each property is converted to a string in the format `"{prop}={value}"`.
2. The error messages indicate that the function is not formatting the properties correctly from the input dictionary. It seems to be adding unnecessary quotations around the property values.
3. The cause of the bug is that the buggy function is incorrectly formatting the property values with extra quotes, leading to a mismatch in the expected and actual command arguments.
4. To fix the bug, we need to remove the unnecessary quotes around the property values when constructing the command list.
5. Below is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, '{0}={1}'.format(prop, val)]
    return command
```

By removing the unnecessary quotes around `{prop}={val}`, the function will construct the command list correctly with the expected property values.
