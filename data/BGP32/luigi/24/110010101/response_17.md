### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_dict_arg` is supposed to convert a dictionary input into a list of command line arguments by formatting key-value pairs as strings with specific formatting.
2. The bug seems to be related to how the key-value pairs are formatted, causing extra double quotes to be included in the output list.
3. The error messages indicate that the function is not formatting the key-value pairs correctly, leading to assertion failures when comparing the expected output with the actual output.
4. To fix the bug, we need to remove the unnecessary double quotes around the formatted key-value pairs.

### Suggestions for fixing the bug:
1. Check the loop where the key-value pairs are formatted and ensure that the formatting does not include unnecessary quotes.
2. Modify the formatting code to remove the double quotes around the key and value pairs.

### Corrected version of the `_dict_arg` function:
```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, value in value.items():
            # Remove double quotes around prop=value formatting
            command += [name, '{0}={1}'.format(prop, value)]
    return command
```
