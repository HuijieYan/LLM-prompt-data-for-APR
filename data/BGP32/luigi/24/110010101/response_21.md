### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_dict_arg` takes in a `name` and a `value` parameter where `value` is expected to be a dictionary. It then iterates over the key-value pairs in the dictionary and appends them to a `command` list with a specific format.
2. The issue arises when the value is being processed into the command list. The bug seems to be related to how the key-value pairs are being formatted and added to the command list.
3. The error messages indicate that the values being added are not in the correct format, causing assertion errors in the test cases.
4. To fix the bug, we need to correctly format the key-value pairs from the dictionary into the desired format and add them to the command list.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Iterate over the key-value pairs in the dictionary.
2. Format each pair as `'prop=value'`.
3. Add the formatted pair to the `command` list.
4. Return the `command` list.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, '{0}={1}'.format(prop, val)]
    return command
```

By correcting the function as shown above, it should now properly format the key-value pairs from the dictionary and add them to the command list in the expected format. This should resolve the assertion errors in the failing test cases.
