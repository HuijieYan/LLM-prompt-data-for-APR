### Analysis
1. The function `_dict_arg` takes in a `name` (representing a command line argument) and a `value` (which should be a dictionary of properties and values).
2. The function is supposed to iterate over the key-value pairs in the input dictionary, format them correctly, and add them to the `command` list.
3. The current issue lies in the formatting of key-value pairs where quotes are being added unnecessarily to the values.
4. The error messages indicate that the expected output differs from the actual output due to the presence of unnecessary quotes.

### Bug Cause
The bug arises from the unnecessary addition of double quotes around the property values in the `command` list. This is causing a mismatch when comparing the expected and actual outputs.

### Fix Strategy
To correct the bug, we need to remove the quotes around the values while formatting the properties and values in the key-value pairs. This can be achieved by removing the `" "` around `{1}` in the format string during the construction of the command list.

### Corrected Version

```python
class SparkSubmitTask(luigi.Task):
    """
    Template task for running a Spark job
    
    Supports running jobs on Spark local, standalone, Mesos or Yarn
    
    See http://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/submitting-applications.html
    for more information
    """

    def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
        command = []
        if value and isinstance(value, dict):
            for prop, val in value.items():  # fix: rename value to val to avoid confusion
                command += [name, '{0}={1}'.format(prop, val)]  # fix: removed unnecessary quotes
        return command
```

By making these changes, unnecessary quotes around the property values will be removed, resulting in the correct formatting of the command list. This corrected version should now pass the failing test cases.
