### Analyzing the buggy function and the failing tests

1. The buggy function `_dict_arg` takes two parameters `name` and `value`, where `value` is expected to be a dictionary. It iterates over the key-value pairs in the dictionary and constructs a list `command` containing the formatted key-value pairs.

2. The failing test cases are testing the functionality of this `_dict_arg` function within the `SparkSubmitTask` class. The tests provide input dictionaries with key-value pairs and expect a list of formatted key-value pairs in return.

3. The error messages indicate that the function is not formatting the key-value pairs correctly, leading to assertions failures due to differences in the generated lists.

### Cause of the bug

The bug in the `_dict_arg` function arises from incorrectly formatting the key-value pairs in the `value` dictionary before appending them to the `command` list. The current implementation wraps the values in double quotes, resulting in mismatches with the expected list elements. The buggy function incorrectly constructs the key-value pairs as strings instead of plain key-value pairs.

### Strategy for fixing the bug

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the key-value pairs in the dictionary are correctly formatted without additional quotes. We should construct the key-value pairs directly as strings without enclosing them in quotes.

### Corrected function

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, '{0}={1}'.format(prop, val)]
    return command
```

With this corrected implementation, the function will correctly format the key-value pairs in the dictionary without unnecessary quotes, resolving the assertion failures in the tests.
