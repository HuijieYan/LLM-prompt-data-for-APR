### Analysis:
1. The `_dict_arg` function takes two parameters: `name` and `value`, where `value` is expected to be a dictionary. It iterates over the key-value pairs in the dictionary and appends them to a `command` list in a specific format.
2. The bug seems to be related to how the key-value pairs from the dictionary are formatted and appended to the `command` list.

### Error Cause:
The bug occurs because the function incorrectly formats the key-value pair by adding double quotes around the value. This results in a mismatch between the expected and actual output when comparing the command list.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to remove the unnecessary double quotes around the value when formatting the key-value pair in the command list.

### Corrected Version:
```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: luigi/contrib/spark.py

# The declaration of the class containing the buggy function
class SparkSubmitTask(luigi.Task):
    """
    Template task for running a Spark job
    
    Supports running jobs on Spark local, standalone, Mesos or Yarn
    
    See http://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/submitting-applications.html
    for more information
    """

    # Corrected version of the buggy function
    def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
        command = []
        if value and isinstance(value, dict):
            for prop, prop_value in value.items():
                command += [name, '{0}={1}'.format(prop, prop_value)]
        return command
```

By removing the double quotes around the value when formatting the key-value pair, the corrected version of the function should now correctly generate the command list as expected, passing the failing tests.
