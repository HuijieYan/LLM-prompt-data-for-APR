### Analysis
1. The buggy function `_dict_arg` takes in a `name` and a `value` parameter, where `value` is expected to be a dictionary.
2. The function iterates over the key-value pairs in the dictionary and constructs a command list by formatting the key-value pairs in a specific way.
3. The bug seems to be related to the formatting of the key-value pairs in the command list. It looks like the function is adding unnecessary double quotes around the values when constructing the command list.
4. To fix the bug, we should remove the double quotes around the formatted key-value pairs in the command list.
5. The corrected version of the function should format the key-value pairs without double quotes.

### Corrected Version
```python
class SparkSubmitTask(luigi.Task):
    """
    Template task for running a Spark job
    
    Supports running jobs on Spark local, standalone, Mesos or Yarn
    
    See http://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/submitting-applications.html
    for more information
    """
    
    def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
        command = []
        if value and isinstance(value, dict):
            for prop, val in value.items():  # Changed 'value' variable to 'val' to avoid shadowing
                command += [name, '{0}={1}'.format(prop, val)]  # Removed unnecessary double quotes
        return command
```

### Test the Corrected Version
After applying the above correction, the function should format the key-value pairs correctly without double quotes. This should satisfy the expected input/output values for the failing test cases.
