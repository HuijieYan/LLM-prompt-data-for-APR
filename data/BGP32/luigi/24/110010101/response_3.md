### Analysis
1. The buggy function `_dict_arg` is designed to take a `name` and `value` pair, where `value` is expected to be a dictionary. It then iterates over the dictionary items, creating a list of arguments to be passed to a command.
2. The bug seems to be related to how the key-value pairs from the dictionary are being formatted into strings before adding them to the command list.
3. The bug is caused by the unnecessary double quoting of the value string when formatting the argument `'="{0}={1}"'.format(prop, value)`. This results in the extra quotes present in the final command list.
4. To fix the bug, we should remove the unnecessary double quotes around the value when adding it to the command list.
5. Below is the corrected version of the buggy function.

### Corrected Version of the Function

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, '{0}={1}'.format(prop, val)]
    return command
```
