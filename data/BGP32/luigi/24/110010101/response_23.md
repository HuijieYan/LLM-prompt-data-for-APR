### Analysis
1. The buggy function `_dict_arg` is designed to convert a dictionary into a list of command line arguments. It is used in the context of submitting Spark jobs with various parameters.
2. The error message indicates that the function is not correctly converting the dictionary values into the desired format.
3. The cause of the bug is that the function incorrectly wraps the values of dictionary items with double quotes. The values should be appended directly without quotes to match the expected format.
4. To fix the bug, we need to modify the `_dict_arg` function to concatenate the name, property, and value without quotation marks.
5. The corrected version of the function is provided below.

### Corrected Version
```python
# The corrected version of the function
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, '{0}={1}'.format(prop, val)]
    return command
```

By removing the double quotes from the format string, the corrected function should now properly convert the dictionary values to the expected format without any quotes.
