The bug in the `_dict_arg` function is caused by enclosing the value pair in double quotes ('"{0}={1}"') in the `command` list. This results in an extra set of double quotes around the value when it should be a direct key-value pair without quotes.

To fix this bug, we need to remove the unnecessary double quotes around the key-value pair format in the `command` list.

Here is the corrected version of the `_dict_arg` function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, "{0}={1}".format(prop, val)]
    return command
```

With this correction, the function should now correctly format the key-value pairs without unnecessary double quotes, resolving the failing tests.
