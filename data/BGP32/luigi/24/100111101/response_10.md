### Bug Analysis:
The bug seems to be related to how the function `_dict_arg` handles dictionary values when constructing the `command` list. The current implementation wraps the dictionary values in double quotes, causing discrepancies in the expected output compared to the actual output. The function is not correctly formatting the key-value pairs from the dictionary into the command list.

### Bug Explanation:
In the failing tests, the expected input dictionary contains key-value pairs that should be formatted without double quotes. However, the current implementation of `_dict_arg` adds double quotes around the values, leading to a mismatch in the expected and actual command list generated.

### Bug Fix:
To fix the bug, we need to modify the `_dict_arg` function to format the key-value pairs from the dictionary without double quotes. This can be achieved by removing the double quotes when constructing each key-value pair.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, '{0}={1}'.format(prop, val)]
    return command
```

By using this corrected version, the function will format the key-value pairs without double quotes, aligning with the expected command list in the failing tests.
