The bug in the `_dict_arg` function arises from incorrectly adding quotation marks around the property values. The function is adding the property values inside double quotes (`"value"`) which is not expected based on the failing tests.

To fix the bug, we need to remove the double quotes around the property values before appending them to the `command` list. This correction will align the function's behavior with the expected input/output values from the failing test cases.

Here is the corrected version of the `_dict_arg` function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, '{0}={1}'.format(prop, val)]
    return command
```

With this correction, the function will construct the `command` list without wrapping the property values in double quotes. This adjustment should address the errors seen in the failing test cases.
