The bug in the `_dict_arg` function is due to the incorrect handling of dictionary values when constructing the `command` list. The function incorrectly adds double quotes around the property-value pair in the dictionary. This causes the mismatch in the expected and actual output values.

To fix the bug, simply remove the unnecessary double quotes around the property-value pair when constructing the command list.

Here is the corrected version of the `_dict_arg` function:

```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: luigi/contrib/spark.py

def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, '{0}={1}'.format(prop, val)]
    return command
```

By making this adjustment, the function should now correctly generate the command list without unnecessary double quotes around the property-value pairs, passing the failing tests with the expected input/output values.
