### Bug Explanation:
The bug in the `_dict_arg` function lies in how it constructs the command list based on the input dictionary `value`. The bug stems from the fact that the function incorrectly includes double quotes around the property-value pairs when appending them to the `command` list, leading to discrepancies in the expected and actual command list.

### Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to remove the unnecessary double quotes when constructing the key-value pairs in the command list. This will align the actual command list with the expected command list and ensure that the test cases pass successfully.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, '{0}={1}'.format(prop, val)]
    return command
```

By removing the double quotes around `{0}={1}`, the corrected function will correctly construct the command list without any unnecessary characters, satisfying the expected input/output values.
