### Bug Explanation
The bug in the `_dict_arg` function is due to the additional double quotes (`"`) being added around the value part of the command when constructing the list. This addition of quotes is unnecessary and causes the assertion error in the test cases.

### Fix Strategy
To fix this bug, we need to remove the double quotes around the value when constructing the command list. This will ensure that the command list is correctly formatted without unnecessary quotes.

### Corrected Version of the Function
```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():  # renaming to val instead of value
            command += [name, '{0}={1}'.format(prop, val)]  # no quotes around val
    return command
```

With this corrected version, the function should now properly format the command list without additional quotes, addressing the issue causing the failing test cases.
