The bug in the `_dict_arg` function arises from the incorrect formatting of the dictionary key-value pairs in the `command` list. The bug causes the values to be enclosed in double quotes when they shouldn't be. This discrepancy leads to assertion errors in the test cases.

To fix the bug, the code should be modified to remove the unnecessary double quotes around the property values when constructing the `command` list. Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, '{0}={1}'.format(prop, val)]
    return command
```

By making this change, the function will properly construct the command list with key-value pairs separated by `=` without enclosing them in quotes. This correction aligns with the expected values and types for both test cases provided and should make the failing tests pass.
