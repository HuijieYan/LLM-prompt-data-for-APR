The bug in the `_dict_arg` function lies in how it handles the dictionary values. Currently, it adds extra quotes around the values, leading to a difference in the expected and actual outputs. To fix this bug, the function should append the pair without quotes to the command list.

Here is the corrected version of the `_dict_arg` function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, '{0}={1}'.format(prop, val)]
    return command
```

By removing the extra quotes around the value in the format function, the corrected function now correctly formats the key-value pairs from the dictionary without adding unnecessary quotes.

This corrected version should now pass the failing tests and match the expected input/output values provided.
