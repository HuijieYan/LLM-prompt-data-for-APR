The bug in the `_dict_arg` function stems from the incorrect formatting of the command list when creating arguments from a dictionary. The function incorrectly adds double quotes around the value of each property, leading to a mismatch in the expected and actual values when compared in the test cases.

To fix this bug, we need to remove the unnecessary double quotes around the property values. Here is the corrected version of the `_dict_arg` function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, '{0}={1}'.format(prop, val)]
    return command
```

By making this change, the function will construct the command list without the extra double quotes, ensuring that it aligns correctly with the expected values in the test cases. This correction should address the failing tests and provide the expected outcome.
