### Bug Explanation:
The bug in the `_dict_arg` function occurs due to the incorrect formatting of values when generating the command list. The function is currently adding extra double quotes around the property-value pairs in the command list, leading to a mismatch with the expected output.

In the failing test cases, the values inside the command list have extra double quotes around them. For example, `'"Prop=Value"'` instead of `'Prop=Value'`. This discrepancy causes the test assertions to fail as the actual and expected command lists do not match.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to remove the extra double quotes around the property-value pairs when constructing the command list in the `_dict_arg` function. This can be achieved by modifying the string formatting used to build the command list.

### Corrected Version of the `_dict_arg` function:
```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, '{0}={1}'.format(prop, val)]
    return command
```

In the corrected version, the property-value pairs are formatted using `{0}={1}` without any additional quotes. This modification ensures that the command list is built correctly without any extra characters, aligning with the expected output in the failing tests.
