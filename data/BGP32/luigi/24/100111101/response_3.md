The issue in the `_dict_arg` function arises due to the unnecessary double-quoting of the property-value pair in the command list. This double-quoting leads to a mismatch with the expected values in the tests, causing the assertion errors.

To fix this bug, we need to remove the double-quoting of the property-value pair when constructing the command list.

Here is the corrected version of the `_dict_arg` function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():  # Changed variable name to val to avoid shadowing value
            command += [name, "{0}={1}".format(prop, val)]  # Removed unnecessary double-quoting
    return command
```

This correction ensures that the property-value pairs are formatted correctly without unnecessary quotes, aligning with the expected values in the tests.

After applying this fix, the function should pass both failing test cases and produce the expected command list without any assertion errors.
