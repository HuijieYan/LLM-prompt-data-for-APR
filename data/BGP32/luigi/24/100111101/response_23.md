The issue in the buggy function is caused by incorrectly generating the command list with quotation marks around the property and value pairs. This results in a mismatch when comparing the generated command list in the failing tests.

The bug is in the line:
```python
command += [name, '"{0}={1}"'.format(prop, value)]
```

To fix the bug, we need to remove the unnecessary quotation marks in the command list generation.

Here is the corrected version of the _dict_arg function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, value in value.items():
            command += [name, "{0}={1}".format(prop, value)]
    return command
```

With this correction, the function should now correctly generate the command list without unnecessary quotation marks, resolving the issue in the failing tests.
