### Bug Explanation:
The bug in the `_dict_arg` function arises from the fact that the original implementation was incorrectly formatting the dictionary key-value pairs. The function was wrapping the values in double quotes, causing discrepancies between the expected and actual output lists.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to modify the way key-value pairs from the dictionary are added to the command list. Specifically, we should not wrap the values in double quotes but rather just concatenate the key and value formatted as 'key=value'.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, '{0}={1}'.format(prop, val)]
    return command
```

By making this change, the function will now correctly format the key-value pairs from the dictionary without unnecessary double quotes, ensuring that the output matches the expected values in the test cases.
