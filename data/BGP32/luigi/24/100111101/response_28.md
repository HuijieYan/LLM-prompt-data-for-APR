The bug in the `_dict_arg` function is due to the incorrect formatting of dictionary key-value pairs when constructing the command list. The function is adding unnecessary quotes around the property-value pairs, leading to differences in the expected and actual command lists during the test cases.

### Bug Cause:
The cause of the bug is the use of unnecessary quotes around property-value pairs in the constructed command list. This results in mismatches when comparing the expected and actual command lists in the test cases.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to remove the unnecessary quotes when constructing the command list for dictionary key-value pairs. This will ensure that the expected and actual command lists match during the test cases.

### Corrected Function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, '{0}={1}'.format(prop, val)]
    return command
```

By making this correction, the function should now correctly construct the command list without unnecessary quotes around the property-value pairs. This will align with the expected command lists in the test cases and resolve the failing tests.
