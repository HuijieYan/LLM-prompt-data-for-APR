The bug in the `_dict_arg` function arises from incorrectly formatting the key-value pairs in the command list. The function is adding double quotes around the values, causing a mismatch with the expected output.

To fix this bug, we need to remove the double quotes around the values in the `command` list when constructing the command list.

Here is the corrected version of the `_dict_arg` function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, '{0}={1}'.format(prop, val)]
    return command
```

By removing the double quotes around the values, the corrected function now correctly formats the key-value pairs in the command list. This change should make the function behave as expected and pass the failing test cases.
