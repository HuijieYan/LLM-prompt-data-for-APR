## Bug Explanation
The bug in the `_dict_arg` function arises from how the function processes the dictionary items to construct the `command` list. When formatting the key-value pair of the dictionary, it includes double quotes around the value, resulting in a string value within the list instead of just the key-value pair separated by an equal sign.

For example, in the failing test case 1, the expected `command` list should contain `['--conf', 'Prop=Value']`, but the buggy function constructs it as `['--conf', '"Prop=Value"']`, causing the assertion to fail.

## Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, the function should construct the key-value pairs without double quotes around the value. This can be achieved by changing the line where the key-value pair is appended to the `command` list to remove the quotes from around the formatted string.

## Corrected Code
```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, '{0}={1}'.format(prop, val)]
    return command
```

By modifying the line to construct the `command` list without double quotes around the value, the corrected function now properly formats the key-value pairs in the expected format, resolving the bug.
