Based on the analysis provided, the issue in the `_dict_arg` function stems from incorrectly formatting the dictionary key-value pairs when constructing the command list. The function is currently adding double quotes around the key-value pairs, leading to discrepancies in the test cases. To fix this issue, we need to update the function to construct the command list without the unnecessary quotes.

Here is the corrected version of the `_dict_arg` function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():  # Changed variable name to val
            command += [name, '{0}={1}'.format(prop, val)]  # Removed double quotes
    return command
```

With this correction, the function should now correctly build the command list without unnecessary quotes around the key-value pairs. This fix aligns with the expected values and types provided in the failing test cases, ensuring that the function works as intended and passes the tests.
