### Bug Explanation
The bug in the `_dict_arg` function lies in the way the key-value pairs from the input dictionary are added to the `command` list. The bug occurs when the values are enclosed within double quotes, causing a mismatch with the expected output in the failing tests. This mismatch leads to an assertion error due to the differing formats of the values.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to modify the way key-value pairs are appended to the `command` list. Instead of enclosing the values within double quotes, we should directly append them in the format `key=value`. This adjustment will align the output format with the expected values in the failing tests.

### Corrected Version of the Function
```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: luigi/contrib/spark.py

def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():  # Changed variable name from 'value' to 'val' to avoid shadowing
            command += [name, '{}={}'.format(prop, val)]  # Modified the format to match key=value
    return command
``` 

After making this correction, the function will correctly format the key-value pairs from the input dictionary, leading to the expected outputs in the failing tests.
