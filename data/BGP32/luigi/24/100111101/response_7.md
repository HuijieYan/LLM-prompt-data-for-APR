The bug in the `_dict_arg` function arises from adding unnecessary quotes around the property and value when constructing the command list. This results in a mismatch when comparing the actual command list with the expected command list.

To fix this bug, we need to remove the unnecessary quotes while constructing the command list in the `_dict_arg` function.

Here is the corrected version of the `_dict_arg` function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, '{0}={1}'.format(prop, val)]
    return command
```

With this correction, the function will now correctly construct the command list without unnecessary quotes, and the failing tests should pass successfully.
