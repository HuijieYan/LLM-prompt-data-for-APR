### Analysis:
1. The `_dict_arg` function is intended to take a dictionary as input and convert it into a list of command line arguments.
2. The bug occurs in how the function is constructing the command list when appending the values from the dictionary.
3. The function incorrectly wraps the property and value in double quotes when adding them to the command list, causing a mismatch with the expected values in the failing test.
4. To fix the bug, we should remove the unnecessary double quotes while formatting the property and value in the command list.

### Updated Corrected Function:
```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, '{0}={1}'.format(prop, val)]
    return command
```

By removing the double quotes around the formatted `{prop}={val}`, we ensure that the command list is constructed correctly without additional quotes. This change should align the output of the function with the expected values in the failing tests.
