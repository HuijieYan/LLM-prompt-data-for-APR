### Correction:

Based on the analysis of the bug and the failing tests, the issue lies in the buggy function `_dict_arg` where it incorrectly adds quotes around the property values when constructing the command list. This results in a mismatch between the expected and actual command lists during the test comparisons leading to assertion failures.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the function to correctly format the property-value pairs without adding unnecessary quotes. 

Here is the corrected version of the `_dict_arg` function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, '{0}={1}'.format(prop, val)]
    return command
```

This corrected version removes the unnecessary quotes around the property values, ensuring that the command list is constructed correctly.

By applying this correction, the function should now pass the failing tests and produce the expected command lists for comparison.
