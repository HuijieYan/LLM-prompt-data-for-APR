The issue in the buggy function is related to how the key-value pairs from the input dictionary are formatted within the `command` list. The current implementation treats the value as a string, which causes incorrect formatting when generating the command list.

To fix this issue, we need to modify the way key-value pairs are added to the `command` list, ensuring that they are correctly formatted as `key=value` strings.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, '{0}={1}'.format(prop, val)]
    return command
```

By using `{0}={1}.format(prop, val)` instead of `"{0}={1}".format(prop, value)`, we correctly format the key-value pairs as expected.

This correction should resolve the issues encountered in the failing tests.
