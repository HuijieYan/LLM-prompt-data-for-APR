### Bug Explanation:
The bug in this `_dict_arg` function lies in how it handles assigning the key-value pairs to the command list. When constructing the command list, the original implementation wraps the value with double quotes which leads to a mismatch with the expected output in the failing tests.

In both failing cases, the `value` parameter is a dictionary with key-value pairs. The `name` parameter specifies the flag that precedes each key-value pair in the command list.

In the first failing test, the expected output should contain the key-value pair without double quotes. However, the buggy function incorrectly adds double quotes around the value, which causes the assertion error.

In the second failing test, the same issue occurs. The expected output needs the key-value pair without quotes, but the buggy function adds the quotes.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to modify the `_dict_arg` function to correctly construct the command list without wrapping the value in double quotes. We should concatenate the key, '=', and value directly without adding extra characters.

### Corrected Function:
```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, '{0}={1}'.format(prop, val)]
    return command
```

After making this adjustment, the function constructs the command list in the expected format without unnecessary quotes. This corrected version of the function should now pass both failing tests.
