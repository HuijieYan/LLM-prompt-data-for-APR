### Bug Explanation
The bug arises from the buggy function `_dict_arg` incorrectly formatting the dictionary key-values as strings with double quotes. This results in a mismatch between the expected and actual values in the test cases, leading to assertion failures.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to update the `_dict_arg` function to properly format the dictionary key-values without using double quotes around the values. This will ensure that the generated command list matches the expected values in the tests.

### Corrected Version of the Function
```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, '{0}={1}'.format(prop, val)]
    return command
```

By updating the function to this corrected version, the issue with incorrectly formatted key-value pairs will be resolved, and the function should pass the failing tests with the expected input/output values.
