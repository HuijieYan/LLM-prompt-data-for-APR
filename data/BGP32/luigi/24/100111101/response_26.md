The buggy function `_dict_arg` is not handling the dictionary values correctly when constructing the `command` list. The issue arises from adding extra quotes around the dictionary values in the command list.

### Cause of the bug:
- The bug is caused by the buggy function adding extra double quotes around the dictionary values when constructing the command list. This leads to a mismatch in the comparison during the test cases, resulting in assertion errors.

### Fix Strategy:
- Modify the function to remove the extra quotes around the dictionary values when constructing the command list.

### Corrected Version of the `_dict_arg` function:
```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, "{0}={1}".format(prop, val)]
    return command
```

With this corrected version of the function, the test cases should now pass without any assertion errors.
