### Bug Explanation
The bug in the `_dict_arg` function is caused by the incorrect handling of dictionary values when constructing the `command` list. The function currently wraps the property value pair in double quotes, which is unnecessary and causes discrepancies in the test cases. This is evident from the differing elements in the test outputs where the expected values do not have unnecessary quotes around the values.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to remove the unnecessary double quotes around the property values in the `command` list generation. This can be done by directly appending the property-value pair without adding quotes.

### Corrected Version of the Function
```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, '{0}={1}'.format(prop, val)]
    return command
```

By updating the function as above, the `command` list will be correctly constructed without unnecessary double quotes, aligning with the expected values in the failing test cases.
