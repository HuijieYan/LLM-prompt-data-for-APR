### Bug Explanation
The bug in the `_dict_arg` function is caused by incorrectly adding quotes around the property-value pairs within the command list. The buggy function wraps the property-value pair within double quotes which causes the actual runtime values to differ from the expected values, leading to test failures. 

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to remove the unnecessary double quotes around the property-value pairs added to the command list. By formatting the property-value pairs without quotes, we can ensure the actual runtime values match the expected values in the tests.

### Corrected Version of the Function
```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, "{0}={1}".format(prop, val)]
    return command
```

By removing the unnecessary double quotes around the property-value pairs when constructing the command list, the corrected function will now properly format the arguments as expected by the test cases, resolving the bug.
