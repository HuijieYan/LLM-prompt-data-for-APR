### Analyzing the buggy function and its relationship with the buggy class:

The buggy function `_dict_arg` is a method of the `SparkSubmitTask` class within the `luigi/contrib/spark.py` file. This method is intended to process a dictionary argument and format it into a list to be used in the command. The method iterates over the key-value pairs of the input dictionary and appends the formatted string to the `command` list.

### Identifying potential error locations within the buggy function:

1. The `if value and isinstance(value, dict):` condition checks if the input `value` is a non-empty dictionary. If the value is not a dictionary, this condition will fail.
2. The issue arises when the `_dict_arg` function formats a key-value pair from the dictionary by enclosing the value in double quotes, which may not be necessary in the final command.

### Explaining the cause of the bug:

The cause of the bug is that when formatting the dictionary values in the `command` list, the values are being enclosed in double quotes. However, the test does not expect the values to be enclosed in quotes, leading to a mismatch between the expected command list and the actual one. This discrepancy results in the assertion error in the test.

### Suggesting a strategy for fixing the bug:

To fix the bug, we need to modify the `_dict_arg` function to format the dictionary values without enclosing them in double quotes. This way, the output command list will match the expected command list in the test.

### Corrected Version of the `_dict_arg` function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, '{0}={1}'.format(prop, val)]
    return command
```

In the corrected version:
- Changed `{1}` to `{val}` to include the value without the unnecessary double quotes.
- Renamed the variable `value` inside the loop to `val` to avoid overwriting the function argument.

By making these changes, the `command` list will now be formatted correctly without unnecessary double quotes, resolving the assertion errors in the failing tests.
