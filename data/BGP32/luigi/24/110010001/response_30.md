### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_dict_arg` is part of the `SparkSubmitTask` class in `luigi/contrib/spark.py`.
2. The function is intended to convert a dictionary into a list of arguments in the format needed for a command.
3. The error messages indicate that the function is not correctly formatting the values from the dictionary into the list of arguments. It seems to be adding extra quotation marks around the argument values, leading to a mismatch when compared with the expected arguments.
4. The cause of the bug is the unnecessary addition of double quotation marks around the arguments in the command list, whereas the test cases expect the arguments to be simple string values without quotes.
5. To fix the bug, the function should append the argument names and values directly without including quotation marks.

### Corrected Version:
```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: luigi/contrib/spark.py

# The declaration of the class containing the corrected function
class SparkSubmitTask(luigi.Task):
    """
    Template task for running a Spark job
    
    Supports running jobs on Spark local, standalone, Mesos or Yarn
    
    See http://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/submitting-applications.html
    for more information
    """

    # Updated and corrected function
    def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
        command = []
        if value and isinstance(value, dict):
            for prop, prop_value in value.items():
                command += [name, '{}={}'.format(prop, prop_value)]
        return command
```

By removing the unnecessary quotation marks from the argument values, the corrected `_dict_arg` function should now produce the expected list of command arguments as simple string values. This change should fix the bug and allow the test cases to pass successfully.
