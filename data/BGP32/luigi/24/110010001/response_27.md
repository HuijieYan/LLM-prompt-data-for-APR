1. The buggy function `_dict_arg` is part of the `SparkSubmitTask` class in the `luigi.contrib.spark` module. It is intended to build a command list based on key-value pairs provided in a dictionary, but there are inconsistencies and issues with the way the command is constructed.

2. The potential error locations within the `_dict_arg` function are the way it handles constructing the command list based on the dictionary values.

3. The cause of the bug is that the function incorrectly adds quotes around key-value pairs in the command when building it. This leads to discrepancies in the expected command list and the actual command list when compared in the test cases, resulting in assertion errors.

4. To fix the bug, we need to modify the function `_dict_arg` to correctly format the key-value pairs without adding unnecessary quotes. The function should generate a command list like `['key1', 'value1', 'key2', 'value2', ...]` instead of `['key1', '"value1"', 'key2', '"value2"', ...]`.

5. Here is the corrected version of the `_dict_arg` function:
```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, f'{prop}={val}']
    return command
```

With this corrected version, the function will generate the command list without adding unnecessary quotes around values. This updated version should resolve the issues and allow the test cases to pass successfully.
