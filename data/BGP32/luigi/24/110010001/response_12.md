### Analysis:
1. **Buggy Function**: The `_dict_arg` function within the `SparkSubmitTask` class is intended to convert a dictionary of key-value pairs into a list of command-line arguments. However, there is a bug in how it creates the output list.
  
2. **Bug Location**: The bug is located in the loop inside the `_dict_arg` function where the key-value pairs from the input dictionary are being converted into command-line arguments.

3. **Cause of the Bug**:
   - The bug arises from treating the value within the dictionary as a string enclosed in double quotes `"` while constructing the command list. This results in the added quotes in the final list of arguments, leading to a mismatch with the expected list of arguments when compared by the test cases.

4. **Strategy for Fixing the Bug**:
   - The fix involves removing the unnecessary double quotes around the values when constructing the command list. This way, the values are directly added to the list of command-line arguments without additional quotes.

### Corrected Version:
```python
class SparkSubmitTask(luigi.Task):
    # Other code...

    def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
        command = []
        if value and isinstance(value, dict):
            for prop, val in value.items():  # Use a different variable name to avoid conflict
                command += [name, '{0}={1}'.format(prop, val)]  # Remove unnecessary quotes
        return command
```

By making this correction, the function will now correctly generate the list of command-line arguments without adding unnecessary quotes around the values. This should resolve the assertion errors in the test cases.
