### Analyzing the buggy function and its relationship with the buggy class

The buggy function `_dict_arg` is a method of the `SparkSubmitTask` class in the `luigi.contrib.spark` module. This method is responsible for converting a dictionary into a list of command-line arguments. The function checks if the `value` parameter is a dictionary and then iterates over its items, adding each key-value pair to the `command` list formatted as strings.

### Identified potential error locations within the buggy function

From the error messages provided by the failing tests, the issue seems to be in how the function formats the key-value pairs in the dictionary as command-line arguments. The current implementation wraps the value part in double quotes, which causes mismatches with the expected command line arguments in the tests.

### Explanation of the bug

The bug arises from the discrepancy between the expected format of command-line arguments in the tests and the actual output produced by the `_dict_arg` function. The function wraps the value parts of key-value pairs in double quotes, which the tests do not expect.

### Suggested strategy for fixing the bug

To fix the bug, we need to modify the `_dict_arg` function to ensure that it generates the command-line arguments without wrapping the values in double quotes. This will align the output with the expected format in the tests.

### Corrected version of the `_dict_arg` function

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command.extend([name, "{0}={1}".format(prop, val)])  # Correctly format key-value pair without quotes
    return command
```

In the corrected version of the `_dict_arg` function, the value part of the key-value pair is formatted using `{0}={1}` without quotes. This change ensures that the command-line arguments are generated in the expected format, resolving the discrepancies in the failing tests.
