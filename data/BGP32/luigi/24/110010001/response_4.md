1. The buggy function `_dict_arg` inside the `SparkSubmitTask` class is attempting to format a dictionary of Spark properties into a list of command-line arguments. However, the issue lies in how the function handles the dictionary values.
2. The potential error locations within the buggy function are the way it processes the dictionary items and converts them into command-line arguments.
3. The error message indicates that there is a mismatch between the expected command arguments and the actual command arguments generated by the function. It seems that the function is incorrectly quoting the values of the dictionary properties as strings with double quotes, leading to a list comparison failure.
4. To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the dictionary values are not quoted as strings when creating the command arguments list. Since the properties will already be in the correct key-value format, there is no need to add extra quotes.
5. Here is the corrected version of the `_dict_arg` function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, value in value.items():
            # Removed the unnecessary double quotes for values
            command += [name, '{0}={1}'.format(prop, value)]
    return command
``` 

With this correction, the function will correctly format the dictionary values into a list of command-line arguments without adding unnecessary quotes. This should address the list comparison failures in the test cases.
