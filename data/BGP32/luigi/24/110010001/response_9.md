### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_dict_arg` is intended to convert a dictionary into a list of key-value pairs for command line entry.
2. The error messages indicate that the function is not handling the conversion correctly, resulting in strings being enclosed in double quotes which causes a mismatch during comparison with expected values.
3. The bug occurs due to an additional set of double quotes being added around the value in the list, causing a mismatch with the expected list format.
4. To fix this bug, the function should not include double quotes around the value when converting the dictionary to a list.

### Bug Fix:
```python
class SparkSubmitTask(luigi.Task):
    # ... existing code

    def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
        command = []
        if value and isinstance(value, dict):
            for prop, val in value.items():
                command += [name, '{0}={1}'.format(prop, val)]  # Corrected line, removed double quotes around value
        return command
```

By removing the double quotes surrounding the `val` in the list creation, the corrected function will now generate the list without quotes, which should align with the expected values in the tests.
