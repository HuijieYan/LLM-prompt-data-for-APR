### Analysis:
1. The buggy function is `_dict_arg` located within the `SparkSubmitTask` class.
2. The function is intended to process dictionary arguments and convert them into command arguments.
3. The error message indicates that there is a discrepancy between the expected list of command arguments and the actual list returned by the `_dict_arg` function. This discrepancy is specifically related to how dictionary values are processed and formatted within the command list, leading to key-value pairs being enclosed within double quotes incorrectly.
4. To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the key-value pairs in the dictionary passed to the function are formatted correctly without enclosing the values in quotes.
5. We can modify the `_dict_arg` function to correct the formatting issue and ensure that dictionary values are added to the command list without quotes.

### Proposed Correction:
```python
import luigi

class SparkSubmitTask(luigi.Task):
    """
    Template task for running a Spark job
    
    Supports running jobs on Spark local, standalone, Mesos, or Yarn
    
    See http://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/submitting-applications.html
    for more information
    """

    def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
        command = []
        if value and isinstance(value, dict):
            for prop, val in value.items():  # Fix: Changed variable name to 'val'
                command += [name, '{0}={1}'.format(prop, val)]  # Fix: Removed unnecessary quotes
        return command
```

By making the changes above, the `_dict_arg` function will correctly format the key-value pairs from the dictionary without enclosing the values in quotes. This correction should address the formatting issue and allow the test cases to pass successfully.
