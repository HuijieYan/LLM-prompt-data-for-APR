### Analysis:
1. The `SparkSubmitTask` class has a method `_dict_arg` that is supposed to process a dictionary into a list of command line arguments.
2. The failing tests are due to a comparison mismatch between the expected command list and the actual command list generated by the `_dict_arg` function.
3. The cause of the bug is that within the `_dict_arg` function, when adding items to the `command` list, unnecessary double quotes are being added around the value. This causes a discrepancy in the expected and actual command lists leading to assertion errors.
4. To fix the bug, we need to remove the double quotes around the values being added to the command list while constructing the command line arguments list.
5. We need to modify the `_dict_arg` function by removing the unnecessary double quotes around the values being added.


### Bug Fix:
```python
class SparkSubmitTask(luigi.Task):
    """
    Template task for running a Spark job
    
    Supports running jobs on Spark local, standalone, Mesos or Yarn
    
    See http://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/submitting-applications.html
    for more information
    """

    def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
        command = []
        if value and isinstance(value, dict):
            for prop, val in value.items():
                command += [name, '{0}={1}'.format(prop, val)]  # Removed unnecessary double quotes from the format
        return command
```

By removing the unnecessary double quotes when formatting the command line arguments, the corrected `_dict_arg` function should now generate the command list without the issues seen in the failing tests.
