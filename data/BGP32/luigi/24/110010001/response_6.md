## Analysis:
The error message indicates that the output of the `_dict_arg` function is not correctly formatted as expected in the test case. The issue seems to be related to how the dictionary arguments are handled within the function.

## Potential Error Locations:
1. The way the dictionary properties are formatted and added to the `command` list.
2. The usage of double quotes around the dictionary values which causes formatting issues.

## Bug Cause:
The bug seems to be caused by including the dictionary values inside double quotes when appending to the `command` list within the `_dict_arg` function. This formatting is causing the assertion errors in the test cases.

## Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, it is necessary to remove the double quotes from around the dictionary values when adding them to the `command` list to correctly format the output of the function according to the expectations in the test cases.

## Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, '{0}={1}'.format(prop, val)]  # Removed double quotes around values
    return command
```

By making this simple change, the function should now correctly format the dictionary arguments without double quotes, resolving the assertion errors in the test cases.
