1. Analysis:
The buggy function `_dict_arg` in the `SparkSubmitTask` class is supposed to format arguments passed as dictionaries. However, it formats the arguments incorrectly, leading to a mismatch in the expected and actual arguments during testing.

2. Potential error locations:
- The way the function formats the dictionary values could be causing the error.
- Incorrect handling of dictionaries could result in mismatched arguments.

3. Cause of the bug:
The `_dict_arg` function adds double quotes around the value `"Prop=Value"`, which is a string representing a key-value pair from a dictionary. This incorrect formatting leads to the expected arguments not matching the actual arguments during testing, resulting in an AssertionError.

4. Strategy for fixing the bug:
To fix the bug, we need to remove the double quotes from around the key-value pair strings before adding them to the command list. This will ensure that the format of the arguments matches the expected format.

5. Corrected version of the `_dict_arg` function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, '{0}={1}'.format(prop, val)]
    return command
```

By modifying the `_dict_arg` function as shown above, the key-value pairs will be formatted correctly without including unnecessary double quotes. This correction should address the mismatch between the expected and actual arguments, resolving the issue identified during testing.
