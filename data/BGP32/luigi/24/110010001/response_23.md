### Analysis:
1. The `SparkSubmitTask` class has a function `_dict_arg` that is expected to process a dictionary argument and convert it into a list of command arguments for running a Spark job.
2. The error messages from the failing test indicate that there is an issue with how the dictionary is being processed and converted into command arguments.
3. The buggy function seems to be converting dictionary key-value pairs into strings with quotes, which is not the expected behavior. This leads to the discrepancy in the test cases where the expected command arguments are in a different format than the actual command arguments generated by the `_dict_arg` function.
4. The bug can be fixed by modifying the `_dict_arg` function to correctly handle dictionary key-value pairs without adding unnecessary quotes around the values.

### Fix Strategy:
1. Remove the quotes around the values in the generated command arguments.
2. Update the `_dict_arg` function to properly process the dictionary key-value pairs.

### Corrected Version:
```python
class SparkSubmitTask(luigi.Task):

    def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
        command = []
        if value and isinstance(value, dict):
            for prop, value in value.items():
                command += [name, '{}={}'.format(prop, value)]
        return command
```

By making this change, the function should now correctly process dictionary key-value pairs without introducing quotes around the values. This correction should make the function work as intended and pass the failing test cases.
