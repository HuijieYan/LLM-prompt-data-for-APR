### Analysis
- The function `_dict_arg` in the `SparkSubmitTask` class is supposed to take a dictionary `value` and construct a command list based on the key-value pairs in the dictionary.
- The error messages indicate that the function is not correctly handling the key-value pairs, resulting in differences in the generated command.
- The test failures occur because the function is adding double quotes around the values in the generated command, which is not expected in the test cases.

### Bug
- The bug in the `_dict_arg` function is that it is enclosing the values of key-value pairs in double quotes when constructing the command.
- This makes the generated command different from the expected command, leading to test failures.

### Fix Strategy
- Modify the `_dict_arg` function to construct the command without enclosing the values in double quotes.
- Only wrap the key-value pair format in double quotes if required.

### Corrected Version
```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: luigi/contrib/spark.py

# The declaration of the class containing the buggy function
class SparkSubmitTask(luigi.Task):
    """
    Template task for running a Spark job
    
    Supports running jobs on Spark local, standalone, Mesos or Yarn
    
    See http://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/submitting-applications.html
    for more information
    """

    # Corrected version of the buggy function
    def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
        command = []
        if value and isinstance(value, dict):
            for prop, value in value.items():
                # Check if the value needs to be wrapped in double quotes
                if ' ' in value:
                    command += [name, '{0}="{1}"'.format(prop, value)]
                else:
                    command += [name, '{0}={1}'.format(prop, value)]
        return command
```

By following this correction, the function will generate the command list without wrapping values in double quotes when unnecessary, aligning with the expected command in the test cases.
