## Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_dict_arg` is designed to take a key-value pair and convert it into a list of command arguments with the key-value pair separated by an equal sign.
2. The buggy function is called within the `SparkSubmitTask` class and it is used to generate the list of command arguments to submit a Spark job.
3. The error message indicates that there is a mismatch between the expected list of command arguments and the actual list of command arguments that were generated by the `_dict_arg` function. The issue seems to be related to the handling of the key-value pair in the generated command.
4. The bug is caused by the fact that the value for properties is being enclosed in double quotes unnecessarily when constructing the command list. This extra double quote is causing the mismatch between the expected and actual command lists.
5. To fix the bug, we need to remove the double quotes around the property value in the command list generated by the `_dict_arg` function.

## Proposed Fix:
1. Remove the unnecessary double quotes around the property value in the generated command list.
2. Ensure that the key-value pairs are correctly formatted as `key=value` in the command list.

Here is the corrected version of the `_dict_arg` function:
```python
    def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
        command = []
        if value and isinstance(value, dict):
            for prop, prop_value in value.items():
                command += [name, '{0}={1}'.format(prop, prop_value)]
        return command
```

By making this change, the function will correctly generate the command list without unnecessary double quotes around the property values. This should resolve the assertion errors in the failing tests.
