### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_dict_arg` in the `SparkSubmitTask` class is intended to convert a dictionary of properties into a list of arguments in the format required for a command.
2. Looking at the error messages, it seems that the function is converting the dictionary values into strings enclosed in double quotes, which is causing the mismatch in the expected and actual arguments list.
3. The issue is due to the incorrect formatting of the dictionary values as strings with double quotes. This causes discrepancies when comparing the expected and actual command arguments.
4. To fix the bug, we need to modify the `_dict_arg` function to correctly format the dictionary values without enclosing them in quotes.
5. We need to fix the `_dict_arg` function to resolve the formatting issue.

### Corrected Version:
```python
class SparkSubmitTask(luigi.Task):
    """
    Template task for running a Spark job
    
    Supports running jobs on Spark local, standalone, Mesos or Yarn
    
    See http://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/submitting-applications.html
    for more information
    """

    def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
        command = []
        if value and isinstance(value, dict):
            for prop, prop_value in value.items():  # Changed variable name "value" to "prop_value" to avoid naming conflict
                command += [name, '{0}={1}'.format(prop, prop_value)]  # Corrected formatting to get rid of double quotes
        return command
```

After correcting the function as shown above, re-run the tests to verify that the issue has been resolved.
