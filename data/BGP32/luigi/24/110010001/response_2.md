### Analysis:
1. The provided buggy function `_dict_arg` is intended to convert a dictionary into a list of command arguments.
2. The function iterates over the dictionary items and appends them to the `command` list in a specific format.
3. The error messages from the failing tests indicate differences in the format of the items in the command list, specifically related to quoting and formatting within the list elements.
4. The cause of the bug is related to how the values from the dictionary are added to the `command` list, including unnecessary quoting and formatting inconsistencies.
5. To fix the bug, we need to update the `_dict_arg` function to correctly format the dictionary elements as command line arguments without unnecessary quotes or formatting.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Remove unnecessary double quoting and formatting from the dictionary items added to the command list.
2. Ensure that each dictionary key-value pair is directly added to the command list without additional formatting.
3. Update the `_dict_arg` function to directly concatenate the command list with each key and value pair from the dictionary.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, "{0}={1}".format(prop, val)]  # Directly concatenate key=value pairs without unnecessary quoting
    return command
```

By making the above correction, the bug should be fixed, and the failing tests should pass as the dictionary items will be formatted correctly in the command list without additional quoting.
