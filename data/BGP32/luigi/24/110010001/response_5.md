1. The buggy function `_dict_arg` is defined within the class `SparkSubmitTask` in the file `luigi/contrib/spark.py`. This class is responsible for running Spark jobs and the `_dict_arg` function is used to generate command arguments from a dictionary. The error message in the failing tests is related to the mismatch in command arguments generated by `_dict_arg` function.

2. The potential error locations within the `_dict_arg` function could be the way the dictionary values are handled while creating the command list.

3. The cause of the bug is that the function is incorrectly encapsulating the dictionary values with double quotes, causing them to be treated as string literals instead of proper arguments. This leads to the assertion error in the tests.

4. To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the dictionary values are not enclosed in double quotes when constructing the command list. This will ensure that the generated command arguments are correctly formatted and match the expected output in the test cases.

5. Here is the corrected version of the `_dict_arg` function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, '{0}={1}'.format(prop, val)]  # Fixed: Remove double quotes around {0}={1}
    return command
```

By removing the double quotes when formatting the dictionary key-value pairs, we ensure that the command list contains properly formatted arguments, resolving the assertion errors in the failing tests.
