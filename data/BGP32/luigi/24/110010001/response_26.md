### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_dict_arg` inside the `SparkSubmitTask` class is used to create a list of command arguments from a dictionary passed as an argument.
2. The function is intended to iterate over the key-value pairs of the dictionary and format them as strings to be added to the `command` list.
3. The issue arises due to incorrect formatting of the key-value pairs in the resulting list, causing assertion errors in the test cases.
4. The cause of the bug is that the values in the dictionary are being wrapped in double quotes unnecessarily which leads to a mismatch in the expected and actual command lists.
5. To fix the bug, we need to remove the unnecessary quotes around the values when formatting the key-value pairs.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
1. Iterate over the key-value pairs of the dictionary and create command arguments without wrapping the values in double quotes.
2. Update the `_dict_arg` function to correctly format the key-value pairs without unnecessary quotes.
3. Verify that the corrected function produces the expected command list when used in the test cases.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, '{0}={1}'.format(prop, val)]
    return command
```

By making the above correction in the `_dict_arg` function, the unnecessary double quotes around the values will be removed, and the function should work correctly to generate the command list as expected by the test cases.
