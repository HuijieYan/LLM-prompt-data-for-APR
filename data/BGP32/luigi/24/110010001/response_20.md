### Analysis
1. The `SparkSubmitTask` class contains a method `_dict_arg` that is supposed to convert a dictionary into a list of command line arguments.
2. The function loops through the key-value pairs of the dictionary and appends the formatted string to a list named `command`.
3. The error messages from the failing tests indicate a problem with how the function is handling the dictionary key-value pairs, specifically with quotes and formatting.
4. The bug seems to be related to how the function is handling the values from the dictionary when constructing the command list.

### Bug Cause
The bug is caused by the function adding extra quotes around the property and value pairs in the command list. The tests are comparing the output without the extra quotes, causing the assertions to fail.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to remove the additional quotes around the property and value pairs when constructing the command list.

### Corrected Version
```python
class SparkSubmitTask(luigi.Task):
    """
    Template task for running a Spark job
    
    Supports running jobs on Spark local, standalone, Mesos, or Yarn
    
    See http://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/submitting-applications.html
    for more information
    """

    def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
        command = []
        if value and isinstance(value, dict):
            for prop, value in value.items():
                command += [name, '{0}={1}'.format(prop, value)]
        return command
```

By correcting the `_dict_arg` function to remove the extra quotes, the function will now properly format the command list, resolving the comparison issues in the failing tests.
