## Analysis
1. The buggy function `_dict_arg` is not correctly converting a dictionary into command arguments for Spark job submission.
2. The error message indicates a mismatch between the expected output command list and the actual output command list due to the representation of dictionary values as strings vs. plain values.
3. The cause of the bug is that the function mistakenly surrounds dictionary values with double quotes, causing the strings to differ when comparing the command lists.
4. To fix the bug, we need to ensure that dictionary values are added to the command list as plain values without surrounding them with double quotes.

## Fixing the Bug
```python
class SparkSubmitTask(luigi.Task):
    """
    Template task for running a Spark job
    
    Supports running jobs on Spark local, standalone, Mesos or Yarn
    
    See http://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/submitting-applications.html
    for more information
    """

    def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
        command = []
        if value and isinstance(value, dict):
            for prop, val in value.items():
                command += [name, '{0}={1}'.format(prop, val)]  # Changed to add dictionary values without double quotes
        return command
```

By updating the `_dict_arg()` function to add dictionary values without double quotes, the bug should be fixed and the test cases should pass successfully.
