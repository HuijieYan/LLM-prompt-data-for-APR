### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_dict_arg` in the `SparkSubmitTask` class is intended to convert a dictionary into a list of command-line arguments.
2. The function iterates through the dictionary items and appends the key-value pairs to the `command` list.
3. The error messages indicate that the function is not formatting the arguments as expected, leading to assertion failures in the test cases.
4. The discrepancies in the argument formatting are caused by unnecessary quotation marks around the values in the generated command list.

### Bug Cause:
The bug arises from the unnecessary use of double quotes around the values when formatting the command arguments from the dictionary.

### Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, remove the double quotes around the value formatting in the command generation part of the function.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():  # Use different variable name to avoid conflict
            command += [name, '{0}={1}'.format(prop, val)]  # Remove double quotes around value
    return command
```

After making this change, the function should correctly generate command arguments without unnecessary quoting, matching the expected format in the test cases.
