### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_dict_arg` is a part of the class `SparkSubmitTask` which is used for running Spark jobs.
2. The error messages indicate that there is a mismatch in the format of parameters passed to the subprocess Popen function when running Spark jobs.
3. The function `_dict_arg` as defined appears to be unnecessarily wrapping certain values in double quotes which is causing the format mismatch in the subprocess Popen function call. This is evident from the error message indicating that the values don't match due to the presence of additional double quotes in one of the lists.
4. To fix the bug, we need to modify the `_dict_arg` function to remove the unnecessary double quotes from the formatted values.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
1. Update the `_dict_arg` function to json.dumps the values instead of formatting them manually.
2. Ensure that the parameters passed to the subprocess Popen function have the correct format without unnecessary double quotes.

### Corrected Version:
```python
class SparkSubmitTask(luigi.Task):
    """
    Template task for running a Spark job
    
    Supports running jobs on Spark local, standalone, Mesos or Yarn
    
    See http://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/submitting-applications.html
    for more information
    """

    def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
        command = []
        if value and isinstance(value, dict):
            for prop, value in value.items():
                command += [name, '{}={}'.format(prop, value)]
        return command
```

With this corrected version, the unnecessary double quotes will be removed from the values passed to the subprocess Popen function, fixing the format mismatch issue.
