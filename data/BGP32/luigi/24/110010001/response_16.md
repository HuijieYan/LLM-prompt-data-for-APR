### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_dict_arg` is trying to create a list of command arguments based on a dictionary passed as input.
2. The error messages indicate that there is a mismatch in the way values are handled in the generated command list, specifically with respect to quoted string values and non-quoted values.
3. The cause of the bug is that the function is wrapping all values in double quotes even when they are not necessary, causing a mismatch with the expected command list.
4. The strategy for fixing the bug is to handle the values based on whether they need to be quoted or not based on the context in which they are used.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            if isinstance(val, str):
                command += [name, '{}={}'.format(prop, val)]
            else:
                command += [name, '{}={}'.format(prop, '"{}"'.format(val))]
    return command
```

In the corrected version, we check the type of the value before adding it to the command list. If the value is a string, it is added without quotes; if it's not a string, it is wrapped in double quotes before adding to the list. This approach ensures that the generated command list matches the expected list without any unnecessary quotes.
