### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_dict_arg` is designed to convert a dictionary into a list of strings, where each key-value pair becomes a string element in the list.
2. The function checks if the input `value` is a dictionary and then iterates over its items to construct the command list.
3. The error messages indicate that there is an issue with how quotes are handled in the generated command list. The test cases expect the format without quotes for certain key-value pairs.
4. The root cause of the bug is the unnecessary inclusion of quotes around key-value pairs in the command list when constructing it from the dictionary, causing a mismatch with the expected format in the test cases.
5. The strategy for fixing the bug is to remove the quotes around the value when constructing the command list.

### Corrected Version:
```python
class SparkSubmitTask(luigi.Task):
    def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
        command = []
        if value and isinstance(value, dict):
            for prop, val in value.items():
                command += [name, '{}={}'.format(prop, val)]
        return command
```

By removing the unnecessary quotes around `{}` in the `format` method, we ensure that the key-value pairs are added to the `command` list without quotes, matching the expected format in the test cases.
