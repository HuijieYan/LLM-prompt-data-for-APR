1. The buggy function `_dict_arg` is a method within the class `SparkSubmitTask` in the `luigi.contrib.spark.py` file. It is intended to take a dictionary and convert it into a list of command-line arguments. The error message from the failing test indicates that there is a discrepancy between the expected list of arguments and the actual list of arguments generated by the `_dict_arg` method. The bug seems to be related to how the dictionary key-value pairs are converted to command-line arguments.

2. The potential error location within the `_dict_arg` function is in the line where the dictionary key-value pairs are appended to the `command` list. Specifically, the issue may lie in how the key-value pairs are formatted into strings within the list.

3. The cause of the bug is that the key-value pairs from the dictionary were being added to the command list as strings enclosed in double quotes, leading to discrepancies in the final command list format. The error message shows that the key-value pair is expected to be in the format `'Prop=Value'` but is actually generated as `'"Prop=Value"'` (with extra double quotes). This discrepancy causes the test to fail when comparing the expected and actual command lists.

4. To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the key-value pairs are added to the command list without the extra double quotes. This can be achieved by removing the double quotes in the string formatting when appending the key-value pairs to the command list.

5. Here is the corrected version of the `_dict_arg` function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, '{0}={1}'.format(prop, val)]  # Corrected the string formatting to remove extra quotes
    return command
```

By making this change, the key-value pairs will be added to the command list without extra quotes, resolving the discrepancy and allowing the test to pass successfully.
