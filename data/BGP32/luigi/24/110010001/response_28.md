### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_dict_arg` within the `SparkSubmitTask` class is taking `name` and `value` arguments and constructing a command list based on the dictionary `value`.
2. The error messages in the failing tests indicate that there is a discrepancy between the expected output and the actual output when constructing the command in `_dict_arg`.
3. The cause of the bug is that the `_dict_arg` function is incorrectly wrapping the values in quotes which is causing the assertion errors in the tests.
4. To fix the bug, we need to remove the unnecessary quotes around the values when constructing the command list.

### Bug Fix:
```python
class SparkSubmitTask(luigi.Task):
    """
    Template task for running a Spark job
    
    Supports running jobs on Spark local, standalone, Mesos or Yarn
    
    See http://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/submitting-applications.html
    for more information
    """

    def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
        command = []
        if value and isinstance(value, dict):
            for prop, prop_value in value.items():
                command += [name, "{0}={1}".format(prop, prop_value)]  # Fix: Removed unnecessary quotes
        return command
```

After applying this fix, the `_dict_arg` function should construct the command list without wrapping the values in unnecessary quotes, resolving the assertion errors in the failing tests.
