### Analysis:
1. The function `_dict_arg` is part of the `SparkSubmitTask` class in the `luigi/contrib/spark.py` file.
2. The error messages indicate that there are issues with how dictionary arguments are handled in the command construction produced by the `_dict_arg` function.
3. The cause of the bug is that the properties from the dictionary are being enclosed in double quotes unnecessarily in the generated command list, causing a mismatch during comparison with the expected command list in the test.
4. To fix the bug, we need to remove the unnecessary double quotes around the property values in the command list construction.
5. The corrected version of the function is provided below.

### Corrected Function:
```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command.extend([name, '{0}={1}'.format(prop, val)])
    return command
``` 

By removing the double quotes around `{0}={1}` in the `format` function, we ensure that the properties are directly added without any extra quotes that were causing the mismatch in the test comparisons.
