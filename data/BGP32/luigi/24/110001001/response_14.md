### Explanation of the bug

The bug in the `_dict_arg` function lies in the fact that the loop variable in the for loop that iterates over the dictionary items is named the same as the function's input parameter `value`. This causes the original `value` parameter to be overwritten in each iteration of the loop, leading to incorrect behavior and output.

### Strategy for fixing the bug

To fix the bug, we need to rename the loop variable inside the for loop to something other than `value`, so as not to shadow the original parameter. This will ensure that the original `value` parameter is preserved throughout the loop iterations.

### Corrected version of the function

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, '"{0}={1}"'.format(prop, val)]
    return command
``` 

By renaming the loop variable to `val` instead of `value`, we ensure that the original `value` parameter is not unintentionally modified within the loop iterations. This corrected version should now function properly without overwriting input values.
