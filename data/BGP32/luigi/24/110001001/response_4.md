### Explanation of the bug
The bug in the `_dict_arg` function is due to the misuse of variable names within the loop. The loop uses the same variable name 'value' for both the loop iteration variable and the value inside the dictionary. This overwrites the original 'value' input, leading to incorrect command generation.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to differentiate the loop iteration variable from the value inside the dictionary. One common practice is to use a different variable name for the loop iteration variable, for example `key` instead of `value`, which will prevent the original value from being overwritten.

### Corrected Version of the Function
```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for key, val in value.items():
            command += [name, '"{0}={1}"'.format(key, val)]
    return command
```
