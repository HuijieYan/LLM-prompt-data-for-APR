The bug in the `_dict_arg` function is that it modifies the input variable `value` by reusing it in the loop. This causes unexpected behavior and incorrect results as seen in the output values provided for the test cases.

To fix this bug, we need to use a different variable name inside the loop to avoid overwriting the input variable. Here is the corrected version of the `_dict_arg` function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, '"{0}={1}"'.format(prop, val)]
    return command
```

With this correction, the input `value` will not be modified during the loop, and the function should now provide the correct output as seen in the test cases provided.
