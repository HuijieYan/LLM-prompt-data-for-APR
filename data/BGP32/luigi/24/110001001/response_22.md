### Bug Explanation
The bug in the `_dict_arg` function lies in the fact that it is reusing the variable name `value` both as the input parameter and as the loop variable in the `for` loop. This causes an issue because the loop variable `value` overwrites the input value dictionary, leading to incorrect output.

### Bug Fix
To fix this bug, we need to rename the loop variable `value` to something else to avoid conflicting with the input parameter `value`.

### Corrected Version
```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, '"{0}={1}"'.format(prop, val)]
    return command
```

By renaming the loop variable `value` to `val`, we prevent the overwrite of the input dictionary, fixing the bug.
