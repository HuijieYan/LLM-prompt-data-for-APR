### Explanation of the bug
The bug in the `_dict_arg` function lies in the renaming conflict between the loop variable name `value` and the argument value of the function. This leads to the loop variable `value` overwriting the argument value `value`, causing unexpected behavior.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix this bug, we need to rename the loop variable in the for loop from `value` to something else to avoid overwriting the argument value `value`. By using a different variable name for the loop iteration, we can prevent conflicts and ensure correct functionality of the function.

### Corrected Version of the Function
```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, '"{0}={1}"'.format(prop, val)]
    return command
``` 

By renaming the loop variable `value` to `val` in the for loop, we ensure that it does not conflict with the argument value `value`, resolving the bug in the function.
