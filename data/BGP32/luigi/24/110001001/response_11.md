The bug in the `_dict_arg` function arises from the fact that the loop variable `value` is being re-assigned within the loop, causing the loop to terminate prematurely. This behavior leads to only the first key-value pair of the dictionary being processed.

To fix this bug, you can simply change the loop variable name from `value` to something else, avoiding the conflict with the outer function's `value` parameter.

Here is the corrected version of the `_dict_arg` function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for k, v in value.items():  # Changed variable name from value to k, v
            command += [name, '"{0}={1}"'.format(k, v)]
    return command
```

With this correction, the loop variable within the loop is named `k, v` instead of `value`, preventing the conflict and ensuring that all key-value pairs in the input dictionary are properly processed.
