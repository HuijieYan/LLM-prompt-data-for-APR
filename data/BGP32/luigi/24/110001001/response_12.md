### Explanation of the bug
The bug in the `_dict_arg` function lies in the fact that the nested variable `value` inside the loop is being overwritten by the loop variable, which causes incorrect behavior. The loop variable `value` is being used for both the key in the dictionary loop and the value associated with that key, causing the function to concatenate the property `--conf` multiple times with only the last key-value pair in the dictionary.

### Suggested strategy for fixing the bug
To fix the bug in the `_dict_arg` function, we need to rename the loop variable inside the loop, so it doesn't overwrite the original `value` variable provided as an argument to the function. By updating the loop variable's name to something different, we can correctly iterate over the dictionary items and construct the command list with the correct key-value pairs.

### Corrected version of the `_dict_arg` function
```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, prop_value in value.items():
            command.append(name)
            command.append('"{0}={1}"'.format(prop, prop_value))
    return command
```
