### Bug Explanation
The bug in the `_dict_arg` function lies in the fact that the inner loop variable `value` is being used both as the loop variable and as a reference to the input variable. This causes the loop to override the `value` parameter, leading to incorrect data being appended to the `command` list.

### Bug Fix
To fix this bug, we need to use a different variable name for the loop variable in the inner loop. Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, '"{0}={1}"'.format(prop, val)]
    return command
```

By using `val` as the loop variable inside the loop instead of `value`, we can avoid conflicts and ensure that the correct data is being appended to the `command` list.
