### Explanation of the bug
The bug in the `_dict_arg` function is caused by reusing the variable name `value` inside the loop that iterates over the dictionary values. This reassignment causes the original `value` variable, which is passed as an argument to the function, to be overwritten, resulting in incorrect values being used to construct the command list.

### Strategy for fixing the bug
To fix the bug, we need to change the variable name inside the loop that iterates over the dictionary values. By using a different variable name, we can avoid overwriting the original `value` variable passed as an argument to the function.

### Corrected version of the function
```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, '"{0}={1}"'.format(prop, val)]
    return command
``` 

By changing `value` to `val` inside the loop, we ensure that the original input value is not overwritten and the correct values are used to construct the command list.
