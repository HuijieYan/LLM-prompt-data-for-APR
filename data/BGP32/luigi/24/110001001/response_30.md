### Explanation of the bug
The bug in the `_dict_arg` function is caused by the fact that the loop variable `value` is being overwritten in the loop iteration. This leads to incorrect behavior when constructing the `command` list because the inner loop is using `value` to store the inner dictionary values, leading to unexpected results.

### Strategy for fixing the bug
To fix the bug, we need to avoid overwriting the loop variable `value` with the inner dictionary value. We can achieve this by using a different variable name for the inner loop. 

### Corrected version of the function
```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():  # Use val instead of value to store inner dictionary value
            command += [name, '"{0}={1}"'.format(prop, val)]
    return command
```

By making this change, the function will correctly construct the `command` list based on the input dictionary without overwriting the loop variable. This should address the bug and produce the expected output.
