The bug in the `_dict_arg` function arises from reusing the variable name `value` both as an input parameter and as a loop variable inside the function. This causes the loop to overwrite the value of the input parameter `value`, leading to unexpected behavior.

To fix this issue, we should use a different variable name for the loop variable. Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, '"{0}={1}"'.format(prop, val)]
    return command
```

By using `val` as the loop variable instead of `value`, we prevent overwriting the input parameter and ensure that the function behaves as expected.
