The bug in the `_dict_arg` function arises from reusing the variable name `value` inside the loop that iterates over the dictionary items, causing it to overwrite the original `value` input parameter. This leads to incorrect formatting of the command list, resulting in unexpected behavior.

To fix the bug, we need to use a different variable name inside the loop to avoid overwriting the original `value` input parameter. Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, '"{0}={1}"'.format(prop, val)]
    return command
```

By changing the variable name from `value` to `val` inside the loop, we prevent the overwrite issue and ensure that the command list is correctly formatted. This fix should address the bug and allow the function to work as intended.
