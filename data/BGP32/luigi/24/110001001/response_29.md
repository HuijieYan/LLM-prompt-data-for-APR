### Explanation:
The buggy function `_dict_arg` is intended to convert a dictionary `value` into a list of command-line arguments formatted as strings. However, there is a bug in the function where it reuses the variable name `value` in the inner loop that iterates over the dictionary items.

### Steps to fix the bug:
- The bug occurs because the inner loop is using the same variable name `value` as the dictionary value inside the loop, which causes unexpected behavior.
- To fix the bug, we need to rename the variable in the inner loop to avoid conflicts with the outer value variable.

### Corrected version of the buggy function:
```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():  # renamed the value variable to val
            command += [name, '"{0}={1}"'.format(prop, val)]  # updated to use val instead of value
    return command
```

By renaming the variable in the inner loop to `val`, we ensure that it doesn't conflict with the outer variable `value`. This fix should address the bug and correctly generate the command list with key-value pairs formatted as strings.
