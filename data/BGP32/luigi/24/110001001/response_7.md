### Bug Explanation
The bug in the `_dict_arg` function lies in the fact that it overwrites the variable `value` inside the loop that iterates over the dictionary items. This causes the function to only consider the last key-value pair in the dictionary, resulting in an incomplete `command` list.

### Bug Fix
To fix the bug, you can simply change the variable name used inside the loop from `value` to something else to avoid overwriting the original `value` parameter. Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():  # Changed variable name here
            command += [name, '"{0}={1}"'.format(prop, val)]  # Used the new variable name
    return command
```

With this change, the function will correctly iterate over all key-value pairs in the dictionary and construct the `command` list with all properties included.
