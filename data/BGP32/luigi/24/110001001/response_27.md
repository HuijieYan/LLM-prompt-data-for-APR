### Explanation:
The bug in the `_dict_arg` function stems from reusing the variable name `value` in the loop within the function. This causes the original `value` parameter to be overwritten, leading to unexpected behavior and incorrect output. This is due to the fact that the inner loop variable `value` is masking the outer scope variable `value`.

### Fix:
To fix this bug, you should use a different variable name for the inner loop to avoid overwriting the original `value` parameter. Here is the corrected version of the `_dict_arg` function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, '"{0}={1}"'.format(prop, val)]
    return command
```

By using `val` in the loop instead of `value`, we ensure that the original `value` parameter is not affected and the function behaves correctly.
