### Explanation:
The bug in the `_dict_arg` function arises from the fact that the inner loop variable `value` is being used both as the loop iterator and as the value of the dictionary key in the line `for prop, value in value.items():`. This leads to overwriting the original `value` dictionary with individual key-value pairs in each iteration, causing unexpected behavior.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to change the loop variable name from `value` to something else, so it does not conflict with the outer variable name. Additionally, we can simplify the code by directly accessing the key and value in the loop.

### Corrected Version:
```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: luigi/contrib/spark.py

# The declaration of the class containing the buggy function
class SparkSubmitTask(luigi.Task):
    """
    Template task for running a Spark job
    
    Supports running jobs on Spark local, standalone, Mesos or Yarn
    
    See http://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/submitting-applications.html
    for more information
    """




    # this is the corrected function
    def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
        command = []
        if value and isinstance(value, dict):
            for prop, val in value.items():
                command += [name, '"{0}={1}"'.format(prop, val)]
        return command
```
