### Explanation:
The bug in the `_dict_arg` function lies in using the same variable `value` in the loop to iterate over the dictionary keys and values. This causes the original `value` parameter to be overridden with the value of each key in the dictionary during the iteration. As a result, the function incorrectly captures the last key's value for the `value` parameter.

### Strategy for fixing the bug:
To fix the bug, we need to use different variable names inside the loop to avoid overwriting the original `value` parameter. This way, we can construct the `command` list correctly without losing any key-value pairs from the input dictionary.

### Corrected version of the function:
```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, '"{0}={1}"'.format(prop, val)]
    return command
``` 

By changing `value` to `val` inside the loop, we ensure that the dictionary key-value pairs are correctly appended to the `command` list without any data loss.
