### Analysis
The `_dict_arg` function is intended to take a name and a dictionary as input, format the dictionary key-value pairs, and append them to the command list. However, there is an issue in the function where the variable name `value` is used both as the input parameter name and as the iteration variable in the loop. This causes the original `value` provided as input to be overwritten.

### Bug Explanation
In the buggy function, when iterating over the dictionary items to construct the command list, the variable `value` is re-assigned as the value of each dictionary item. This overwrites the original `value` passed to the function, causing incorrect output.

### Bug Fix
To fix the bug, you can simply rename the iteration variable inside the loop to avoid overwriting the original input value. Here's the corrected version of the `_dict_arg` function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, prop_value in value.items():  # Fix: Changed the iteration variable name to prop_value
            command += [name, '"{0}={1}"'.format(prop, prop_value)]
    return command
```

With this fix, the function should correctly construct the command list without overwriting the original `value` input.
