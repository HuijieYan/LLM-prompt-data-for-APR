### Explanation
The bug in the `_dict_arg` function arises from reusing the variable name `value` in the loop that iterates over the `value` dictionary. This causes the original `value` parameter to be overwritten within the loop, leading to incorrect behavior when constructing the command list.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, you need to use a different variable name in the loop to avoid overwriting the original `value` parameter. This will ensure that the correct values are used to construct the command list.

### Corrected Version
```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, prop_value in value.items():  # Use a different variable name here
            command += [name, '"{0}={1}"'.format(prop, prop_value)]
    return command
``` 

By changing the variable name in the for loop to `prop_value`, we prevent the original `value` from being overwritten and ensure that the correct properties and values are used to construct the command list. This corrected version should now behave as intended without any bugs.
