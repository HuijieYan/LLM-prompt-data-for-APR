### Explanation of the bug:
The bug in the `_dict_arg` function lies in the usage of the variable name in the loop, which is being reassigned in the loop. Because of this reassignment, the original `name` value passed to the function is lost, resulting in incorrect command generation.

### Strategy for fixing the bug:
To fix the bug, we need to use a different variable name for the loop iteration variable instead of reusing the `name` variable. This will ensure that the original `name` value is preserved and used correctly to construct the command list.

### Corrected version of the function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, prop_value in value.items():  # Use a different variable name for loop iteration
            command += [name, '"{0}={1}"'.format(prop, prop_value)]
    return command
``` 

By making this modification, the function should now correctly generate the command list based on the input parameters without losing the original `name` value.
