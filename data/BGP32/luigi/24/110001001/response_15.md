### Explanation:
The bug in the `_dict_arg` function lies in the fact that the variable `value` is used as both the input parameter and a loop variable inside the function. This causes the function to modify the original `value` dictionary when constructing the command list, leading to unexpected behavior and incorrect results.

### Strategy for fixing the bug:
To fix the bug, we need to avoid using the same variable name `value` for both the input parameter and loop variable inside the function. We can rename the loop variable to something like `value_pair` to differentiate it from the input parameter. This way, we can properly iterate over the key-value pairs in the `value` dictionary without modifying the original dictionary.

### Corrected Version:
```python
class SparkSubmitTask(luigi.Task):
    """
    Template task for running a Spark job
    
    Supports running jobs on Spark local, standalone, Mesos or Yarn
    
    See http://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/submitting-applications.html
    for more information
    """

    def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
        command = []
        if value and isinstance(value, dict):
            for prop, val in value.items():
                command += [name, '"{0}={1}"'.format(prop, val)]
        return command
``` 

In this corrected version, the loop variable inside the for loop is renamed to `val` to avoid conflicts with the input parameter. This modification ensures that the original `value` dictionary is not modified and the function behaves as expected.
