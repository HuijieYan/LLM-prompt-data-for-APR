### Explanation
The bug in the `_dict_arg` function arises from reusing the variable name `value` in the `for` loop to iterate over the dictionary items. This leads to overwriting the original `value` variable, which causes incorrect values to be included in the `command` list. As a result, the function does not correctly generate the command list for the given dictionary input.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to avoid overwriting the original `value` variable with the loop iteration variable. One way to achieve this is by using a different variable name for the loop iteration. 

### Corrected Version of the Function

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, prop_value in value.items():  # Use a different variable name, like prop_value, for the loop iteration
            command.append(name)
            command.append('"{0}={1}"'.format(prop, prop_value))
    return command
```

By using `prop_value` in the loop instead of `value`, we ensure that the original `value` variable is retained and the correct key-value pairs are added to the `command` list. This corrected version should now properly generate the command list based on the input dictionary.
