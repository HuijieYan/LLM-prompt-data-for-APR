### Explanation:
The bug in the `_dict_arg` function lies in the fact that the loop variable name `value` is being used twice - once as an input parameter and again as a loop variable. This leads to overwriting the original `value` dictionary with the inner loop variable `value`, causing unexpected behavior.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the loop variable in the for loop does not have the same name as the input parameter. This can be achieved by changing the name of the loop variable to something different.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():  # changed the name of the loop variable
            command += [name, '"{0}={1}"'.format(prop, val)]
    return command
``` 

By changing the loop variable name to `val`, we no longer overwrite the original `value` variable, fixing the bug in the function.
