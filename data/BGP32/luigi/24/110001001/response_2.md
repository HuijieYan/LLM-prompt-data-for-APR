### Explanation of the bug
The bug in the `_dict_arg` function lies in the fact that it uses the same variable `value` to loop through the dictionary keys and values inside the `value` input parameter. This causes an unintended reassignment of `value` within the loop, leading to incorrect behavior when constructing the `command` list.

### Strategy for fixing the bug
To fix this bug, we should avoid using the same variable name `value` for both the input parameter and the loop iteration variable. By renaming the loop iteration variable to something else, we can prevent the unintended reassignment issue.

### Corrected version of the function

```python
class SparkSubmitTask(luigi.Task):
    def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
        command = []
        if value and isinstance(value, dict):
            for prop, val in value.items():  # Renamed variable from value to val
                command += [name, '"{0}={1}"'.format(prop, val)]
        return command
```

By making this change, the function should now correctly construct the `command` list without modifying the original `value` input parameter.
