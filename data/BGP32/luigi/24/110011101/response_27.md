### Bug Explanation
The bug in the `_dict_arg` function stems from the fact that it improperly handles dictionary values when constructing the command list. In the buggy function implementation, if the value is a dictionary, it iterates through the items of the dictionary and adds them to the command list using string formatting. However, it incorrectly wraps the property values in double quotes, leading to discrepancies in the generated command list compared to the expected output.

For example, when processing a dictionary like `{'Prop': 'Value'}`, the function currently produces `['--conf', '"Prop=Value"']` instead of the expected `['--conf', 'Prop=Value']`.

Due to this incorrect handling, the test cases fail as they compare against the expected command list without the unnecessary double quotes.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, the function `_dict_arg` needs to be modified to ensure that the property values are not enclosed in double quotes when adding them to the command list.

The revised implementation should construct the command list in a way that directly includes the property name and value without additional characters like double quotes.

### Corrected Version

```python
class SparkSubmitTask(luigi.Task):

    def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
        command = []
        if value and isinstance(value, dict):
            for prop, val in value.items():
                command += [name, '{0}={1}'.format(prop, val)]
        return command
```

In the corrected version, the function now properly formats the property key-value pairs by directly concatenating the property name and value without unnecessary quotes. This modification ensures that the generated command list aligns with the expected output, resolving the bug.
