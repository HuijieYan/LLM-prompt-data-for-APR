The bug in the `_dict_arg` function arises from incorrectly handling dictionary values when constructing the command list. The bug includes adding unnecessary quotes around the property value when forming the command list items.

### Cause of the Bug:
In both failing cases, the function is creating command list items by enclosing the property value in double quotes (`" "`), causing the behavior that leads to the failure in the tests. The tests expect the property values to be included without double quotes, resulting in a mismatch between the expected and actual command list items.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that when constructing the command list items, the property value should not be enclosed within double quotes. This adjustment will align the constructed command list with the expected values in the failing tests.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, "{0}={1}".format(prop, val)]
    return command
```

By making this change to the `_dict_arg` function, it will correctly construct the command list items without enclosing the property values in double quotes, addressing the issue observed in the failing tests.
