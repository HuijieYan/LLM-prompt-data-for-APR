### Bug Explanation
The bug in the provided function `_dict_arg` arises from how the dictionary values are handled. The function is intended to iterate over the key-value pairs in the input dictionary and construct a list of command line arguments based on those pairs. However, the bug occurs when constructing these arguments as strings.

The bug specifically involves adding quotes around the property and value in the command list. This is not necessary and leads to an incorrect format when comparing the expected and actual output in the tests. The quotes should not be present in the final output.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to adjust how the command list is constructed. Instead of adding quotes around the property and value when constructing the command list, we should directly append the property and value without quotes. This will ensure that the output matches the expected format and the tests pass successfully.

### Corrected Version of the Function
```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, '{0}={1}'.format(prop, val)]
    return command
```

By removing the unnecessary quotes around `{0}={1}` in the format string, the corrected version of the function will construct the command list correctly without the extra quotes. This change ensures that the output matches the expected format, allowing the tests to pass successfully.
