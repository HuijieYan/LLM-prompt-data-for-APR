The bug in the `_dict_arg` function is caused by mistakenly adding double quotes around the values in the command list. This leads to a mismatch in the expected and actual values during the tests, resulting in assertion errors. To fix this bug, we need to remove the unnecessary double quotes when constructing the command list.

Here is the corrected version of the `_dict_arg` function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, '{0}={1}'.format(prop, val)]
    return command
```

By making this change, the function will construct the command list without enclosing the values in double quotes, matching the expected values in the failing tests. This correction ensures that the function behaves as intended and passes the failing test cases.
