### Explanation:
The bug in the `_dict_arg` function is caused by surrounding the value of each property with double quotes (`"`) when constructing the `command` list. This causes a mismatch between the expected command list and the actual one, resulting in failed assert statements.

### Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to remove the double quotes from around the values of properties when adding them to the `command` list inside the loop.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, '{0}={1}'.format(prop, val)]
    return command
``` 

By removing the double quotes, the corrected function should now construct the command list as a list of strings without extra quotes, which matches the expected output for the failing tests.
