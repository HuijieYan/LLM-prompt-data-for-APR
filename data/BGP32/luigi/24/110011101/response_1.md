### Bug Explanation:
The bug arises from the `_dict_arg` function incorrectly handling the dictionary values passed to it. The function is creating a command list by iterating over the key-value pairs of the input dictionary and adding them as formatted strings with double quotes. This results in the incorrect formatting of values in the command list causing the test cases to fail when comparing the expected and actual command lists.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to update the `_dict_arg` function to correctly format the key-value pairs from the dictionary without enclosing the values in double quotes. By ensuring that the values are added directly without quotes, we can align the behavior with the expected command list in the test cases.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, '{0}={1}'.format(prop, val)]
    return command
```

By making this change, the function will now correctly build the command list with the key-value pairs formatted without unnecessary quotes. This will align the output of the function with the expected command lists in the failing test cases, resolving the issue.
