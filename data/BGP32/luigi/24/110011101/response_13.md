### Bug Explanation
The bug in the `_dict_arg` function stems from incorrectly handling the values for the dictionary provided as an input. The current implementation adds double quotes around the property and value pairs within the dictionary. This is not necessary and causes the tests to fail as the expected values don't include these double quotes.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug
To fix the bug, remove the double quotes from around the property and value pairs in the dictionary processing logic. This will align the output format with the expected values and pass the failing tests.

### Corrected Version of the Function
```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, "{0}={1}".format(prop, val)]
    return command
```

By making this change, the function will correctly format the property-value pairs without unnecessary double quotes, matching the expected values and passing the failing tests.
