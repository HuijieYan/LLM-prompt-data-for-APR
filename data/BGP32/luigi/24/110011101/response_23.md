### Identified Bug
The bug in the `_dict_arg` function lies in the way it handles dictionary values when constructing the `command` list. Instead of directly appending the value of the dictionary, it adds extra double quotes around the property and value, leading to a mismatch in the expected and actual output.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to remove the unnecessary double quotes around the property and value when constructing the command list.

### Corrected Version of the Function
```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():  # Changed variable name here to prevent overwriting
            command += [name, '{0}={1}'.format(prop, val)]  # Removed double quotes here
    return command
``` 

Applying this fix should resolve the issue of mismatch between expected and actual outputs in the failing tests.
