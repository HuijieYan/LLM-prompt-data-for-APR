### Bug Explanation
The bug in the `_dict_arg` function arises from how it handles dictionary values. The function incorrectly adds double quotes around the property values in the command list when creating key-value pairs from the dictionary. This results in a mismatch between the actual command list and the expected command list, causing the test cases to fail.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix this bug, we need to modify the logic in the `_dict_arg` function to correctly format the key-value pairs from the dictionary without adding unnecessary double quotes around the property values. By making this adjustment, the function should construct the command list accurately according to the expected format.

### Corrected Version of the Function
```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():  # Change variable name from value to val
            command += [name, '{0}={1}'.format(prop, val)]  # Remove unnecessary double quotes in formatting
    return command
```

By making these changes, the corrected function should now correctly construct the command list without adding unnecessary double quotes around the values, which should align with the expected output and pass the failing tests.
