### Analysis
1. The `self._dict_arg` function takes a `name` and a `value` as input. It is supposed to handle dictionary values by converting them to a list of command arguments. The bug seems to stem from the way the dictionary key-value pairs are handled.
   
2. The function constructs the `command` list by iterating through the key-value pairs of the input dictionary but includes the key-value pairs in a specific format that is causing the assertion errors in the tests.
   
3. In Case 1, the input dictionary value `'Prop': 'Value'` is being incorrectly formatted as `'"Prop=Value"'`. This formatting is not what is expected based on the failing test output. The correct format should be `'Prop=Value'`.
   
4. In Case 2, the input dictionary value `'prop1': 'val1'` is similarly being incorrectly formatted as `'"prop1=val1"'`, where the double quotes around the value are causing the failure. The expected format should be `prop1=val1`.
   
5. The fix involves removing the double quotes around the value when constructing the command list.

### Corrected Code

```python
class SparkSubmitTask(luigi.Task):
    """
    Template task for running a Spark job
    
    Supports running jobs on Spark local, standalone, Mesos or Yarn
    
    See http://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/submitting-applications.html
    for more information
    """
  
    def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
        command = []
        if value and isinstance(value, dict):
            for prop, val in value.items():  # Changed variable name to avoid conflicts
                command += [name, '{0}={1}'.format(prop, val)]  # Removed unnecessary double quotes
        return command
```

By making the suggested change in the loop iterating over the dictionary items, the corrected function should now correctly format the key-value pairs in the expected format. This should resolve the assertion errors in the failing test cases.
