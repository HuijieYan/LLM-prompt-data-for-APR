### Suggested Strategy for Fixing the Bug
The bug exists in the `_dict_arg` function where it incorrectly formats the dictionary values as strings with double quotes. To fix the bug, we need to remove the unnecessary double quotes around the dictionary values.

### Corrected Version of the `_dict_arg` function
```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, "{0}={1}".format(prop, val)]
    return command
``` 

By making this change, the function will correctly format the dictionary values ('Prop=Value') without the unnecessary double quotes, and the tests should pass as expected.
