### Explanation:
In the `_dict_arg` function, the buggy code is adding quotes around the property value while generating the command list. This results in a discrepancy between the actual output list and the expected output list in the failing tests.

The function is currently generating the command list as `['name', '"prop=value"']` instead of `['name', 'prop=value']`, causing the assertion errors in the failing tests because the expected list does not contain the extra quotes.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, remove the unnecessary quotes around the property value when constructing the command list inside the `_dict_arg` function.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, value in value.items():
            command += [name, '{0}={1}'.format(prop, value)]
    return command
```

By removing the extra quotes, the corrected function will generate the command list in the format expected by the failing tests, resolving the assertion errors.
