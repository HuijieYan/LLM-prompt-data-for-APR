### Bug Explanation
The bug in the `_dict_arg` function arises from the fact that the values in the dictionary are wrapped in double-quotes when constructing the command list. This causes a mismatch when comparing the command list in the test cases, leading to assertion errors.

### Fix Strategy
To fix this bug, we need to remove the unnecessary double-quotes surrounding the property-value pairs when constructing the command list.

### Corrected Version of the Function
```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, '{0}={1}'.format(prop, val)]
    return command
```

By updating the function as shown above, we ensure that the property-value pairs are added to the command list without any additional formatting, resolving the mismatch in the test cases.
