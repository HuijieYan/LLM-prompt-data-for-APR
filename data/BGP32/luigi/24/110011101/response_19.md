The bug in the `_dict_arg` function arises from the fact that it incorrectly includes double quotes around the property-value pairs when constructing the command list. This error causes the failing tests to compare against the expected values that do not contain double quotes for property-value pairs.

To fix this bug, the function should remove the unnecessary double quotes when constructing the command list.

Here is the corrected version of the `_dict_arg` function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, '{0}={1}'.format(prop, val)]
    return command
```

By removing the double quotes around the property-value pairs in the command list, the function now correctly constructs the command list without unnecessary characters.

This correction should resolve the failing tests and align the output with the expected values in all test cases.
