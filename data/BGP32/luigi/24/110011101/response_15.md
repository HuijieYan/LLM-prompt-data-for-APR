### Bug Explanation
The bug in the `_dict_arg` function is related to how the dictionary values are formatted when constructing the command list. The current implementation adds extra quotes around the property value, leading to a mismatch with the expected value in the test cases. The representation of the dictionary key-value pairs within the command list is incorrect.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to remove the unnecessary double quotes surrounding the property values in the command list when constructing it from the dictionary. By directly formatting the key and value without additional quotes, we can ensure that the command list matches the expected values.

### Corrected Version of the Function
```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, "{0}={1}".format(prop, val)]  # Properly format key-value pair without extra quotes
    return command
``` 

By making the above correction in the ` _dict_arg` function, the function should now behave as expected and pass the failing tests.
