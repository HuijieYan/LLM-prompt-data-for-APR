### Bug Explanation
The bug in the `_dict_arg` function arises from the fact that when adding elements to the `command` list, the values are being enclosed in double quotes, which leads to a mismatch with the expected values in the tests. For example, instead of adding `'Prop=Value'`, the function adds `'"Prop=Value"'`. This discrepancy in the formatting of the values causes the assertion errors in the tests.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to remove the unnecessary double quotes that are being added around the values when constructing the command list. By ensuring that the values are added directly without quotes, the function will generate the command list in the expected format, resolving the failing tests.

### Corrected Version of the Function
```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, '{0}={1}'.format(prop, val)]
    return command
```

By using this corrected version of the function, the values will be added to the command list without surrounding double quotes, aligning with the expected format in the tests.
