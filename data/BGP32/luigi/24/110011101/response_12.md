The issue in the buggy function arises from incorrectly formatting the dictionary key-value pairs when constructing the command list. The current implementation wraps the values in double quotes within the command list, leading to a mismatch in comparison during the tests.

To fix this issue, we should modify the `_dict_arg` function to construct the command list without the unnecessary double quotes around the property values.

Here is the corrected version of the `_dict_arg` function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, '{0}={1}'.format(prop, val)]
    return command
```

This version removes the double quotes from around the property values, ensuring that the command list matches the expected values during the test execution. This correction aligns with the expected behavior described in the analysis.
