### Bug Explanation
The bug in the `_dict_arg` function arises from how it handles adding key-value pairs to the `command` list. The function currently wraps each value in double quotes, even though values are expected to be without double quotes. This results in extra quotes appearing in the command list, causing the test assertions to fail.

### Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to remove the unnecessary double quotes around the values being added to the `command` list. This can be achieved by simply formatting the string without the extra quotes.

### Corrected Version of the Function
```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, '{0}={1}'.format(prop, val)]
    return command
``` 

With this correction, the function will now correctly format the key-value pairs without unnecessary double quotes, aligning the output with the expected values provided.
