### Bug Fix
The bug in the `_dict_arg` function is caused by enclosing the `value` part of the key-value pair from the dictionary in double quotes. This results in an incorrect format of the final command list. To fix this, we need to remove the double quotes around the value part of the key-value pair.

### Corrected Version of the `_dict_arg` function
```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, '{0}={1}'.format(prop, val)]
    return command
```

With this correction, the `_dict_arg` function will correctly construct the command list with key-value pairs in the expected format, leading to passing test cases and satisfying the expected input/output values.
