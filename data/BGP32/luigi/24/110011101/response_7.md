### Bug Explanation
The bug in the `_dict_arg` function is related to how it handles the dictionary values when constructing the `command` list. In the buggy implementation, it surrounds the property value with double quotes, which is unnecessary and leads to a mismatch with the expected values.

In both cases provided, the issue arises when the function constructs the `command` list. The expected values do not contain the unnecessary double quotes around the property value, causing the assertion errors.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, the function `_dict_arg` should not include double quotes around the property value when constructing the `command` list. This adjustment will align the function's behavior with the expected output values and resolve the failing test cases.

### Corrected Version of the Function
```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, prop_value in value.items():
            command += [name, '{0}={1}'.format(prop, prop_value)]
    return command
``` 

This corrected version of the `_dict_arg` function removes the unnecessary double quotes around the property value, ensuring that the constructed `command` list matches the expected values. This revision should now pass the failing test cases provided.
