The bug in the `_dict_arg` function arises from the fact that when constructing the command list, the value for each property in the dictionary is being enclosed in double quotes even if it is not necessary. This results in a mismatch when comparing the expected output with the actual output in the failing tests.

To fix this issue, we need to remove the unnecessary double quotes around the property values before appending them to the `command` list.

Here is the corrected version of the `_dict_arg` function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, '{0}={1}'.format(prop, val)]
    return command
```

By modifying the string formatting in the `'{0}={1}'.format(prop, val)` part of the code, we prevent the unnecessary double quotes from being added to the property values. This correction aligns the output of the function with the expected values in the failing tests.
