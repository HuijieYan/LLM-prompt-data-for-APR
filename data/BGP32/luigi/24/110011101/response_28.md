The bug in the `_dict_arg` function arises from incorrectly formatting the dictionary values when generating the command list. The function is currently adding double quotes around the property values, leading to a mismatch in the expected and actual output. To fix this bug, we need to remove the double quotes from around the property values when constructing the command list.

Here is the corrected version of the `_dict_arg` function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, prop_value in value.items():
            command += [name, '{0}={1}'.format(prop, prop_value)]  # Remove double quotes from around prop_value
    return command
```

By removing the double quotes in the format function, the corrected function will properly format the dictionary values without extra quotes. This change will ensure that the generated command list matches the expected values, resolving the test failures.
