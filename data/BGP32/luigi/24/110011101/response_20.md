## Bug Explanation
The bug in the `_dict_arg` function lies in how it handles the values of dictionary items. When adding the key-value pairs to the `command` list, it encloses the values in double quotes (") which is causing the test failures. The test cases expect the values in the command list without quotes, whereas the buggy function adds quotes around the values.

## Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, the function `_dict_arg` should append the key and value directly to the `command` list without enclosing the value in quotes. This will align with the expected values in the test cases and resolve the assertion errors.

## Corrected Code
```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: luigi/contrib/spark.py

# The declaration of the class containing the buggy function
class SparkSubmitTask(luigi.Task):
    """
    Template task for running a Spark job
    
    Supports running jobs on Spark local, standalone, Mesos or Yarn
    
    See http://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/submitting-applications.html
    for more information
    """




    # this is the buggy function you need to fix
    def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
        command = []
        if value and isinstance(value, dict):
            for prop, val in value.items():
                command += [name, '{0}={1}'.format(prop, val)]
        return command
``` 

By removing the double quotes around the values when adding them to the `command` list, the corrected version of the function aligns with the expected input/output values of the failing test cases. This modification should fix the bug and make the function behave as intended.
