### Buggy Function Explanation
The `_dict_arg` function is designed to convert a dictionary into a list of command arguments. However, the bug lies in how the function handles the values in the dictionary. It incorrectly adds double quotes around the value when constructing the command list. This behavior is causing the test cases to fail as they do not expect the value to be enclosed in quotes.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, the function should construct the command list without adding double quotes around the values. This can be achieved by directly appending the key and value pairs as they are without any additional formatting.

### Corrected Function
```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, '{0}={1}'.format(prop, val)]
    return command
``` 

In this corrected version, the function constructs the command list by directly appending the key and value pairs without enclosing the value in quotes. This change ensures that the function behaves as expected and passes the failing tests.
