The bug in the given function `_dict_arg` is that it reuses the variable name `value` within the loop, causing unexpected behavior when trying to access the original `value` passed to the function. This results in incorrect building of the `command` list.

To fix this bug, we should use a different variable name within the loop to avoid overwriting the original `value` parameter.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, '"{0}={1}"'.format(prop, val)]
    return command
```

By using `val` as a variable name within the loop instead of `value`, we ensure that the original `value` passed to the function is not overwritten.

This corrected version should now satisfy the expected input/output cases provided.
