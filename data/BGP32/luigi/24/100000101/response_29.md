The bug in the provided function `_dict_arg` is due to the variable name conflict between the loop iteration variable `value` and the input parameter `value`. This causes the input parameter value to be overwritten within the loop, leading to incorrect output.

To fix the bug, we need to use a different variable name in the loop to avoid conflicts with the input parameter `value`.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for key, val in value.items():
            command += [name, '"{0}={1}"'.format(key, val)]
    return command
```

This corrected version ensures that the input parameter `value` remains unchanged and uses `key` and `val` as loop variables to properly construct the command list.
