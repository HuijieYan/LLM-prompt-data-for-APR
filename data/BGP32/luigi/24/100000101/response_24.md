### Explanation of the Bug
The bug in the `_dict_arg` function is that the function is incorrectly reusing the variable name `value` in the loop that iterates over the dictionary items. As a result, the initial `value` parameter gets overwritten, causing unexpected behavior and incorrect output.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to rename the variable used in the loop to avoid overwriting the initial `value` parameter. This will ensure that the function correctly constructs the `command` list without modifying the input parameters.

### Corrected Version of the Function
```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, '"{0}={1}"'.format(prop, val)]
    return command
``` 

By renaming the variable from `value` to `val` in the loop, we can prevent overwriting the initial `value` parameter and ensure that the function constructs the `command` list correctly. This corrected version of the function should now produce the expected output for both test cases provided.
