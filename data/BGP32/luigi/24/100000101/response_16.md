The bug in the provided function is that it reuses the variable name `value` in the for loop to iterate over the dictionary items, which leads to overwriting the value from the function parameter. This causes incorrect output in the resulting command list.

To fix the bug, we can simply rename the loop variable from `value` to something else, such as `val`.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, '"{0}={1}"'.format(prop, val)]
    return command
```

This corrected version ensures that the values from the input dictionary are correctly added to the command list without being overwritten by the loop variable. The function should now meet the expected input/output values for the provided test cases.
