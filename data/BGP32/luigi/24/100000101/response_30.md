The bug in the `_dict_arg` function lies in the reusing of the variable name `value` for both the input dictionary and the individual key-value pairs inside the loop. This leads to incorrect command generation and unexpected behavior.

To fix this bug, we should use a separate variable to store the individual key-value pair when iterating over the dictionary. Below is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, '"{0}={1}"'.format(prop, val)]
    return command
```

Now, the function correctly captures the individual key-value pairs in the dictionary without overwriting variables. It will generate the expected command list based on the input dictionary.
