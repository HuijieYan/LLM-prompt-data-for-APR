The bug in the provided function is caused by the fact that the loop variable `value` is being overwritten within the loop, leading to incorrect values being appended to the `command` list. 

A solution to this bug would be to use a different variable name for the loop variable to avoid overwriting the function argument `value`. 

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, '"{0}={1}"'.format(prop, val)]
    return command
```

This corrected version ensures that the original `value` remains unchanged while iterating through the dictionary items.
