The bug in the provided function is that it overwrites the variable name `value` in the loop, causing unexpected behavior. The variable `value` is reused for the inner loop, which leads to incorrect output.

To fix this bug, we should use a different variable name for the inner loop to avoid conflict with the outer loop variable. 

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command.append(name)
            command.append(f"{prop}={val}")
    return command
```

This corrected version uses `val` as the variable name in the inner loop to prevent conflicts. It will generate the correct output for the given input cases.
