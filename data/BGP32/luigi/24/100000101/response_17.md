The bug in the provided function lies in the reusing of the variable name "value" within the for loop, which overwrites the original value of the function parameter "value". This causes incorrect values to be appended to the `command` list.

To fix this bug, we need to use a different variable name in the for loop to avoid overwriting the original "value" parameter. Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, '{0}={1}'.format(prop, val)]
    return command
```

This corrected version uses `val` as a separate variable name to store the values from the dictionary, preventing any overwrite of the original `value` parameter.

This corrected function should now produce the expected output for both cases provided.
