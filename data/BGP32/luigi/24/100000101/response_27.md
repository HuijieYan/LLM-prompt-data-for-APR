The bug in the function `_dict_arg` lies in the redeclaration of the variable `value` within the for loop. This causes the original `value` parameter to be overwritten, resulting in incorrect output.

To fix this bug, we can simply use a different variable name inside the loop to avoid overwriting the original `value` parameter.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, prop_value in value.items():
            command += [name, '"{0}={1}"'.format(prop, prop_value)]
    return command
```

With this correction, the function should now produce the expected output for the given test cases.
