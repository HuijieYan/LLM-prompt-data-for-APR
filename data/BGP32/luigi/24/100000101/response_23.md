The bug in the function `_dict_arg` lies in reusing the variable name `value` within the loop, which leads to unintended behavior. The initial `value` parameter is overwritten, causing incorrect results. To fix this, we should use a different variable name inside the loop to avoid the conflict.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for key, val in value.items():
            command += [name, '"{0}={1}"'.format(key, val)]
    return command
```

With this correction, the function should now work correctly for the expected input/output values provided in the test cases.
