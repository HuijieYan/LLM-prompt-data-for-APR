1. Analyzing the buggy function:
The function `_dict_arg` takes two parameters `name` and `value`, where `value` is expected to be a dictionary. It then iterates over the key-value pairs in the dictionary and constructs a list `command` with the format `[name, 'prop=value']`. The bug seems to be in the way the key and value are formatted when adding them to the `command` list.

2. Potential error locations:
The bug may lie in how the key-value pairs are being concatenated to the `command` list inside the loop.

3. Cause of the bug:
The bug seems to stem from the way the key and value are being formatted in the line `command += [name, '"{0}={1}"'.format(prop, value)]`. The formatting is incorrect and is causing issues in generating the expected output.

4. Strategy for fixing the bug:
To fix the bug, we need to correct how the key and value are formatted and added to the `command` list inside the loop. We should remove the unnecessary double quotes around the formatted key-value pair.

5. Corrected version of the function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, '{0}={1}'.format(prop, val)]
    return command
```

With this corrected version, the function should now correctly construct the `command` list with the expected format `[name, 'prop=value']`.
