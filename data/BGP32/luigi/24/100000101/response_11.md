The bug in the provided function is that the variable name used in the loop to store property names gets overridden by the function parameter `name`. This causes unexpected behavior and incorrect output.

To fix this bug, we can simply rename the loop variable from `value` to something else to avoid the conflict with the function parameter. 

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, '"{0}={1}"'.format(prop, val)]
    return command
```

This corrected version ensures that the loop variable does not conflict with the function parameters and provides the expected output for the given test cases.
