### Bug Analysis and Explanation:
The bug in the `_dict_arg` function is caused by reusing the variable name `value` in the loop that iterates over the dictionary passed as an argument. This causes the original `value` parameter to be overwritten, resulting in incorrect value assignments to the `command` list.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to use a different variable name for the loop variable inside the loop that iterates over the dictionary. By doing this, we can prevent overwriting the original `value` parameter and correctly construct the `command` list.

### Corrected Function:
```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, '{}={}'.format(prop, val)]
    return command
```
