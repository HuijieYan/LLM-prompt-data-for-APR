The bug in the provided function is caused by reusing the variable name "value" within the for loop. This causes a conflict with the input parameter "value" and results in incorrect output.

To fix this bug, we need to use a different variable name for the inner loop value in the for loop. 

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items(): # change the inner loop variable name to val
            command += [name, '"{0}={1}"'.format(prop, val)]
    return command
```

With this correction, the function should now produce the correct output for the given input cases.
