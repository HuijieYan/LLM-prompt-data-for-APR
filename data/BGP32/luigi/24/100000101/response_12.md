The bug in the given function is caused by reusing the variable name `value` inside the for loop which overwrites the original `value` input parameter. This results in incorrect values being appended to the `command` list.

To fix this bug, we need to use a different variable name inside the for loop to avoid overwriting the original `value` input parameter.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():  # Use a different variable name here
            command += [name, '"{0}={1}"'.format(prop, val)]
    return command
```

This corrected version ensures that the original `value` input parameter is not overwritten inside the for loop, and the expected output values for the test cases are achieved.
