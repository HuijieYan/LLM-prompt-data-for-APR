The bug in the function is that it overwrites the variable `value` inside the loop, resulting in incorrect output. The inner variable `value` is being used to store key-value pairs from the input dictionary, but it overlaps with the parameter `value` passed into the function.

To fix the bug, we should use a different variable name inside the loop to avoid overwriting the input parameter `value`.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():  # use a different variable name (e.g., val) inside the loop
            command += [name, '"{0}={1}"'.format(prop, val)]
    return command
```

This corrected version should now correctly generate the command list as expected in both provided test cases.
