The bug in the given function lies in the use of the same variable name `value` in the for loop to iterate over the dictionary items and also to store the individual values. This causes the original `value` parameter to be overwritten, leading to incorrect concatenation in the `command` list.

To fix this bug, we need to use a different variable name for the loop iteration to avoid overwriting the original `value` parameter.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, '{0}={1}'.format(prop, val)]
    return command
```

This corrected function uses a different variable `val` inside the loop to store the individual values from the dictionary, ensuring that the original `value` parameter is not overwritten. This will lead to the correct concatenation of key-value pairs in the `command` list.
