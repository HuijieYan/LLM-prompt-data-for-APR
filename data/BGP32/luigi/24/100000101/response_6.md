The bug in the `_dict_arg` function lies in the re-use of the variable name `value` within the loop. This overwrites the original `value` variable, causing unexpected behavior.

To fix this bug, we should use a different variable name within the loop to avoid overwriting the original `value` variable. 

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, '{0}={1}'.format(prop, val)]
    return command
```

This corrected version ensures that the original `value` variable is not overwritten within the loop and produces the expected output for the given test cases.
