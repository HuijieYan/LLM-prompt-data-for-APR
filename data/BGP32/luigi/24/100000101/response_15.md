The bug in the provided function is due to reusing the variable name `value` in the loop. This causes the original `value` parameter to be overwritten and leads to incorrect output.

To fix the bug, we need to use a different variable name inside the loop to avoid overwriting the original `value` parameter.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():  # Use a different variable name (e.g., val)
            command += [name, '"{0}={1}"'.format(prop, val)]
    return command
```

This corrected version should now satisfy the expected input/output values for both cases provided.
