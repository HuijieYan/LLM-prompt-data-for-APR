The bug in the provided function lies in the reassignment of the `value` variable inside the for loop. This causes the function to use the wrong value when generating the command list. To fix this bug, we should use a different variable name inside the for loop to avoid overwriting the `value` parameter.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, '"{0}={1}"'.format(prop, val)]
    return command
```

This corrected version uses `val` as the variable inside the for loop to prevent overwriting the `value` parameter. This way, the function will generate the correct command list according to the input dictionary.
