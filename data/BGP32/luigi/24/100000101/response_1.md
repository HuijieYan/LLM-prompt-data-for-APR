The bug in the `_dict_arg` function is caused due to reusing the variable name `value` in the for loop, which overwrites the input parameter value. To fix this bug, we need to use a different variable name in the for loop to avoid overwriting the input parameter `value`.

### Corrected Version of the Function

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, '"{0}={1}"'.format(prop, val)]
    return command
```

By changing the name of the variable inside the for loop to `val`, we ensure that the input parameter `value` remains unchanged and correctly constructs the `command` list as expected.

The corrected version satisfies the expected input/output values for both cases mentioned.
