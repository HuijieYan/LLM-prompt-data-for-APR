The bug in the provided function is that it is overwriting the variable `value` in the for loop. This causes the function to not behave as expected and leads to incorrect command generation.

To fix the bug, we need to rename the loop variable inside the for loop to something different from the outer variable `value`.

Here is the corrected version of the function:
```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, prop_value in value.items():
            command += [name, '{0}={1}'.format(prop, prop_value)]
    return command
```

With this correction, the function should now work as expected for the given test cases.
