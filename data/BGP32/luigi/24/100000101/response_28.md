The bug in the provided function is that it uses the same variable name `value` to iterate over the input dictionary `value.items()`, which leads to overwriting the original `value`. This results in incorrect command generation.

To fix this bug, we need to use a different variable name for the inner loop, such as `val`, to avoid conflicts with the outer loop variable.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, '"{0}={1}"'.format(prop, val)]
    return command
```

Now, the function should work correctly for the provided test cases:

### Expected case 1
#### Before the return:
- command: `['--conf', 'Prop=Value']`
- value: `'Value'`
- prop: `'Prop'`

### Expected case 2
#### Before the return:
- command: `['--conf', 'prop1=val1']`
- value: `'val1'`
- prop: `'prop1'`
