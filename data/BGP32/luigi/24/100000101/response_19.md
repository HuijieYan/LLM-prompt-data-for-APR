### Analysis
The buggy function `_dict_arg` is designed to take a dictionary `value` and construct a list `command` with key-value pairs formatted as strings. The bug lies in the construction of the string format within the list `command`. The current implementation wrongly includes quotes around the key-value pairs.

### Bug Explanation
The bug stems from the line `command += [name, '"{0}={1}"'.format(prop, value)]`, where the key-value pair is formatted with quotes around it, resulting in incorrectly formatted key-value pairs within the `command` list.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to remove the unnecessary quotes surrounding the key-value pairs when forming the `command` list.

### Corrected Version
```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, '{0}={1}'.format(prop, val)]
    return command
```

The corrected version removes the quotes around the key-value pairs and correctly formats the key-value pairs within the `command` list.
