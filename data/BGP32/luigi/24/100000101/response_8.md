The bug in the provided function is the re-use of the variable name `value` for both the input dictionary and the individual values within the loop. This causes the original `value` to be overwritten and results in incorrect command generation.

To fix this bug, we should use a different variable name for the inner loop value and make sure to append the correct format to the `command` list.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for key, val in value.items():
            command.append([name, '{}={}'.format(key, val)])
    return command
```

This corrected version ensures that each key-value pair in the input dictionary is correctly formatted and added to the `command` list.
