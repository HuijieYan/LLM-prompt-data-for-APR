The bug in the provided function is due to reusing the variable name `value` both as the input parameter name and as the loop variable inside the for loop. This causes a conflict in the variable names and results in incorrect concatenation of values in the `command` list.

To fix this bug, we can rename the loop variable from `value` to something else to avoid conflicts with the input parameter.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for key, val in value.items():
            command += [name, '"{0}={1}"'.format(key, val)]
    return command
```

With this correction, the function should now correctly concatenate the key-value pairs from the input dictionary into the `command` list.

This corrected version satisfies the expected input/output values for both provided test cases.
