### Analysis:
The buggy function `_dict_arg` is intended to convert a dictionary into a list of command arguments, following a specific format. However, the bug lies in the line where the values are being concatenated to the `command` list. Currently, the format `"{0}={1}"` is surrounded by double quotes, which is causing the output format to be incorrect.

### Bug Explanation:
The bug in the function arises from the incorrect formatting of the command arguments being constructed. The use of double quotes around the format `{0}={1}` is unnecessary and leads to an incorrect output format.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to remove the unnecessary double quotes around the format string `"{0}={1}"`.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, "{0}={1}".format(prop, val)]
    return command
```

The corrected version just removes the unnecessary double quotes around the format string. This will result in the desired format of `key=value` for each item in the dictionary.
