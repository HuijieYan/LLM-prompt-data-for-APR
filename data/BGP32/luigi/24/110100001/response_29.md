## Analysis:
The buggy function `_dict_arg` in the `SparkSubmitTask` class is intended to convert a dictionary into a list of command line arguments for running a Spark job. However, there are a couple of issues within the function that need to be addressed:
1. The function is returning an empty list `command` instead of the constructed list of command line arguments.
2. The dynamic use of the variable `value` multiple times within the loop is causing conflicts as it is being overwritten.

## Bug Cause:
The bug causes the function to not correctly construct and return the list of command line arguments from the input dictionary. As a result, the test cases that rely on this function fail due to incorrect construction of command line arguments.

## Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug in the `_dict_arg` function, we need to ensure that the constructed list of command line arguments is correctly populated with the key-value pairs from the input dictionary. Additionally, we need to avoid the conflict caused by reusing the variable name `value` within the loop.

## Corrected Version:
```python
class SparkSubmitTask(luigi.Task):
    """
    Template task for running a Spark job
    
    Supports running jobs on Spark local, standalone, Mesos or Yarn
    
    See http://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/submitting-applications.html
    for more information
    """

    def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
        command = []
        if value and isinstance(value, dict):
            for prop_key, prop_value in value.items():
                command += [name, '"{0}={1}"'.format(prop_key, prop_value)]
        return command
```

By correcting the `_dict_arg` function as shown above, it processes the input dictionary correctly and constructs the list of command line arguments accordingly, fixing the bug and ensuring that the test cases pass.
