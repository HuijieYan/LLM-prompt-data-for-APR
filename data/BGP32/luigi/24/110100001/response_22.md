## Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_dict_arg` is incorrectly constructing the command list based on the input dictionary.
2. The function is appending the `name` parameter with `"="` and the value, which is incorrect as per the usage in the test functions.
3. This bug causes the incorrect command to be generated as observed in the failing test cases.

## Bug Cause:
The bug in the `_dict_arg` function is caused by incorrect formatting of the key-value pairs when constructing the command list. The format used to append the prop and value is incorrect, resulting in failed test cases due to incorrect command construction.

## Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix this bug, we should modify the format of appending key-value pairs to the command list. We should append each key-value pair without the extra `"="`, as required by the test cases.

## Corrected Version:
```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, prop, str(val)]  # append key and value directly, without extra formatting
    return command
```

By updating the `_dict_arg` function as shown above, the bug in the command construction based on the dictionary input should be fixed. This corrected version should pass the failing test cases provided.
