The bug in the `_dict_arg` function is that the variable name `value` is being reassigned within the loop, which causes unexpected behavior when iterating over the dictionary items passed as an argument.

Here is an explanation of the bug:
When the `if value and isinstance(value, dict):` condition is satisfied, the function iterates over the key-value pairs in the dictionary `value` using the loop variable names `prop` and `value`. However, within the loop, the variable `value` is reassigned as the value of the key-value pair. This reassignment causes the loop to lose track of the original `value` dictionary, resulting in incorrect behavior in building the `command` list.

To fix this bug, we need to rename the loop variable `value` to something else to avoid reassigning the original dictionary value. Additionally, we need to ensure that the iteration correctly forms the command list using the key-value pairs in the dictionary.

Here is the corrected version of the `_dict_arg` function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, '"{0}={1}"'.format(prop, val)]
    return command
```

By renaming the loop variable to `val`, we prevent the reassignment conflict and ensure that the correct key-value pairs are used to build the `command` list. This correction will allow the function to correctly process dictionaries passed as arguments and fix the bug.
