### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_dict_arg` is used to convert a dictionary into a list of command line arguments to be passed to the SparkSubmitTask.
2. The buggy function iterates over the key-value pairs in the dictionary to create the command list, but it has a bug in how it constructs the command list.
3. The failing tests show that the generated command list does not match the expected command list, indicating that the bug is related to how the command list is constructed.
4. The bug is likely caused by incorrectly formatting the key-value pairs into command line arguments.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
1. Ensure that each key-value pair from the dictionary is correctly formatted as an argument in the command list.
2. Check for any additional unnecessary characters being added during the formatting process.
3. Ensure that the keys and values are properly enclosed in quotations where necessary.
4. Update the `_dict_arg` function to handle key-value pairs in the dictionary correctly and generate the expected command list.

### Corrected Version of the `_dict_arg` Function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, "{0}={1}".format(prop, val)]
    return command
```

With this corrected version, the function should correctly generate the command list from the dictionary of key-value pairs, ensuring that the command list matches the expected format for the SparkSubmitTask to run successfully.
