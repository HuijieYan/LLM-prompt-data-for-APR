The bug in the `_dict_arg` function is due to the variable name collision where `value` is reused, causing the original `value` to be overwritten. This leads to incorrect command generation in the final return statement.

To fix this bug, we can simply rename the variables used in the loop to avoid variable shadowing.

Here is the corrected version of the `_dict_arg` function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, prop_value in value.items():
            command += [name, '"{0}={1}"'.format(prop, prop_value)]
    return command
```

By renaming the variable from `value` to `prop_value`, we eliminate the variable shadowing issue.

This corrected version should now pass the failing test cases.
