### Analysis:
1. The `SparkSubmitTask` class contains a method `_dict_arg` that is responsible for transforming a dictionary into a list of command line arguments.
2. The method checks if the input `value` is a dictionary and then iterates over the key-value pairs in the dictionary to format them as command line arguments.
3. The method is not correctly handling the case where the input dictionary is empty or `None`, which leads to an empty list being returned instead of gracefully handling this case.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is caused by the fact that the `_dict_arg` method does not handle the scenario where the input dictionary `value` is empty or `None`. This leads to the `command` list being returned as empty when it should handle this case more gracefully.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we should check if the input value is `None` or an empty dictionary at the beginning of the `_dict_arg` method. If the input value is empty or `None`, we can return an empty list or handle this case appropriately based on the functionality requirements.

### Corrected Version:
```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: luigi/contrib/spark.py

# The declaration of the class containing the corrected function
class SparkSubmitTask(luigi.Task):
    """
    Template task for running a Spark job
    
    Supports running jobs on Spark local, standalone, Mesos or Yarn
    
    See http://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/submitting-applications.html
    for more information
    """

    def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
        command = []
        
        if not value or not isinstance(value, dict):
            return command
        
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, '"{0}={1}"'.format(prop, val)]
        
        return command
```

By adding a check at the beginning of the `_dict_arg` method to handle empty or `None` dictionaries, the corrected version of the function should now handle this case more gracefully and pass the failing test cases.
