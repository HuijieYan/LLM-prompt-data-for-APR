The issue in the `_dict_arg` function is that the inner `for` loop is overwriting the `value` variable used as a function argument, causing errors in the construction of the `command` list.

To fix this issue, we can simply use a different variable name in the loop to iterate over the dictionary items. Here is the corrected version of the `_dict_arg` function:

```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: luigi/contrib/spark.py

# The declaration of the class containing the buggy function
class SparkSubmitTask(luigi.Task):
    """
    Template task for running a Spark job

    Supports running jobs on Spark local, standalone, Mesos or Yarn

    See http://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/submitting-applications.html
    for more information
    """

    def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
        command = []
        if value and isinstance(value, dict):
            for prop, val in value.items():
                command += [name, '"{0}={1}"'.format(prop, val)]
        return command
```

By changing the loop variable name from `value` to `val`, we avoid the conflict with the function argument and ensure correct construction of the `command` list.

This corrected version of the function should now pass the failing test cases.
