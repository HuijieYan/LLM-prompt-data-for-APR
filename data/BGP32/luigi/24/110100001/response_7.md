## Analysis:
The buggy function `_dict_arg` in the `SparkSubmitTask` class is supposed to process arguments provided as dictionaries and convert them into a list that can be used in the command line. However, the current implementation is not correctly handling the dictionary keys and values.

## Error Location:
The error is in the way the loop is processing the dictionary items and formatting them into command arguments.

## Cause of the Bug:
The bug is caused by the variable name conflict within the loop where `value` is being reassigned to the dictionary value in each iteration. This results in only one key-value pair being processed correctly while the subsequent pairs are ignored.

## Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to change the name of the loop variable from `value` to something else to avoid conflict with the dictionary value. Additionally, we need to separate the dictionary key and value properly when constructing the command arguments.

## Corrected Version:
```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, '"{0}={1}"'.format(prop, val)]
    return command
``` 

By making these changes, each key-value pair in the dictionary will be processed correctly and added to the command list as expected.
