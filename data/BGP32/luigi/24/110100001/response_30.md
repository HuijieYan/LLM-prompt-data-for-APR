### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_dict_arg()` is supposed to generate a list of arguments based on the input dictionary `value` by formatting key-value pairs and adding them to the list `command`.
2. The function currently has a bug due to reusing the variable name `value` in the loop, which will override the original input value and lead to incorrect arguments being generated.

### Bug Explanation:
The bug in the `_dict_arg()` function causes incorrect argument formatting due to reusing the variable name `value` in the loop. This results in the inner loop using the same variable reference as the outer loop, leading to unexpected behavior and incorrect arguments being generated. This bug causes the failing tests to fail as the generated arguments do not match the expected arguments.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug in the `_dict_arg()` function, it is necessary to use a different variable name in the inner loop to prevent overwriting the original `value` input. By using a different variable name, each key-value pair will be correctly formatted and added to the `command` list without interference from other iterations.

### Corrected Version:
```python
# Corrected version of the buggy function
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, prop_value in value.items():  # Use a different variable name for inner loop
            command += [name, '"{0}={1}"'.format(prop, prop_value)]  # Use prop_value instead of value
    return command
    
```

By correcting the `_dict_arg()` function as shown above, the bug causing the failing tests should be resolved, and the function will correctly generate the list of arguments based on the input dictionary without overwriting the original input.
