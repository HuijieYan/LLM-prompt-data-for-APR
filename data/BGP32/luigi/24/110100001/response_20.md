### Analysis:
1. The `SparkSubmitTask` class is provided as a template task for running a Spark job with various configurations.
2. The `_dict_arg` function within the class is intended to convert dictionary values into a command list for Spark job execution.
3. The bug likely lies in the loop within the `_dict_arg` function where the same variable `value` is being used for both the outer dictionary and the inner values, causing unexpected behavior.
4. The bug causes incorrect formatting of the command list, leading to failures in the test cases provided.
5. The strategy for fixing the bug would involve renaming one of the variables to prevent shadowing and fix the iteration mechanism to correctly append key-value pairs to the command list.

### Corrected Version:
```python
class SparkSubmitTask(luigi.Task):

    def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
        command = []
        if value and isinstance(value, dict):
            for prop, val in value.items():  # Rename the inner value variable to 'val'
                command += [name, '"{0}={1}"'.format(prop, val)]  # Use 'val' instead of 'value'
        return command
```

By making these adjustments, the `_dict_arg` function should now correctly construct the command list for Spark job execution based on the provided dictionary values. This corrected version should address the bug and allow the test cases to pass successfully.
