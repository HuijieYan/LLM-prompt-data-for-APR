The cause of the bug in the `_dict_arg` function is that it is overwriting the `value` variable in the inner loop, leading to incorrect behavior when adding entries to the `command` list. 

To fix the bug, we should use a different variable name in the inner loop to avoid overwriting the `value` parameter passed to the function.

Here is the corrected version of the `_dict_arg` function inside the `SparkSubmitTask` class:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():  # using a different variable name here
            command += [name, '"{0}={1}"'.format(prop, val)]  # using val instead of value
    return command
```

By making this change, the `_dict_arg` function will correctly construct the command list based on the dictionary passed as input.

This corrected version of the function should now pass the failing tests provided.
