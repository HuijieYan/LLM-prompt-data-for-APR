### Analysis:
1. The `SparkSubmitTask` class contains a `_dict_arg` method that is designed to convert a dictionary into a list of command-line arguments.
2. The purpose of this method is to prepare arguments for running a Spark job using the specified dictionary.
3. The bug in the `_dict_arg` method is that it is using the same variable name `value` for the loop variable and the original dictionary. This can lead to overwriting the original dictionary and causing unexpected behavior.
4. The bug is causing the failing test cases because the method is not correctly building the list of command-line arguments from the dictionary values.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug in the `_dict_arg` method, we need to use a different variable for the loop variable inside the loop. This will prevent overwriting the original dictionary and ensure that the command-line argument list is built correctly.

### Corrected Version:
```python
# The corrected version of the buggy function
class SparkSubmitTask(luigi.Task):

    def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
        command = []
        if value and isinstance(value, dict):
            for prop, val in value.items():  # Use 'val' as the loop variable
                command += [name, '"{0}={1}"'.format(prop, val)]
        return command
```

By making this change, the `_dict_arg` method will now correctly build the list of command-line arguments from the dictionary values without overwriting the original dictionary.
