### Analysis:
1. The `_dict_arg` function in the `SparkSubmitTask` class is supposed to generate a command list based on the input dictionary.
2. The function checks if the input value is a dictionary and then iterates over its key-value pairs to construct the command list.
3. The bug might be related to reusing the variable `value` for both the outer dictionary and inner values within the loop.
4. The failing tests indicate that the command list generated by the function is not matching the expected command list.

### Bug Cause:
The bug in the `_dict_arg` function is caused by reusing the variable `value` within the loop. This leads to incorrect construction of the command list which results in failing tests.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we should avoid reusing the same variable name `value` for both the outer value and inner values within the loop. We need to use separate variable names to prevent overwriting the outer dictionary values.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for k, v in value.items():  # using different variable names for outer key-value pair and inner values
            command += [name, '"{0}={1}"'.format(k, v)]
    return command
```

By using separate variable names within the loop (`for k, v in value.items()`), we avoid the bug of overwriting the outer dictionary values and ensure correct construction of the command list.
