## Analyzing the buggy function and its relationship with the buggy class, test code:
1. The buggy function `_dict_arg` is part of the `SparkSubmitTask` class in the `luigi.conrib.spark.py` file.
2. The purpose of the `_dict_arg` function is to convert a dictionary into a list of command arguments for a Spark job submission.
3. The test cases `test_run` and `test_defaults` check if the correct command arguments are being generated when running Spark jobs.

## Identifying potential error locations within the buggy function:
1. The buggy function checks if the input `value` is a dictionary, but the variable name `value` is used again within the loop to represent the values inside the dictionary.
2. The current implementation concatenates the `name` with the formatted string of key-value pairs from the dictionary, but this may not create the intended command structure for Spark job submission.

## Explaining the cause of the bug:
The bug occurs because the loop inside the `_dict_arg` function iterates over the key-value pairs in the dictionary but incorrectly constructs the command list by concatenating the `name` with the formatted string of key-value pairs.

## Suggesting a strategy for fixing the bug:
To fix the bug, we need to separate the variable names properly and construct the command list in a way that follows the correct format for Spark job submission arguments.

## Corrected Version of the `_dict_arg` function:
```python
    def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
        command = []
        if value and isinstance(value, dict):
            for key, val in value.items():
                command += [name, '"{0}={1}"'.format(key, val)]
        return command
```

By updating the variable names from `prop, value` to `key, val`, and ensuring that the correct key and value are used during construction, we can fix the bug in the `_dict_arg` function.
