### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_dict_arg` is supposed to create a command list based on the input dictionary `value`. 
2. The function iterates through the key-value pairs in the dictionary and adds them to the command list in the format `name "prop=value"`.
3. The bug could potentially be caused by incorrectly handling the case when `value` is an empty dictionary.
4. The failing test cases provide examples of how this function is expected to be used in the context of a Spark submit task.
5. The bug seems to be related to the formatting of the command list elements when dealing with dictionaries.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is likely caused by not handling the case when the input dictionary `value` is empty or not a dictionary. This results in an empty `command` list being returned even when `value` is not empty or is not a dictionary.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to make sure that the function properly handles the cases where the input `value` is empty or not a dictionary. We should also ensure that the command elements are formatted correctly when building the command list.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, '"{0}={1}"'.format(prop, val)]
    return command
```

In the corrected version, I have changed the internal variable name from `value` to `val` inside the loop to avoid conflicts. Additionally, I have added a check for the input `value` to be not empty and to be a dictionary before processing its items.

By making these changes, the function should now properly handle different types of input values and build the command list correctly based on the dictionary entries.
