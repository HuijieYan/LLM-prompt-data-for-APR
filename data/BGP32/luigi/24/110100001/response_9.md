The buggy function `_dict_arg` is not correctly handling the values passed to it. It is iterating over the dictionary items and appending the key-value pairs to the `command` list without proper formatting.

The bug arises from the line:
```python
command += [name, '"{0}={1}"'.format(prop, value)]
```

The issue here is that the entire key-value pair is being wrapped within double quotes. This is causing the test cases to fail as the expected command list does not have the key-value pairs enclosed in double quotes.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the way key-value pairs are added to the `command` list. We should only format the key and value and append them individually without wrapping them in double quotes.

Here is the corrected version of the `_dict_arg` function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, "{0}={1}".format(prop, val)]
    return command
```

By making this change, the key-value pairs will be added to the `command` list in the correct format without double quotes. This should fix the bug and make the test cases pass.
