## Analysis:
The buggy function `_dict_arg` in the `SparkSubmitTask` class is designed to take in a dictionary as input, iterate over its items, and build a command list based on the key-value pairs. However, it has a bug where the function overwrites the value variable in the loop, leading to incorrect command generation and causing the failing tests.

## Bug Cause:
The bug in the `_dict_arg` function is caused by using the same variable name (`value`) both for the input parameter and the loop variable within the loop. This causes the loop to overwrite the original dictionary value and results in incorrect command generation.

## Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to differentiate between the input parameter `value` and the loop variable in the for loop. One way to resolve this is by using a different variable name for the loop, such as `prop_value`.

## Updated Code:
```python
# The corrected version of the buggy function
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, prop_value in value.items():
            command += [name, '"{0}={1}"'.format(prop, prop_value)]
    return command
```

By updating the loop variable to `prop_value`, we ensure that the original dictionary value is not overwritten, fixing the bug in the function. This corrected version should now pass the failing tests.
