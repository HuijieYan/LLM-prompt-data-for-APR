## Analysis:
1. The `SparkSubmitTask` class is a template task for running Spark jobs, supporting different configurations like `Spark local`, `Standalone`, `Mesos`, or `Yarn`.
2. The `_dict_arg` function within the `SparkSubmitTask` class is intended to generate command arguments based on a dictionary input.
3. The bug in the `_dict_arg` function seems to be related to the fact that the `value` variable is being overwritten in the loop, causing unexpected behavior when constructing the `command` list.

## Bug:
The bug in the `_dict_arg` function is caused by reusing the variable name `value` in both the loop and the function argument, leading to incorrect argument generation and command construction.

## Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we should avoid reusing the same variable `value` in the loop and the function argument. Instead, we can use different variable names to maintain clarity and consistency when constructing the command list.

## Corrected Version:
```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():  # Use a different variable name
            command += [name, '"{0}={1}"'.format(prop, val)]  # Avoid using the name "value" inside the loop
    return command
```

By using a different variable name (`val`) inside the loop, we ensure that the original `value` passed to the function is not overwritten, leading to correct command construction based on the dictionary input.

This corrected version should resolve the bug and pass the failing test cases provided.
