The buggy function `_dict_arg` is not correctly constructing the command list based on the input dictionary `value`. It is currently overwriting the original `value` variable with the loop variable and causing unexpected behavior.

The bug is causing the `command` list to only contain the last key-value pair from the input dictionary, resulting in missing arguments in the command.

To fix the bug, we need to use a different variable name for the loop variable to prevent overwriting the original `value`. We can also simplify the code by using a list comprehension to construct the command list.

Here is the corrected version of the `_dict_arg` function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        command += [name] + ['"{0}={1}"'.format(prop, val) for prop, val in value.items()]
    return command
```

This corrected version will properly construct the command list based on the input dictionary, ensuring all key-value pairs are included in the final command.
