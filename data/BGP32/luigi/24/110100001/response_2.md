The bug in the `_dict_arg` function is due to re-using the variable name `value` in the loop to iterate through the dictionary keys and values. This causes the original value of `value` to be overwritten, leading to an incorrect command being built.

To fix this bug, we should use a different variable name in the loop to avoid overwriting the original value. Here is the corrected version of the `_dict_arg` function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for key, val in value.items():  # Use different variable names in the loop to avoid overwriting
            command += [name, '"{0}={1}"'.format(key, val)]
    return command
```

By making this change, the function will correctly build the command list with the key-value pairs from the input dictionary. This corrected version should pass the failing tests.
