The bug in the `_dict_arg` function is related to the renaming of the `value` variable inside the loop. It is being used for both the outer value dict and the inner property-value pairs, causing incorrect construction of the `command` list.

To fix this bug, we need to use a different variable name for the inner loop. Here's the corrected version of the `_dict_arg` function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():  # using a different variable name "val" for inner loop
            command += [name, '"{0}={1}"'.format(prop, val)]
    return command
```

By fixing this issue, the function should correctly construct the `command` list with the property-value pairs from the input dictionary.

After applying this fix, the updated function should now pass the failing test cases provided.
