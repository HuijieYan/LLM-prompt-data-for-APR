Upon analyzing the buggy function `_dict_arg` within the `SparkSubmitTask` class, it appears that the bug lies in the logic of generating the command list. The bug is caused by reusing the variable name `value` inside the `for` loop, which overwrites the initial value passed to the function.

To fix this bug, we need to use a different variable name within the loop to prevent overwriting the input `value`. Here is the corrected version of the `_dict_arg` function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():  # Changed variable name from value to val
            command += [name, f'"{prop}={val}"']
    return command
```

By changing the variable name inside the loop to `val`, we ensure that the original `value` is not modified, and the correct key-value pairs are appended to the `command` list.

This corrected version of the function should now pass the failing tests provided.
