1. The buggy function `_dict_arg` within the `SparkSubmitTask` class is intended to accept a dictionary `value`, iterate over its key-value pairs, format them, and append them to a list `command`. However, there are two potential errors in the function:
   a. The function is currently overwriting the `value` variable within the loop, which leads to unexpected behavior.
   b. The function is not properly handling the case when the value is empty or not a dictionary. 

2. The potential error locations in the `_dict_arg` function are:
   a. The line `for prop, value in value.items():` where the loop variable `value` has the same name as the dictionary value parameter. This can lead to an unexpected behavior.
   b. The line `if value and isinstance(value, dict):` where checking if `value` is a dictionary may not be enough to handle all cases.

3. The cause of the bug is that the function `_dict_arg` is incorrectly iterating over key-value pairs of the dictionary input `value` but is using the same variable name for the loop variable and the dictionary value. This leads to the loop variable `value` being different from the function parameter `value`, causing unexpected behavior and incorrect command generation.

4. To fix the bug, we should rename the loop variable in the `_dict_arg` function to avoid shadowing the function parameter `value`. We should also consider additional checks to handle cases where the input value is empty or not a dictionary.

5. Here is the corrected version of the `_dict_arg` function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, prop_value in value.items():
            command += [name, '"{0}={1}"'.format(prop, prop_value)]
    return command
```

By renaming the loop variable to `prop_value` and ensuring proper handling of the input value, the corrected function should now generate the command correctly. This updated version of the function should pass the failing test cases provided.
