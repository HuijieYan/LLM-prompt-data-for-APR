The bug in the `_dict_arg` function is that it modifies the `value` parameter within the loop, causing unexpected behavior. Instead of modifying the `value` parameter (conflicting with the outer `value`), a different variable should be used to store the inner loop value.

To fix this bug, simply change the name of the variable used inside the loop from `value` to a different name (e.g., `inner_value`).

Here is the corrected version of the `_dict_arg` function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, inner_value in value.items():
            command += [name, '"{0}={1}"'.format(prop, inner_value)]
    return command
```

With this change, the function will correctly construct the command list without modifying the original `value` parameter. This correction will ensure that the function behaves as expected and passes the failing test cases.
