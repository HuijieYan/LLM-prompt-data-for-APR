The cause of the bug in the `_dict_arg` function is that it is not handling the key-value pairs properly when constructing the command list. In the buggy function, the variable name `value` is being reused within the loop, causing unexpected behavior. This results in the key-value pairs not being correctly formatted and added to the command list.

To fix this bug, we need to use a different variable name for the inner loop to avoid overwriting the value of the outer loop. Additionally, we should properly handle the case when the `value` is empty or not a dictionary.

Here is the corrected version of the `_dict_arg` function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for key, val in value.items():  # Change variable name to avoid overwriting
            command += [name, '"{0}={1}"'.format(key, val)]
    return command
```

By making these changes, the function will correctly construct the command list with the key-value pairs formatted as expected. This should ensure that the function behaves correctly and passes the failing test cases.
