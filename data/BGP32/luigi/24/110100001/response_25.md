## Analysis:
The `_dict_arg` function in the `SparkSubmitTask` class is supposed to convert a dictionary of properties to a list of command-line arguments. However, there are potential issues with how the function handles the conversion and builds the command. One key issue is that the function uses the same variable name `value` for iterating over the dictionary values, which can lead to unexpected behavior and possibly overwriting the original `value` variable. This can cause incorrect command generation and failures in the test cases.

## Bug Cause:
The bug in the `_dict_arg` function is due to reusing the variable name `value` in the loop where the function iterate through the dictionary items. This reassignment causes the original `value` variable to be lost, leading to incorrect command generation.

## Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix this bug, we need to rename the loop variable to avoid conflicts with the original `value` variable. Additionally, we should ensure that the generated command list includes the key-value pairs from the dictionary correctly.

## Bug-fixed version of the `_dict_arg` function:
```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():  # Rename the variable to 'val'
            command += [name, '"{0}={1}"'.format(prop, val)]  # Use the renamed variable
    return command
``` 

By making this change, the original `value` variable remains unchanged, and the function correctly generates the list of command-line arguments from the dictionary. This fix should ensure that the test cases pass without any issues.
