The bug in the `_dict_arg` function is caused by reusing the variable name `value` for both the dictionary being passed in and the individual key-value pairs within that dictionary. This leads to the inner `value` replacing the outer `value`, resulting in an incorrect output in the `command` list.

To fix this issue, we need to use a different variable name for the inner loop to avoid overwriting the original `value`. Here is the corrected version of the `_dict_arg` function:

```python
# The corrected version of the buggy function
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, prop_value in value.items():  # Change variable name from 'value' to 'prop_value'
            command += [name, '"{0}={1}"'.format(prop, prop_value)]
    return command
```

By changing the variable name in the inner loop to `prop_value`, we ensure that the original `value` passed into the function is preserved and correctly used to construct the command list. This fix should address the bug and make the function work as intended.

After applying this correction, the `_dict_arg` function should now correctly process the dictionary input and generate the expected command list. This will allow the associated test cases `test_run` and `test_defaults` to pass successfully.
