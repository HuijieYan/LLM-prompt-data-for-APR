### Bug Explanation
The bug in the `_dict_arg` function arises from the incorrect handling of dictionary values when constructing the command list. The function is incorrectly adding quotes around key-value pairs in the command list, causing the test cases to fail due to differences in the expected and actual command structures.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to modify the function to correctly format the key-value pairs without additional quotes. This will align the command list structure with the expected output in the test cases.

### Corrected Version of the Function
```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, '{0}={1}'.format(prop, val)]
    return command
```

In the corrected version, the function now formats key-value pairs without unnecessary quotes, ensuring compatibility with the expected command structure in the test cases. This fix should address the bug and allow the test cases to pass successfully.
