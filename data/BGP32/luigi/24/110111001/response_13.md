### Bug Explanation
The bug in the `_dict_arg` function arises from the way the function handles building the command list for dictionary arguments. Specifically, when constructing the command list, the function incorrectly encapsulates the value pairs in double quotes, resulting in a mismatch with the expected format in the failing tests. The function should not enclose the property-value pairs in double quotes, leading to the assertion errors seen in the test cases.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to modify the `_dict_arg` function to correctly format the property-value pairs without encapsulating them in double quotes. By adjusting the construction of the command list, we can ensure that it aligns with the expected format in the failing tests, resolving the assertion errors.

### Corrected Version of the Buggy Function
```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, '{0}={1}'.format(prop, val)]
    return command
```

By modifying the function as shown above, the property-value pairs will be formatted correctly without double quotes, aligning with the expected command list structure in the failing tests. This correction should resolve the assertion errors and make the function behave as intended.
