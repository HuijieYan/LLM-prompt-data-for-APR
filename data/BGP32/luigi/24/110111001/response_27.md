The issue in the provided function `_dict_arg` stems from the way values are handled when constructing the command list. The function incorrectly adds double quotes around the property value within the command list, resulting in a mismatch during the test comparisons.

To fix this bug, we need to eliminate the unnecessary double quotes around the property values. Here's the corrected version of the `_dict_arg` function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, prop_value in value.items():
            command += [name, '{0}={1}'.format(prop, prop_value)]
    return command
```

By removing the double quotes around `{0}={1}`, the function will construct the command list without unnecessary quotes, which should align with the expected results in the tests.

This correction ensures that the command list generated by the function matches the expected command list defined in the test functions, resolving the mismatch and passing the failing tests.
