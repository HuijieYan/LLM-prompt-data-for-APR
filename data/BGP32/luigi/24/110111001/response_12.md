The bug in the `_dict_arg` function arises from incorrectly formatting the dictionary values when constructing the command list. The function currently encloses the dictionary values in double quotes, which causes issues when comparing the expected command list in the test cases.

To fix this bug, the function should format the dictionary key-value pairs without enclosing them in double quotes.

Here is the corrected version of the `_dict_arg` function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, '{0}={1}'.format(prop, val)]
    return command
```

By using `{0}={1}` instead of `"{0}={1}"`, we ensure that the dictionary key-value pairs are correctly formatted in the command list.

This correction should address the formatting issue observed in the failing test cases, allowing the function to generate command lists that match the expected values provided in the tests.
