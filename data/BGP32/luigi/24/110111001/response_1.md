The issue in the buggy function `_dict_arg` is that it incorrectly formats the dictionary values when constructing the command list. It adds extra double quotes around the property values, causing the assertion failures in the test cases due to the mismatch in expected and actual values.

### Bug Cause:
The bug occurs because when iterating over the dictionary items, the function is wrapping the property values in double quotes using `'{0}={1}'`. This leads to the values being enclosed in additional quotes in the final command list, causing a mismatch with the expected values in the tests.

### Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to remove the unnecessary double quotes around the property values when constructing the command list. This way, the command list will align with the expected values in the tests, resolving the assertion failures.

### Corrected Version of the `_dict_arg` function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, '{}={}'.format(prop, val)]
    return command
```

This corrected version of the `_dict_arg` function will properly format the command list by directly concatenating the property and value without adding extra quotes. It will align with the expected values in the tests, thereby fixing the bug.
