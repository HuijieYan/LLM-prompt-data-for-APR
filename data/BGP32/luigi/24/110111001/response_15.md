### Bug Explanation:
The bug in the `_dict_arg` function arises from the incorrect formatting of the key-value pairs when building the command list. The function is currently adding double quotes around the value, which is not necessary and causes a mismatch with the expected format in the test cases.

The test cases are failing because the function is adding unnecessary double quotes around the property-value pairs, leading to a mismatch in the comparison with the expected command list.

### Bug Fix:
To fix the bug, we need to remove the unnecessary double quotes around the property-value pairs when constructing the command list. This will ensure that the output of the function matches the expected format in the test cases.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, value in value.items():
            command += [name, '{0}={1}'.format(prop, value)]
    return command
```

By removing the double quotes around `{0}={1}` in the `format` method, the corrected function will generate the command list without unnecessary quotes, resolving the bug and making the function compatible with the test cases.
