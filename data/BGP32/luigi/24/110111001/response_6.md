### Explanation of the Bugs

The issue in the `_dict_arg` function arises from the way it constructs the command list when the input value is a dictionary. The function iterates over the dictionary items and creates command elements by formatting the key-value pairs. However, it incorrectly includes double quotes around the value in the command list, causing mismatches in the comparison in the test functions.

In the first case, the function builds the command list as `['--conf', '"Prop=Value"']`, where the value should be `Value` without quotes.

In the second case, the function constructs the command list as `['--conf', '"prop1=val1"']`, where the value should be `val1` without quotes.

The root cause of the bug lies in the formatting of the key-value pairs within the command list. The function erroneously treats the value as a string with quotes rather than just the value itself.

### Fix Strategy

To fix the bug, we need to modify the way the function constructs the command list when encountering dictionary values. Instead of including the key-value pairs with quotes around the value, we should construct the command elements with the key and value only. This adjustment will ensure that the command list matches the expected format in the test functions.

### Corrected Version of the Function

Here is the corrected version of the `_dict_arg` function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, '{0}={1}'.format(prop, val)]
    return command
```

With this modification, the function will correctly build the command list without including unnecessary quotes around the values. This corrected version should now pass the failing test cases.
