### Bug Explanation:
The bug in the `_dict_arg` function arises from the incorrect handling of dictionary values when constructing the `command` list. The function incorrectly surrounds the property and value pairs with double quotes, resulting in a mismatch between the expected list structure and the actual structure created.

In Case 1, when the input `value` is `{'Prop': 'Value'}`, the function constructs `['--conf', '"Prop=Value"']` instead of `['--conf', 'Prop=Value']`, causing the test to fail due to the mismatch in the list elements.

Similarly, in Case 2, with input `value` as `{'prop1': 'val1'}`, the function constructs `['--conf', '"prop1=val1"']` instead of `['--conf', 'prop1=val1']`, leading to a failure in the test comparison.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To address the bug, we need to modify the `_dict_arg` function to correctly format the property and value pairs without enclosing them in double quotes. This adjustment will ensure that the constructed `command` list matches the expected structure in the test cases.

### Corrected Version of the `_dict_arg` Function:
```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, prop_value in value.items():
            command += [name, '{0}={1}'.format(prop, prop_value)]
    return command
``` 

By applying this fix, the function will correctly create the list of arguments without unnecessary quotes, aligning with the expected format in the test cases and resolving the failing tests.
