### Bug Explanation
The bug in the `_dict_arg` function arises from the way it constructs the command list from the input dictionary. The original implementation incorrectly adds quotes around the property and value pairs, causing the test cases to fail when comparing the expected command with the actual command.

In Case 1, the input dictionary `{'Prop': 'Value'}` results in adding the property and value as a single string enclosed in double quotes, leading to a mismatch with the expected command format without quotes.

Similarly, in Case 2, the input dictionary `{'prop1': 'val1'}` experiences the same issue where the property and value pair is enclosed in double quotes, causing a mismatch during the comparison.

### Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to modify the `_dict_arg` function to add the property and value pairs without enclosing them in double quotes. This adjustment will align the command format with the expected output in the test cases.

### Corrected Version of the Function
```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command.extend([name, '{0}={1}'.format(prop, val)])
    return command
``` 

By applying the corrected version of the `_dict_arg` function, the property and value pairs will be added to the command list without quotes, resolving the mismatch seen in the failing test cases.
