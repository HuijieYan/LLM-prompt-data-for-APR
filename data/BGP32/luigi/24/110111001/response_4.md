### 3. Explanation of the Bug

The bug in the `_dict_arg` function is caused by the conversion of dictionary values to strings using double quotes (`"`). This conversion leads to a mismatch in the expected list of arguments with the actual list of arguments generated by the function. The failing tests are detecting this discrepancy.

In Case 1, the value `{'Prop': 'Value'}` is converted to `'"Prop=Value"'` instead of `'Prop=Value'`. Similarly, in Case 2, the value `{'prop1': 'val1'}` is converted to `'"prop1=val1"'` instead of `'prop1=val1'`.

This discrepancy in the formatting of dictionary values in the generated command list causes the assertion errors in the tests.

### 4. Fixing the Bug

To fix the bug, we need to adjust how dictionary key-value pairs are converted to strings in the `_dict_arg` function. Instead of encapsulating the key-value pairs in double quotes, we should generate the format without quotes to match the expected format in the tests.

### Corrected Version of the Function

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, '{0}={1}'.format(prop, val)]
    return command
```

With this correction, the generated command list should match the expected list of arguments in the tests, resolving the assertion errors.
