### Bug Explanation:

The bug arises from how the `_dict_arg` function handles dictionary values when constructing the command list. The function incorrectly wraps the property value in quotes in cases where it shouldn't, leading to a mismatch between the expected command list in the test and the actual command list generated by the function.

In Case 1, the input dictionary value is `{'Prop': 'Value'}`. When processing this dictionary, the function adds `'"Prop=Value"'` to the `command` list, which is incorrect. It should add `--conf Prop=Value` without the quotes around `'Prop=Value'`.

In Case 2, the input dictionary value is `{'prop1': 'val1'}`. Similarly, the function adds `'"prop1=val1"'` to the `command` list instead of `--conf prop1=val1`.

### Bug Fix Strategy:

To fix the bug, we need to modify the `_dict_arg` function to correctly construct the command list without unnecessary quotes around the property value when adding it to the list. We should check if the value is a string or a number before deciding whether to wrap it in quotes.

### Corrected Version of the `_dict_arg` Function:

Here is the corrected version of the `_dict_arg` function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, prop_value in value.items():
            command += [name, '{0}={1}'.format(prop, prop_value)]
    return command
```

This corrected version will properly construct the command list without unnecessary quotes, resolving the issue observed in the failing tests.
