The bug in the `_dict_arg` function is caused by incorrectly formatting the dictionary key-value pairs when constructing the command list. It is adding unnecessary double quotes around the property value in the command list, leading to mismatches with the expected command list in the test cases.

To fix this bug, we need to remove the double quotes around the property values when constructing the command list.

Here is the corrected version of the `_dict_arg` function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, prop_value in value.items():
            command += [name, '{0}={1}'.format(prop, prop_value)]
    return command
```

By removing the extra double quotes around the property values, the function will now correctly construct the command list with the key-value pairs from the input dictionary.

This corrected version should pass the failing test cases provided in the question.
