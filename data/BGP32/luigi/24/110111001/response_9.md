### Potential Error Locations:
1. The way the function constructs the command list by adding items like `name`, property name, and property value with incorrect formatting.
2. The use of double quotes around the property value, leading to discrepancies in the expected vs. actual command list.

### Cause of the Bug:
The bug arises due to how the `_dict_arg` function constructs the command list. It adds the property name and value using double quotes around the value. This format differs from the expected format in the tests, causing assertions to fail.

Furthermore, the function does not correctly handle dictionary inputs in generating the command list.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
1. Modify the function to properly parse dictionary inputs and generate the command list items without including unnecessary double quotes.
2. Ensure that the generated command list matches the expected format in the test cases.

### Corrected Version of the Buggy Function:
```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, '{0}={1}'.format(prop, val)]
    return command
```

In this corrected version, we remove the unnecessary double quotes around the property value and adjust the format to match the expected format in the tests.
