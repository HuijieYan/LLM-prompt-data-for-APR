### Bug Explanation
The bug in the `_dict_arg` function is caused by the unnecessary double-quoting of the property=value pair when constructing the command list. In the failing tests, the expected command list elements do not include double-quotes for the property=value pairs, resulting in a mismatch and assertion failure.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to remove the unnecessary double-quoting of the property=value pairs in the command list construction. We should construct the command list by directly adding `prop=value` instead of `"{prop}={value}"`.

### Corrected Version
```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, value in value.items():
            command += [name, '{0}={1}'.format(prop, value)]
    return command
```

With the above correction, the function now constructs the command list correctly without unnecessary double-quoting, ensuring that it aligns with the expected values in the failing tests.
