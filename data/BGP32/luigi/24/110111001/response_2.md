## Bug Analysis
1. The buggy function `_dict_arg` expects a dictionary as input and converts it into a list of command line arguments. The function iterates over the key-value pairs in the dictionary and appends them to the `command` list in the format `name="value"`.
   
2. The bug arises from the fact that the function incorrectly adds double quotes around the property values when constructing the command list. This results in a mismatch when comparing the expected command list in the test functions, leading to assertion errors due to the difference in formatting.

## Bug Explanation
In Case 1, the function incorrectly constructs the command list as `['--conf', '"Prop=Value"']`, where the property value `"Value"` is enclosed in double quotes. Similarly, in Case 2, the command list is created as `['--conf', '"prop1=val1"']` with the property value `"val1"` enclosed in double quotes. This discrepancy in formatting causes the assertion errors in the test functions.

## Bug Fix
To fix the bug, the function `_dict_arg` should construct the command list without enclosing the property values in double quotes. The corrected function will append the properties as `name=value` instead of `name="value"`.

Below is the corrected version of the function `_dict_arg`:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, "{}={}".format(prop, val)]
    return command
```

This modification ensures that the command list is constructed correctly according to the key-value pairs in the input dictionary without unnecessary double quotes.

After applying this fix, the function should generate the command list in the expected format, resolving the assertion errors in the test functions.
