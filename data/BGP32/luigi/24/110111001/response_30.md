**Bug in the buggy function:**

The issue lies in how the `_dict_arg` function processes the dictionary input. It is currently adding the dictionary values to the `command` list within double quotes, which is causing the test cases to fail because the expected output does not contain the values within extra quotes.

**Proposed fix strategy:**

To resolve the bug, the `_dict_arg` function should add the dictionary values without quotes when constructing the `command` list.

**Corrected version of the `_dict_arg` function:**

```python
class SparkSubmitTask(luigi.Task):
    def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
        command = []
        if value and isinstance(value, dict):
            for prop, val in value.items():
                command += [name, '{0}={1}'.format(prop, val)]
        return command
```

By removing the extra quotes around the dictionary values in the `command` list, the corrected version of the function should now pass the failing test cases.
