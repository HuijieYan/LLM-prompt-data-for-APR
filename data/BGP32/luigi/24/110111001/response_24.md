The bug in the `_dict_arg` function arises from the incorrect formatting of key-value pairs in the command list when constructing arguments to be passed. The current implementation adds unnecessary quotes around the value, causing the assertion errors in the test cases.

The correction involves removing the quotes around the value when constructing the command list, this will align with the expected format of the arguments in the test cases.

Here is the corrected version of the `_dict_arg` function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():  # changed from 'value' to 'val' to avoid confusion
            command += [name, '{0}={1}'.format(prop, val)]  # removed unnecessary quotes
    return command
```

By making this adjustment, the function will correctly format the key-value pairs without adding unnecessary quotes. This change should resolve the assertion errors encountered in the failing test cases.
