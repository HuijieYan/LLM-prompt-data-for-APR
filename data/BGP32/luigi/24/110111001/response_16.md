### Bug Analysis:
The buggy function `_dict_arg` is designed to take a name and a value as input, where the value is expected to be a dictionary. It then iterates over the dictionary items, formats them as key-value pairs, and appends them to the `command` list with the provided name. However, the bug lies in how the key-value pairs are formatted before being added to the `command` list. The bug is in the line `command += [name, '"{0}={1}"'.format(prop, value)]`, where it unnecessarily wraps the value in double quotes, leading to an incorrect format.

### Bug Explanation:
1. In Case 1, the input dictionary `value` is `{'Prop': 'Value'}`. When the function iterates over this dictionary, it formats the key-value pair as `'"Prop=Value"'` and appends it to the `command` list. Consequently, `command` becomes `['--conf', '"Prop=Value"']`, which is incorrect.

2. In Case 2, the input dictionary `value` is `{'prop1': 'val1'}`. Similar to Case 1, the function formats the key-value pair as `'"prop1=val1"'` and appends it to the `command` list. As a result, `command` becomes `['--conf', '"prop1=val1"']`, which is incorrect.

The error messages from the failing tests indicate that the expected format is without the unnecessary double quotes around the value. It expects the values to be in the format `'key=value'`, not `'"key=value"'`.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, remove the unnecessary double quotes around the formatted key-value pairs when constructing the command list. This will ensure that the generated command list follows the correct format without additional quoting.

### Corrected Version of the `_dict_arg` function:
```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():  # Changed variable name 'value' to 'val'
            command += [name, "{0}={1}".format(prop, val)]  # Removed unnecessary double quotes
    return command
``` 

By applying this correction, the function will correctly format the key-value pairs without wrapping the values in unnecessary quotes, addressing the bug identified in the failing tests.
