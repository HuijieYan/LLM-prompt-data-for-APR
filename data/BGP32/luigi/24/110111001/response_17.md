### Identified Bug:
The bug in the `_dict_arg` function is related to how the dictionary key and value are concatenated when constructing the command list. The bug is causing the values to be enclosed in double quotes when they shouldn't be, resulting in a mismatch with the expected output in the tests.

### Bug Explanation:
The `_dict_arg` function is supposed to iterate over the key-value pairs in the input dictionary and construct a command list with the format `name key=value`. However, the bug in the function is adding unnecessary double quotes around the values, causing the actual output to differ from the expected output in the tests.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to remove the double quotes around the values when constructing the command list. This will align the output with the expected format in the tests.

### Corrected Version of the `_dict_arg` function:
```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, '{0}={1}'.format(prop, val)]
    return command
```

By removing the unnecessary double quotes when formatting the key-value pairs, the corrected function should now construct the command list in the expected format without causing any mismatches with the test cases.
