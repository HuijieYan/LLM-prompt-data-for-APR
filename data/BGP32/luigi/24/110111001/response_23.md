### Explanation:
The issue in the buggy function `_dict_arg` stems from the fact that the code incorrectly wraps the values in the dictionary with double quotes when constructing the command list. This results in a mismatch between the expected command list and the actual command list when the function is called in the test cases.

In Case 1, the function incorrectly adds double quotes around the property-value pair, leading to the value being enclosed in quotes in the resulting command list. This causes the test to fail because the expected command list does not include the value enclosed in quotes.

In Case 2, a similar problem occurs where the function incorrectly wraps the property-value pair in quotes, causing a mismatch with the expected command list that does not include the quotes.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to modify the `_dict_arg` function to not wrap the property-value pairs in double quotes when constructing the command list. This will ensure that the resulting command list matches the expected format in the test cases.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, '{0}={1}'.format(prop, val)]
    return command
``` 

By removing the double quotes around the `{0}={1}` format in the list concatenation, we ensure that the property-value pairs are added to the command list without any additional characters. This corrected version should now pass the failing tests.
