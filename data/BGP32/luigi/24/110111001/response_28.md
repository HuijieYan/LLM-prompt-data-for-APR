### Analysis and Explanation:
The buggy function `_dict_arg` is intended to take a dictionary `value` and convert it into a list of command arguments to be used in a command execution. The issue arises from the way the function handles the dictionary values. Currently, the function encloses the dictionary key-value pairs in double quotes, resulting in a mismatch when comparing the expected command list with the actual command list in the failing tests.

The error messages in both failing tests indicate that the problem lies in how the function handles dictionary values when creating the command list. The actual command list includes key-value pairs enclosed in double quotes, while the expected command list does not have this formatting. This discrepancy causes the assertion errors.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug in the `_dict_arg` function, we should modify the way key-value pairs are added to the command list. Instead of enclosing each pair in double quotes, we should simply add them as strings without quotes. This adjustment will align the actual command list format with the expected format in the failing tests.

### Corrected Version of the `_dict_arg` function:
```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command.extend([name, '{0}={1}'.format(prop, val)])
    return command
```

The corrected version of the function above should resolve the formatting issue, ensuring that the command list generated from the dictionary values matches the expected format in the failing tests.
