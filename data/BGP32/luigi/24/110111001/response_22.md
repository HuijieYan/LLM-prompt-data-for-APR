### Bug Explanation
The bug in the `_dict_arg` function lies in how the key-value pairs from the input dictionary are being formatted before adding them to the `command` list. In the current implementation, the values are being enclosed in double quotes, which is causing discrepancies in the expected output when comparing with the test cases.

In Case 1, when the input dictionary `{ 'Prop': 'Value' }` is processed with `name='--conf'`, the function returns `['--conf', '"Prop=Value"']` instead of `['--conf', 'Prop=Value']`. The mismatch between the expected and actual output leads to the test failure.

In Case 2, a similar issue occurs with the input dictionary `{ 'prop1': 'val1' }` processed with `name='--conf'`, resulting in `['--conf', '"prop1=val1"']` instead of `['--conf', 'prop1=val1']`, leading to test failure as well.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to remove the double quotes around the formatted key-value pairs in the `command` list. This will ensure that the output matches the expected format and resolves the test failures.

### Corrected Version of the `_dict_arg` Function
```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, '{0}={1}'.format(prop, val)]
    return command
```

By removing the double quotes around `{0}={1}` in the `format` function, the corrected version of the function will correctly format the key-value pairs without unnecessary quotes. This fix should address the issues and make the function behave as expected in the tests.
