### Analysis
The buggy function `_dict_arg` is designed to create a list of command line arguments based on a dictionary input. The issue arises from converting dictionary key-value pairs into strings wrapped in double quotes in the command list. This results in a mismatch between the expected command list and the actual command list generated by the function. The failing tests highlight discrepancies in how the dictionary values are formatted in the command list.

### Bug Explanation
1. In Case 1, the input dictionary is `{'Prop': 'Value'}` with the name `'--conf'`. The function incorrectly adds `'"Prop=Value"'` to the command list instead of `'Prop=Value'`, resulting in an assertion error when compared to the expected command list.
2. In Case 2, the input dictionary is `{'prop1': 'val1'}` with the name `'--conf'`. Similar to Case 1, the function incorrectly adds `'"prop1=val1"'` to the command list instead of `'prop1=val1'`, leading to an assertion error during comparison.

### Solution Strategy
To resolve the bug, we need to ensure that the key-value pairs from the dictionary are formatted correctly in the command list without unnecessary double quotes. By updating the string formatting method, we can fix the bug and align the function's behavior with the expectations in the tests.

### Corrected Version of the Function
```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, '{}={}'.format(prop, val)]
    return command
```

By using `{}` in the format string instead of wrapping the key-value pair in double quotes, the corrected function will generate the command list as expected by the tests. This change ensures that the key-value pairs from the dictionary are added to the command list without unnecessary formatting, fixing the bug in the `_dict_arg` function.
