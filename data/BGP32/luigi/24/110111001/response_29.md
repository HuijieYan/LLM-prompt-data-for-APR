### Explanation of the bug
In the `_dict_arg` function, there is an issue when constructing the command list from the dictionary input. The problem arises from incorrectly adding the items to the `command` list. The function is currently creating strings with key-value pairs inside double quotes, which is leading to incorrect formation in the final command list.

The failing tests indicate that the function is producing incorrect output due to the key-value pairs in the dictionary not being formatted properly for command line arguments. This results in discrepancies when comparing the expected command list with the one generated by the function.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to modify the way key-value pairs are added to the `command` list. Instead of wrapping the pairs in double quotes within the list, we should construct each item as a separate element in the form of `--key value` without quotes. This will ensure that the command list is generated correctly for further processing.

### Corrected Version of the Function
```python
class SparkSubmitTask(luigi.Task):
    """
    Template task for running a Spark job
    
    Supports running jobs on Spark local, standalone, Mesos or Yarn
    
    See http://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/submitting-applications.html
    for more information
    """
    
    def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
        command = []
        if value and isinstance(value, dict):
            for prop, val in value.items():
                command += [name, '--{0}'.format(prop), str(val)]
        return command
```

By making the above changes to the `_dict_arg` function, the key-value pairs will be correctly formatted in the command list, and the corrected version should now produce the expected output for the failing tests.
