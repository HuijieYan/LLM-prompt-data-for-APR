### Explanation of the bug

The bug in the `_dict_arg` function arises from the fact that the function incorrectly formats the dictionary values when creating the command list. 

The function is expected to iterate over the key-value pairs in the input dictionary and construct command arguments to be added to the `command` list. However, the bug occurs when the function tries to add the key-value pair to the command list by incorrectly surrounding the value with double quotes and the key with single quotes. This incorrect formatting results in the lists being compared differing due to the quotation marks around the value.

### Bug Fix Strategy

To fix the bug, the function needs to update the way it constructs the command list by correctly formatting the key-value pairs. Specifically, the function should not add quotation marks around the value and should construct the argument as `'key=value'`.

### Corrected Version of the Function

```python
# The buggy function fixed
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, '{0}={1}'.format(prop, val)]
    return command
```

With the corrected version of the function, the key-value pairs from the input dictionary will be correctly formatted without unnecessary quotation marks. This should resolve the issues observed in the failing tests.
