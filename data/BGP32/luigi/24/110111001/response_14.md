### Analysis
1. The buggy function `_dict_arg` is supposed to construct a command list based on the input dictionary `value`. It iterates over the key-value pairs in the dictionary and adds them to the command list in a specific format.
2. The bug seems to be related to how the key-value pairs from the dictionary are added to the command list in the format `"{key}={value}"`.
3. The failing tests indicate that the values in the command list are not being formatted correctly. The error message shows a mismatch between the expected command list and the actual command list due to incorrect formatting of the key-value pairs.
4. To fix the bug, we need to correct the format of adding key-value pairs to the command list to match the expectations of the test cases.

### Bug Fix Strategy
We need to modify the way key-value pairs are added to the command list to ensure they are formatted correctly without any additional quotation marks around the values.

### Corrected Version
```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, '{0}={1}'.format(prop, val)]
    return command
``` 

By using the `.format()` method without wrapping the value in quotation marks, we ensure that the key-value pairs are correctly formatted in the command list. This corrected version should pass the failing tests.
