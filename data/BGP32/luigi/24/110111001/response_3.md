The bug in the `_dict_arg` function arises from the incorrect handling of dictionary values. The function is adding unnecessary quotes around the key-value pairs when constructing the command list. This leads to a mismatch in the expected and actual command lists, causing the tests to fail.

To fix the bug, we need to remove the additional quotes added around the key-value pairs when constructing the command list.

Here is the corrected version of the `_dict_arg` function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, '{0}={1}'.format(prop, val)]
    return command
```

With this correction, the function should construct the command list correctly without unnecessary quotes around the key-value pairs, and the failing tests should pass.
