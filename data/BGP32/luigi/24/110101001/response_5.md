### Explanation:
The bug in the `_dict_arg` function lies in the fact that it reuses the variable name `value` in the for loop iteration, which overwrites the input `value` causing unexpected behavior. This is evident in the runtime values where the input `value` is lost during the loop processing.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix this bug, we need to use a different variable name for the loop iteration in order to avoid overwriting the original `value` input. By renaming the loop variable, we can prevent the issue of losing the original input value during the loop execution.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():  # renaming variable to val to avoid overwriting input value
            command += [name, '"{0}={1}"'.format(prop, val)]  # using val instead of value
    return command
``` 

By making this change, the `value` input will no longer be overwritten during the loop iteration, and the corrected function should now handle dictionary arguments correctly. This should make the failing tests pass as expected.
