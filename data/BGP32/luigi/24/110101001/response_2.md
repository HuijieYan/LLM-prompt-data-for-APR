### 1. Analyze:
The buggy function `_dict_arg` is meant to construct a list of command arguments based on a dictionary input. The function iterates through the key-value pairs in the dictionary and constructs arguments in the format `name="value"`. However, the current implementation is incorrectly formatting the argument values.

### 2. Potential Error:
The bug likely lies in how the function is constructing the command list by incorrectly formatting the values as `"{0}={1}"`, leading to extra quotes around the values.

### 3. Explanation of the Bug:
The bug is causing extra quotes to be added around the values of the dictionary key-value pairs, resulting in an incorrect command list. In the failing test cases, the expected command list does not match the actual command list due to these extra quotes.

### 4. Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to modify the way the arguments are constructed to remove the unnecessary quotes around the values. This can be achieved by simply using the format `{0}={1}` without the quotes around the values.

### 5. Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, prop_value in value.items():
            command += [name, "{0}={1}".format(prop, prop_value)]
    return command
```

By making this change, the corrected function will correctly construct the command list without the extra quotes around the values, resolving the bug.
