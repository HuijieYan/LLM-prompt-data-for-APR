### Analysis:
The `_dict_arg` function is intended to construct a command list based on the provided dictionary of properties and values. However, the current implementation is incorrect as it doesn't properly format the property-value pairs. The bug seems to be related to how the property-value pairs are concatenated to the command list.

### Potential Error Location:
The issue lies within the line where the property-value pair is formatted and added to the command list: `command += [name, '"{0}={1}"'.format(prop, value)]`.

### Cause of the Bug:
The bug causes the property and value to be enclosed in double quotes as a single string instead of having the property and value separated correctly. This leads to incorrect formatting of the command list, causing the test cases to fail when comparing the expected command list with the actual one.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to change the way the property and value are formatted and added to the command list. We should separate the property and value properly and remove unnecessary quotes.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, '--{0}={1}'.format(prop, val)]  # Properly format the property-value pairs
    return command
```

This corrected version ensures that the property and value pairs are formatted correctly without unnecessary double quotes, allowing the command list to be constructed properly.
