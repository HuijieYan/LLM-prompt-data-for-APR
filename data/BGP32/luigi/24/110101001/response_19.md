### Bug Explanation
The bug in the `_dict_arg` function is caused by the reusing of the variable name `value` within the loop to iterate over the dictionary values. This causes the original `value` parameter to be overwritten with the inner loop's values, leading to incorrect processing and generation of the `command` list.

### Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, you need to rename the inner loop variable from `value` to something else to avoid shadowing the original `value` parameter. This way, the original `value` parameter will not be affected by the loop iterations, and the `command` list will be correctly constructed.

### Corrected Version
Here is the corrected version of the `_dict_arg` function:

```python
# The corrected version of the buggy function
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():  # Change the variable name from "value" to "val"
            command += [name, '"{0}={1}"'.format(prop, val)]
    return command
```

By making this change, the inner loop variable won't overwrite the original `value` parameter, and the function should now correctly generate the `command` list as expected.
