The buggy function `_dict_arg` is intended to convert a dictionary into a list of command line arguments. However, the bug lies in how the function handles the conversion. It constructs the command list incorrectly, by wrapping the property and value in double quotes individually, leading to an incorrect format.

The correct format for command line arguments is to have the property and value together without double quotes around each pair.

To fix this bug, the function `_dict_arg` should be modified to properly format the command list by separating each property and value pair with an equal sign without double quotes.

Here is the corrected version of the `_dict_arg` function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, '{0}={1}'.format(prop, val)]
    return command
```

By making the above change, the function now properly converts the dictionary into a list of command line arguments in the correct format.

After applying the correction, the failing test cases provided should now pass without any issues.
