#### Potential Error Locations:
1. The function is using the same variable name `value` for both the input parameter and the loop variable inside the `for` loop, causing a conflict and potential data overwrite.
2. The function is incorrectly formatting the command by adding unnecessary double quotes around the key-value pairs.

#### Cause of the Bug:
The bug is causing the `prop=value` pairs to be enclosed in unnecessary double quotes, which is not expected in the test cases provided. This is due to the incorrect formatting of the key-value pairs in the `command` list.

#### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to rename the loop variable to avoid collision with the input parameter `value`. Additionally, we need to adjust the formatting of `name` and the key-value pairs to generate the correct command list.

#### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for key, val in value.items():
            command += [name, '{0}={1}'.format(key, val)]
    return command
```

With these changes, the function correctly formats the command list with key-value pairs without unnecessary double quotes. This should allow the function to pass the failing test cases provided.
