The bug in the `_dict_arg` function is caused by reusing the variable name `value` in the loop that iterates over the items of the input dictionary. This causes the inner loop to overwrite the outer loop's `value` variable, leading to incorrect results.

To fix the bug, it is necessary to use a different variable name in the inner loop to avoid overwriting the value of the outer loop.

Here is the corrected version of the `_dict_arg` function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, '"{0}={1}"'.format(prop, val)]
    return command
```

By using `val` instead of `value` in the inner loop, the function will correctly generate the command list without overwriting any variables.

This correction will ensure that the correct arguments are added to the command list in both cases, fixing the bug and allowing the failing tests to pass.
