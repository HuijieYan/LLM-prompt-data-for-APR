### Analysis:
The buggy function `_dict_arg` is supposed to take a key-value dictionary and output a list with the key-value pairs formatted correctly as command line arguments. However, the bug is that it incorrectly adds quotes around the value part of the key-value pair when constructing the command list.

### Bug Explanation:
When the function encounters a key-value pair, it adds quotes around the value without checking if the value is already a string. This results in double-quoting the value part of the key-value pair in the final command list.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to modify the code to only wrap the value with quotes if it is not already a string.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            val_str = '"{}"'.format(val) if not isinstance(val, str) else val
            command += [name, '{}={}'.format(prop, val_str)]
    return command
```

With this correction, the function checks if the value is already a string before adding quotes, ensuring that the value part of the key-value pair is formatted correctly in the final command list.
