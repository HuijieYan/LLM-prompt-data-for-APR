### Analysis
The `_dict_arg` function in the `SparkSubmitTask` class is intended to convert a dictionary input into a list of command line arguments. The bug in the current implementation is that it incorrectly formats the dictionary values as command line arguments. Specifically, it mistakenly wraps the property-value pair within double quotes resulting in incorrect command arguments.

### Bug Cause
The bug occurs because the function mistakenly adds double quotes around the property=value pairs when constructing the command arguments. This leads to incorrect command formation and causes the failing test cases.

### Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to correctly format the property-value pairs without adding unnecessary double quotes. This can be achieved by adjusting how the argument is constructed within the loop iterating over the dictionary items.

### Corrected Version
```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [f"{name}={prop}={val}"]
    return command
```

### Updated Analysis
After updating the `_dict_arg` function with the corrected version, the function now correctly constructs the command arguments without unnecessary double quotes around property-value pairs. This change should fix the bug and make the failing test cases pass.
