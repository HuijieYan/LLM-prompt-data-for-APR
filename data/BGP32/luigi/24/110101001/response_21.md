The issue in the `_dict_arg` function is that the variable `value` is being overwritten inside the loop, leading to incorrect values being added to the `command` list.

The buggy function should be fixed by using a different variable name inside the loop to avoid overwriting the input `value`.

Here is the corrected version of the `_dict_arg` function:

```python
class SparkSubmitTask(luigi.Task):
    """
    Template task for running a Spark job
    
    Supports running jobs on Spark local, standalone, Mesos or Yarn
    
    See http://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/submitting-applications.html
    for more information
    """

    def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
        command = []
        if value and isinstance(value, dict):
            for prop, prop_value in value.items():  # Changed variable name to prop_value to avoid overwriting
                command += [name, '"{0}={1}"'.format(prop, prop_value)]
        return command
```

With this correction, the values extracted from the input dictionary will be correctly added to the `command` list, and the failing tests should pass.
