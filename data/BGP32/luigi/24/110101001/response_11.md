### Potential Error Locations
1. The function is iterating over the input `value` dictionary but overwriting the variable `value` inside the loop, which could lead to unexpected behavior.
2. The function is not handling cases where `value` is empty or not a dictionary.

### Cause of the Bug
The bug is caused by the function overwriting the `value` variable inside the loop, leading to incorrect processing of the dictionary items. Additionally, the function does not handle cases where `value` is empty or not a dictionary, which can cause errors or unexpected output.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug
1. Rename the loop variable from `value` to something else to avoid overwriting the function parameter.
2. Add a check at the beginning to handle cases where `value` is empty or not a dictionary.

### Corrected Version of the Function
```python
# The corrected version of the buggy function
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if not value or not isinstance(value, dict):
        return command

    for prop_key, prop_value in value.items():
        command += [name, '"{0}={1}"'.format(prop_key, prop_value)]
    
    return command
``` 

By implementing the suggested fixes, the function will now correctly process the input dictionary without overwriting variables and handle cases where `value` is empty or not a dictionary. This corrected version should pass the failing tests.
