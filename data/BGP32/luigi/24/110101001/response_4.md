The bug in the `_dict_arg` function lies in the fact that it is using the same variable name `value` for the dictionary keys and values iteration. This causes the function to overwrite the original `value` input variable, leading to incorrect behavior.

To fix this bug, we need to use different variable names for the dictionary iteration within the function. Here is the corrected version:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, prop_value in value.items():
            command += [name, '"{0}={1}"'.format(prop, prop_value)]
    return command
```

By renaming the inner loop variable to `prop_value`, we ensure that the original `value` input is not overwritten and the correct key-value pairs are appended to the `command` list.

With this correction, the function should now properly handle dictionary arguments without causing any bugs or overwriting variables.
