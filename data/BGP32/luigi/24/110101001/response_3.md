### Bug Explanation
The bug in the `_dict_arg` function is caused by reusing the variable `value` in the loop to iterate the dictionary items, which overwrites the initial `value` input parameter value. This results in incorrect key-value pairs being added to the `command` list, leading to a failure in the test cases.

### Bug Fix
To fix the bug, we need to change the variable name inside the loop from `value` to something else to avoid overwriting the original `value` input parameter.

### Corrected Version
```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, prop_value in value.items():
            command += [name, '"{0}={1}"'.format(prop, prop_value)]
    return command
```

By making this change, the loop will correctly iterate over the key-value pairs in the input dictionary without overwriting the `value` variable, fixing the bug.
