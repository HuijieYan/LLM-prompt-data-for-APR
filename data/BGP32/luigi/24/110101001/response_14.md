### Bug Explanation:
The bug in the `_dict_arg` function is related to the way the function constructs the command list. It is currently adding each dictionary key-value pair as a separate element in the command list, wrapped in double quotes. This results in incorrect command generation, causing the failing tests.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix this bug, we need to adjust how the function constructs the command list when processing a dictionary input. Instead of adding each key-value pair separately, we should construct a single string for each key-value pair and then add it to the command list.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command.append(f'{name} {prop}={val}')
    return command
```

By using formatted strings to combine the property and value within a single element in the command list, we ensure the correct structure that matches the expected commands in the test cases.

This corrected version of the function should address the bug and make the failing tests pass.
