### Bug Explanation
The bug in the `_dict_arg` function lies in the fact that it reuses the variable name `value` to iterate over the dictionary items, causing conflicts with the function parameter `value`. This leads to incorrect processing of the dictionary items, resulting in the wrong output.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To resolve the bug, we need to rename the variable used in the iteration of the dictionary items to avoid conflicts with the function parameter `value`. By doing this, we can ensure that the dictionary is processed correctly and the command list is generated accurately.

### Corrected Version of the Function
```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, prop_value in value.items():  # Rename the variable to avoid conflicts
            command += [name, '"{0}={1}"'.format(prop, prop_value)]
    return command
``` 

By making this change, the function will iteratively process the dictionary items correctly, resulting in the expected command list generation.
