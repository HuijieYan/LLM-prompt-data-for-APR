### Bug Explanation:
The bug in the `_dict_arg` function arises from reusing the variable name `value` in the loop to iterate over the dictionary items. This causes confusion and overwrites the original `value` variable, leading to incorrect behavior when constructing the command list.

### Fix Strategy:
To resolve the bug, it is necessary to use different variable names inside the loop to avoid overshadowing the original `value` variable. Additionally, the way the command list is built needs to be improved to correctly format the key-value pairs from the dictionary.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, '"{0}={1}"'.format(prop, val)]
    return command
```

By implementing the above corrected version of the `_dict_arg` function, the reassignment of variables inside the loop is prevented, and the command list is properly constructed with the key-value pairs from the input dictionary.
