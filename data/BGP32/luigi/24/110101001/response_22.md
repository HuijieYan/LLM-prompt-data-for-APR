The buggy function `_dict_arg` is designed to take a dictionary and convert it into a list of command-line arguments. However, it has a bug in the way it constructs the command list using the dictionary items.

The issue lies in the loop that iterates over the dictionary items. The problem is that the loop variable "value" is being reused for both the outer and inner loop. This causes the inner loop to overwrite the value of the outer loop, resulting in incorrect command construction.

To fix the bug, we need to rename the loop variable inside the inner loop to avoid conflicts with the outer loop.

Here is the corrected version of the `_dict_arg` function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():  # Rename the inner loop variable to val to avoid conflicts
            command += [name, '"{0}={1}"'.format(prop, val)]
    return command
```

By making this change, the function will correctly construct the command list without overwriting values and will pass the failing tests.
