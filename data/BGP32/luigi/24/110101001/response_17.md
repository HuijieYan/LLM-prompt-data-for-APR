### Bug Explanation
The bug in the `_dict_arg` function is caused by the fact that the loop variable `value` is being used both as the input to the function and as the loop variable to iterate over the dictionary items. This results in the loop variable overwriting the input variable, causing incorrect behavior.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, it is necessary to rename the loop variable so that it does not overwrite the input variable. This way, the loop variable will represent the property of the dictionary item, and the input variable will represent the dictionary itself.

### Corrected Version
```python
class SparkSubmitTask(luigi.Task):
    def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
        command = []
        if value and isinstance(value, dict):
            for prop, val in value.items():  # Rename loop variable to avoid overwriting
                command += [name, '"{0}={1}"'.format(prop, val)]
        return command
```

By renaming the loop variable from `value` to `val`, we prevent the overwriting issue and ensure that each property and value pair from the dictionary is correctly added to the command list. This corrected version should fix the bug and pass the failing test cases.
