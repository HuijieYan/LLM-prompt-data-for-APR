The buggy function `_dict_arg` is designed to iterate over a dictionary and construct a list of command arguments. The bug in the function lies in reusing the variable `value` for both the outer value and the inner value within the loop. This results in the inner `value` overwriting the outer `value`, causing incorrect output.

To fix this bug, the inner loop variable should be named differently to avoid overwriting the outer variable. Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, prop_value in value.items():  # Use a different name for inner loop variable
            command += [name, '"{0}={1}"'.format(prop, prop_value)]
    return command
```

By renaming the inner loop variable to `prop_value`, we prevent the overwrite issue encountered in the buggy function.

This corrected version of the function should now pass the failing tests provided.
