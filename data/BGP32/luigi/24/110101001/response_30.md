The bug in the `_dict_arg` function is caused by using the same variable name `value` in the for loop to iterate over the items of the input dictionary. This causes the original `value` variable to be overwritten, leading to incorrect behavior.

To fix this bug, we need to use a different variable name in the for loop to avoid overwriting the original `value` variable.

Here is the corrected version of the `_dict_arg` function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, '"{0}={1}"'.format(prop, val)]
    return command
```

By replacing the variable name `value` with `val` in the for loop, we prevent overwriting the original `value` variable and ensure correct processing of the input dictionary.

After applying this fix, the function should now correctly generate the command list based on the input dictionary values, and the failing tests should pass.
