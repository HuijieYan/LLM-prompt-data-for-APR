### Analysis:
The buggy function `_dict_arg` is intended to process dictionary arguments and convert them into Spark command arguments. However, the current implementation is failing to handle the dictionary values correctly, leading to incorrect command generation.

### Bug Explanation:
1. The function is iterating over the dictionary items using the variable `value` for both the key and value inside the loop, which is causing it to overwrite the input `value` parameter. This leads to incorrect command generation with the wrong key-value pairs and the wrong value.
2. Additionally, while constructing the command list, unnecessary double quotes are being added around the key-value pairs, causing the command to be formatted incorrectly.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Change the variable inside the loop from `value` to another variable name to avoid overwriting the input parameter value.
2. Remove the unnecessary double quotes around the key-value pairs while constructing the command list.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for key, val in value.items():
            command += [name, '{0}={1}'.format(key, val)]
    return command
```

By making the above changes, the function will correctly generate the Spark command arguments from the input dictionary values and produce the expected output, allowing the failing test cases to pass.
