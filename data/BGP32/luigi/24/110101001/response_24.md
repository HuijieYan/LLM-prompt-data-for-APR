### Analysis
The buggy function `_dict_arg` is supposed to convert a dictionary into a list of command-line arguments. The main issue in the function is that it uses the variable name `value` both for the input value and as a loop variable to iterate over the dictionary, which causes a conflict and assigns incorrect values to the properties and values in the resulting command list.

### Bug Cause
In the provided buggy function, the variable `value` is being used both as the input value and as a loop variable to iterate over the dictionary. This leads to incorrect assignments of `value` and `prop` within the loop, resulting in incorrect command list elements being created.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug
To fix the bug, we need to separate the input value (`value`) from the loop variable that iterates over the dictionary. We should rename the loop variable in the for-loop to avoid conflicts with the input value variable.

### Corrected Version of the Function
```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():  # rename value to val to avoid conflicts
            command += [name, '"{0}={1}"'.format(prop, val)]
    return command
```

By renaming the loop variable `value` to `val`, the function will correctly iterate over the dictionary and generate the expected command list elements. This correction should resolve the issues seen in the failing tests.
