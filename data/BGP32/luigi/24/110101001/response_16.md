The bug in the `_dict_arg` function seems to be caused by reusing the variable name `value` within the loop, which overwrites the original `value` input parameter. This leads to incorrect formatting of the dictionary values when constructing the `command` list.

To fix this bug, we need to use a different variable name inside the loop to avoid overwriting the original `value` input parameter.

Here is the corrected version of the `_dict_arg` function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():  # Use a different variable name here to avoid overwriting
            command += [name, '"{0}={1}"'.format(prop, val)]
    return command
```

By making this change, the function should now correctly construct the command list based on the input dictionary values. The provided test cases for the buggy function should pass with this corrected version.
