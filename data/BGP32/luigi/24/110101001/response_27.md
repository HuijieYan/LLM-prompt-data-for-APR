The bug in the `_dict_arg` function is caused by using the same variable name `value` in the loop to iterate through the dictionary and also as an input parameter. This leads to the original `value` being overwritten and causing incorrect command generation.

To fix the bug, we need to use a different variable name for the loop iterator within the function. Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: luigi/contrib/spark.py

# The declaration of the class containing the buggy function
class SparkSubmitTask(luigi.Task):
    """
    Template task for running a Spark job
    
    Supports running jobs on Spark local, standalone, Mesos or Yarn
    
    See http://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/submitting-applications.html
    for more information
    """




    # this is the corrected function
    def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
        command = []
        if value and isinstance(value, dict):
            for prop, val in value.items():
                command += [name, '"{0}={1}"'.format(prop, val)]
        return command
```

By using `val` as the loop iterator variable instead of `value`, the correct values from the input dictionary will be used to generate the command list.

This corrected version should pass the failing tests provided.
