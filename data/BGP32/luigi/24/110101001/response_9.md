The bug in the `_dict_arg` function is caused by using the same variable `value` to iterate over the dictionary and store individual values. This leads to incorrect values being stored in the `command` list. To fix this, we need to use a different variable name for the nested iteration.

Here is the corrected version of the `_dict_arg` function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():  # Change the variable name here
            command += [name, '"{0}={1}"'.format(prop, val)]  # Use 'val' instead of 'value'
    return command
```

By making this change, the function will correctly separate the property-value pairs from the input dictionary and form the `command` list as expected.

This corrected version should now pass the failing tests provided.
