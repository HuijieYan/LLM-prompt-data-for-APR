## Analysis
The buggy function `_dict_arg` is intended to convert a dictionary into a list of command-line arguments. However, the current implementation is causing the failure of the test cases because it incorrectly handles the formatting of the key-value pairs in the dictionary.

## Bug Explanation
The bug in the `_dict_arg` function is due to the incorrect formatting of the key-value pairs when generating the command list. The function is using double quotes around the entire key-value pair, which is not standard for command-line arguments. This causes the test cases to fail as they are expecting a different format for the arguments.

## Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to modify the way key-value pairs are formatted in the command list. Instead of using double quotes around the entire key-value pair, we should generate them as individual arguments. This will ensure that the command list is correctly formatted for the test cases to pass.

## Corrected Version
```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, prop + '=' + val]
    return command
```

With this corrected version, the key-value pairs will be formatted as individual arguments without extra quotes, which aligns with the expected format in the test cases. This change should make the test cases pass successfully.
