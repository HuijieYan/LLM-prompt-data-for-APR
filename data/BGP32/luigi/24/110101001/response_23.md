The bug in the `_dict_arg` function lies in reusing the variable name `value` for the loop iteration variable and the value of the dictionary properties. This causes the inner loop to overwrite the value passed as an argument to the function. Instead, we need to use a separate variable for the loop iteration to avoid this conflict.

To fix this bug, we should rename the loop iteration variable so that it does not conflict with the argument variable `value`. Here is the corrected version of the `_dict_arg` function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, '"{0}={1}"'.format(prop, val)]
    return command
```

By renaming the loop iteration variable to `val`, we ensure that the original `value` passed as an argument is not affected by the iteration process.

After applying this fix, the function should correctly generate the command list based on the dictionary input and pass the failing tests provided.
