### Analysis:
The buggy function `_dict_arg` is intended to construct command arguments for a Spark job based on a dictionary of properties provided as input. However, the current implementation is encountering an issue where it incorrectly formats the properties for the command string, adding unnecessary quotation marks and equal signs.

### Bug Explanation:
The bug arises from how the function constructs the command list by looping through the key-value pairs of the input dictionary. The use of `format` within the list addition operation is combining the property name and value with unnecessary quotes. This results in a malformed command when joining all the elements.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to modify the way the properties are added to the command list. We should remove the unnecessary quotes and equal signs from each property pair.

### Updated Corrected Version:
```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, prop_value in value.items():
            command.extend([name, '{}={}'.format(prop, prop_value)])
    return command
```

By using `extend` instead of `+=` and formatting the property pairs without quotes, the corrected version of `_dict_arg` should now properly construct the command list for Spark job arguments. This fix should address the issues observed in the failing tests.
