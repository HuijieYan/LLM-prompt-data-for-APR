The bug in the `_dict_arg` function is caused by reusing the variable name `value` inside the loop, which overwrites the input `value` dictionary. This causes incorrect values to be appended to the `command` list. 

To fix this bug, simply rename the inner loop variable from `value` to something else to avoid overriding the input dictionary. Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():  # Renamed value to val
            command += [name, '"{0}={1}"'.format(prop, val)]
    return command
```

By making this change, the function will correctly loop through the key-value pairs in the input dictionary and append the formatted strings to the `command` list without interference. This should make the failing tests pass.
