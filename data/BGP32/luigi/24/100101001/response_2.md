### Bug Explanation:
The bug in the `_dict_arg` function arises from the fact that the variable name `value` of the outer loop is being overwritten by the inner loop iteration variable also named `value`. This causes incorrect processing and concatenation of the command list.

### Bug Fix:
To fix the bug, we should use different variable names for the iteration variables in the inner loop to avoid conflicts with the outer loop variable names.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():  # Changed variable name from value to val
            command += [name, '"{0}={1}"'.format(prop, val)]  # Use val instead of value
    return command
``` 

By making these changes, the function should now correctly handle the input dictionaries and build the command list as expected.
