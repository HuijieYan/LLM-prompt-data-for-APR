The bug in the `_dict_arg` function lies in the usage of the same variable `value` for both the input parameter and the loop variable inside the function. This causes the original `value` input to be overwritten during the loop iteration, leading to incorrect results.

To fix this bug, we need to use a different variable name for the loop iteration to avoid overwriting the original `value`. Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
# The corrected version of the buggy function
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, prop_value in value.items():
            command += [name, '"{0}={1}"'.format(prop, prop_value)]
    return command
```

By using `prop_value` as the loop variable instead of `value`, we prevent overwriting the original input `value`.

Once this corrected function is implemented, the failing tests should pass as the function will correctly construct the command list based on the input dictionary.
