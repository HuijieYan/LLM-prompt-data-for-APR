### Analyzing the buggy function and failing tests
The `_dict_arg` function is designed to convert dictionary key-value pairs into a list of command line arguments. However, the bug seems to stem from how the function handles formatting the key-value pairs into a string. The function is currently using double quotes around both the key and value, which might cause issues when passing these arguments to the command line.

### Identified issue
The bug lies in the line `command += [name, '"{0}={1}"'.format(prop, value)]`, where the key-value pairs are being encapsulated in double quotes. This formatting might not be compatible with the command line.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix this bug, we should remove the double quotes around the key and value pairs and simply concatenate them with the equal sign '='. This will create command line arguments that are correctly formatted and can be passed to subprocess.

### Corrected Version of the Function
```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, "{}={}".format(prop, val)]
    return command
```

By making this change, the function should now correctly convert dictionary key-value pairs into a list of command line arguments without any formatting issues. This corrected version should pass the failing tests.
