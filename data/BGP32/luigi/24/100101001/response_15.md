### Analysis
The buggy function `_dict_arg` is intended to take a dictionary of properties and values and convert them into a list of strings formatted as `name="value"` pairs. However, the bug lies in the line where the function is creating the final command list by directly appending the `name` argument and the formatted `prop=value` string. This results in an incorrect command list when the `--conf` argument is processed.

### Bug Explanation
In both cases, the buggy function incorrectly appends the `name` argument and the formatted property-value string when building the `command` list. This leads to the final command list containing the argument repeated twice (e.g., `--conf "--conf=Prop=Value"`), which is incorrect and causes the failing tests to fail.

### Bug Fix
To fix the bug, we need to modify how the `name` argument is concatenated with the property-value string. Instead of directly appending `name` before the formatted property-value string, we should include it as a separate element in the `command` list.

### Corrected Version
```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, '"{0}={1}"'.format(prop, val)]
    return command
```

By making this change, the corrected function properly builds the command list with the correct structure, ensuring that the `name="value"` pairs are correctly formed without duplication.
