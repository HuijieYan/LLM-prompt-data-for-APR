The bug in the `_dict_arg` function arises from the fact that the loop variable `value` is being re-used both for the input parameter `value` and the values in the dictionary `value.items()`. This causes a conflict and leads to incorrect behavior when constructing the `command` list.

To fix this bug, it is recommended to change the variable name used in the loop from `value` to something else to avoid overwriting the input parameter value.

Here is the corrected version of the `_dict_arg` function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():  # changed variable name to 'val'
            command += [name, '"{0}={1}"'.format(prop, val)]  # using 'val' instead of 'value'
    return command
```

By making this change, the function should now correctly construct the `command` list based on the input dictionary. This corrected version should pass the failing tests provided.
