### Potential Error Location
The error in the provided function is likely in the line where the command is constructed by concatenating the name, prop, and value. The issue lies in the formatting of the command and how the key-value pairs from the dictionary are being handled.

### Cause of the Bug
The bug arises from how the command is being constructed within the `_dict_arg` function. The current implementation includes unnecessary double quotes around the key-value pairs, causing a mismatch in the expected output and leading to test failures.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug
To fix the bug, the unnecessary double quotes should be removed from around the key-value pairs in the command construction. This can be achieved by changing the format used when appending the prop and value to the command list.

### Corrected Version of the Function
```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, '{0}={1}'.format(prop, val)]
    return command
```

By removing the double quotes in the command construction and using a simple `prop=val` format, the corrected function should now properly handle dictionary input and construct the command as expected. This change should address the issues causing the failing tests.
