### Potential Error Locations:
1. The use of the same variable name `value` for both the input parameter and the loop variable inside the function could cause confusion and lead to unexpected behavior.
2. Incorrect handling of the format when constructing the command list using `name` and the `format` method.

### Cause of the Bug:
The bug occurs because the function is incorrectly constructing the command list when iterating over the dictionary items. The format used to create each element in the list is not consistent with the expected output format, causing the test cases to fail.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
1. Use a different variable name for the loop variable inside the function to avoid conflicts with the input parameter.
2. Modify the format used to construct the command list to match the expected format of `'name=value'`.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, '{0}={1}'.format(prop, val)]
    return command
```

With these changes, the function now correctly constructs the command list using the input parameters and formats them as `'name=value'`. This should address the issues seen in the failing test cases.
