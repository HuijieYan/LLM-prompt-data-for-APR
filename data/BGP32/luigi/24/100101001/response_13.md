### Analysis:
The buggy function `_dict_arg` is intended to convert a dictionary `value` into a list of command arguments by iterating over its key-value pairs. The bug seems to lie in how the key-value pairs are being formatted and added to the `command` list. The current implementation adds unnecessary quotes around the key-value pairs, causing the failure in the test cases.

### Bug Cause:
1. The bug is caused by the unnecessary double quotes around the key-value pairs when formatting them as command arguments. This causes mismatches in the expected and actual output in the failing test cases.

### Bug Fix:
To fix the bug, we should remove the unnecessary double quotes around the key-value pairs while formatting them. This way, the generated command list will match the expected output in the failing test cases.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, '{0}={1}'.format(prop, val)]
    return command
```

By removing the unnecessary double quotes around the `"prop=value"` formatting, the corrected version of the function should now correctly format the key-value pairs as command arguments and pass the failing test cases.
