### Analysis
The buggy function `_dict_arg` is intended to convert a dictionary into a list of command-line arguments. The bug seems to be related to the way the arguments are appended to the `command` list.

### Potential Error
The bug seems to be in how the argument values are being formatted and appended to the `command` list. The use of double quotes around the key-value pair is causing the issue.

### Cause of the Bug
The bug is caused by the unnecessary double quotes around each key-value pair in the `command` list. This causes the command to be incorrectly formatted when used in the test functions, leading to test failures.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug
To fix the bug, we need to remove the double quotes around the key-value pairs when formatting the arguments. This will ensure that the command is correctly formatted for the test functions to pass.

### Corrected Version of the Function
```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, '{0}={1}'.format(prop, val)]
    return command
```

By removing the unnecessary double quotes in the `'{0}={1}'.format(prop, val)` formatting, the corrected function now properly formats the command arguments without extra characters. This should address the issue and make the test functions pass.
