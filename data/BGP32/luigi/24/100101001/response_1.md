### Analysis
The buggy function `_dict_arg` is intended to process a dictionary and create a list of command arguments based on the key-value pairs in the dictionary. However, the bug lies in how it handles the formatting of the arguments, specifically in the format `'{0}={1}'`.

### Bug Explanation
The bug occurs because the function incorrectly formats the key-value pairs as `"{0}={1}"`. This results in the key and value being enclosed in double quotes, which is not the expected format for command line arguments.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, the function should format the key-value pairs without enclosing them in double quotes, as command line arguments typically do not have quotes around individual arguments.

### Corrected Version of the Function
```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, '{}={}'.format(prop, val)]
    return command
```

With this correction, the function will correctly format the key-value pairs as `prop=val`, which is the expected format for command line arguments. This change should make the function compatible with the failing tests and ensure the correct behavior when processing dictionaries for command line arguments.
