### Bug Explanation
The bug occurs because the function `_dict_arg` is incorrectly handling the construction of command arguments. The function is supposed to take a dictionary and convert it into a list of command arguments, but it is not handling the values correctly. The bug causes the values from the dictionary to be quoted when constructing the command, resulting in incorrect command arguments being returned.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to adjust how the values are added to the command list. We need to ensure that the values from the dictionary are not quoted when constructing the command arguments. This can be achieved by removing the quotation marks around the values in the command list.

### Corrected Version of the Function
```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, '{0}={1}'.format(prop, val)]
    return command
```

By removing the quotation marks around the values in the command list, the function will correctly construct the command arguments without causing the test failures.
