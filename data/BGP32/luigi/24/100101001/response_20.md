#### Explanation of the Bug:
The bug in the `_dict_arg` function arises from the fact that the variable name inside the for loop is being overwritten by the loop variable name. This leads to incorrect generation of the command list.

In Case 1, when processing the input `{ 'Prop': 'Value' }`, the loop variable `value` in `for prop, value in value.items()` is overwriting the function parameter `value`. As a result, the correct value for the property is not appended to the `command` list. 

In Case 2, the same issue occurs where the loop variable `value` is overwriting the function parameter `value`, causing the wrong value to be used in building the command list.

#### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the loop variable names do not conflict with the function parameter names. One simple solution is to change the loop variable name from `value` to something else that does not clash with the function parameter names.

#### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, prop_value in value.items():
            command += [name, '"{0}={1}"'.format(prop, prop_value)]
    return command
```

By renaming the loop variable from `value` to `prop_value`, we avoid conflicts with the function parameter names and correctly build the command list. This correction should address the bug and make the function work as expected.
