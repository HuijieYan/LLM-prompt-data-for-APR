The bug in the `_dict_arg` function is caused by reusing the variable name `value` inside the for loop, which overwrites the original `value` dictionary. This results in incorrect key-value pairs being added to the `command` list. To fix this bug, we need to use a different variable name inside the loop to avoid overwriting the original `value` dictionary.

Here is the corrected version of the `_dict_arg` function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():  # use a different variable name here to avoid overwriting the original 'value'
            command += [name, '"{0}={1}"'.format(prop, val)]
    return command
```

By using a different variable name (e.g., `val`) inside the loop, we prevent conflicts and ensure that the correct key-value pairs are added to the `command` list based on the input dictionary.

After making this change, the corrected `_dict_arg` function should now correctly build the command list based on the input dictionary without overwriting values.
