### Potential Error Location
The bug in the `_dict_arg` function lies in the way the key-value pairs from the dictionary `value` are being appended to the `command` list. The current implementation incorrectly quotes the key-value pairs, resulting in the test cases failing due to a mismatch in the expected call arguments.

### Cause of the Bug
1. In Case 1, the function incorrectly appends `'{0}={1}'.format(prop, value)` within double quotes, resulting in a malformed argument that does not match the expected format in the test case.
2. In Case 2, the same issue occurs where the key-value pair is incorrectly quoted, leading to a mismatch in the test case assertion.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug
To fix the bug, we need to remove the unnecessary double quotes around the key-value pairs when constructing the command list based on the dictionary items. By removing the quotes, the function will generate the correct command arguments that align with the test cases.

### Corrected Version of the Function
```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, '{0}={1}'.format(prop, val)]
    return command
```

By making this small change in the function, the key-value pairs will be correctly formatted without unnecessary quotes, allowing the function to pass the failing test cases.
