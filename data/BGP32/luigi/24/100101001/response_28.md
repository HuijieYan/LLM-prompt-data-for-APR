### Bug Analysis
The buggy function `_dict_arg` is designed to convert a dictionary into a list of command line arguments. However, the issue lies in how the key-value pairs of the dictionary are being processed. The bug occurs because the function mistakenly reuses the variable `value` both to iterate through the dictionary items and to store the value of each item. This results in overwriting the original `value` parameter with the individual values from the dictionary.

### Bug Explanation
In Case 1, when the dictionary `{'Prop': 'Value'}` is passed, the function incorrectly processes the key-value pair. It appends `name` and a formatted string of the key-value pair to the `command` list. However, due to the reuse of the `value` variable in the for loop, the original value passed to the function (`'--conf'`) is overridden with the value of the key in the dictionary (`'Value'`). This leads to the wrong output in the `command` list.

The same issue occurs in Case 2, where the dictionary `{'prop1': 'val1'}` is passed. The function incorrectly appends the key-value pair to the `command` list, resulting in the value `val1` overwriting the original input value of `value`.

### Bug Fix
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the variable `value` used in the for loop does not conflict with the function parameter `value`. One way to resolve this issue is to use a different variable name for the loop iteration. Additionally, we should concatenate the elements directly without using unnecessary string formatting.

### Corrected Version
```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for key, val in value.items():
            command += [name, key + '=' + val]
    return command
``` 

By making these changes, the corrected version of the `_dict_arg` function should now properly convert dictionary items into a list of command line arguments without overwriting any values.
