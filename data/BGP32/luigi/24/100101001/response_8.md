### Analysis
The `_dict_arg` function is intended to format a dictionary into a list of command line arguments. The bug seems to be related to how the function constructs the command list using the dictionary provided.

### Bug Explanation
The bug occurs because the function is overwriting the variable `value` inside the loop, which leads to incorrect command generation. Specifically, when iterating over the dictionary items, the function is using the same variable `value` to store the value from the dictionary item, but this overwrites the original input dictionary `value`, leading to incorrect command formation.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we should avoid using the same variable `value` inside the loop that iterates over the dictionary items. Instead, we should use another variable name to store the value temporarily. This ensures that the original input dictionary `value` remains intact.

### Corrected Version
```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():  # Use a different variable name than 'value'
            command += [name, '"{0}={1}"'.format(prop, val)]  # Use 'val' instead of 'value'
    return command
```

By making this change, the function should now correctly generate the command list based on the input dictionary, ensuring that the original input dictionary is not modified during the process. This corrected version should pass the failing test cases provided.
