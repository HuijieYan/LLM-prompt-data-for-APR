The bug in the `_dict_arg` function lies in the fact that it overwrites the variable `value` in the loop which causes the incorrect output. This occurs because the loop variable `value` is being reused for both the loop and the argument value inside the loop.

To fix this issue, the loop variable name should be different from the argument value name. Here's the corrected version of the `_dict_arg` function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():  # Change the loop variable name to 'val'
            command += [name, '"{0}={1}"'.format(prop, val)]  # Use 'val' instead of 'value'
    return command
```

By making this change, the function will correctly construct the command list without overwriting the argument value unnecessarily.

With this correction, the function should now return the expected command list in both test cases provided.
