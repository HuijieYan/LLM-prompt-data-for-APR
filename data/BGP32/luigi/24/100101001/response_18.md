### Analysis:
The buggy function `_dict_arg` is designed to convert a dictionary into a list of command arguments. The bug seems to lie in the way the key-value pairs are formatted in the resulting command list. The current implementation is adding unnecessary quotes around the values, which is causing the test cases to fail.

### Potential Error:
The issue lies in the line `command += [name, '"{0}={1}"'.format(prop, value)]`. The unnecessary double quotes around `{1}` are causing the values to be formatted incorrectly in the command list.

### Cause of the Bug:
The bug is causing the values in the dictionary to be enclosed within double quotes when forming the command list. This is not the expected behavior based on the failing test cases.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we should remove the unnecessary double quotes from around the formatted value when constructing the command list. This way, the values will be correctly formatted in the command list without additional quotes.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, "{0}={1}".format(prop, val)]
    return command
```

By making this change, the corrected function will format the dictionary key-value pairs without additional quotes around the values. This change should address the bug and make the function behave as expected based on the failing test cases.
