### Analysis:
The function `_dict_arg` is intended to convert a dictionary into a list of command-line arguments. However, the bug lies in how the function constructs these arguments. It is adding each key-value pair as a separate element in the list, but it should combine them into a single string as a key-value pair.

### Possible Error:
The bug is caused by the line: `command += [name, '"{0}={1}"'.format(prop, value)]`. It is concatenating the `name` and the formatted key-value pair as separate items in the `command` list.

### Bug Explanation:
In both cases provided, the expected output should be a list with the format `['--conf', 'prop1=val1']`. However, due to the bug, the output becomes `['--conf', '"prop1=val1"']`, which includes unnecessary double quotes around the key-value pair.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to construct the key-value pair as a single string without extra double quotes and then add it to the `command` list.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, '{}={}'.format(prop, val)]
    return command
```

With this corrected version, the function will properly generate the list of command-line arguments from the input dictionary without introducing additional quotes around the key-value pairs. This should resolve the failing tests provided.
