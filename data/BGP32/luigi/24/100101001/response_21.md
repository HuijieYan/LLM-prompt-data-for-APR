### Analysis
The buggy function `_dict_arg` is designed to construct a list of command arguments based on a given dictionary `value`, where the keys and values of the dictionary are used to form the command arguments. However, the issue lies in the way the values are being concatenated to the `command` list. In the buggy code, each key-value pair is added as a separate element in the list, causing unexpected behavior when forming the command.

#### Error
The problem occurs when constructing `command` list by directly adding elements with `+=`. This results in each argument being added separately, leading to incorrect formatting of the command list.

### Bug Cause
The buggy function generates incorrect command arguments due to the method used to concatenate the key-value pairs. The incorrect format of the command list does not match the expected format when running the tests.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug
To fix the bug, we need to modify the way the command arguments are constructed. Instead of adding key-value pairs as separate elements, we should combine them into a single element representing the argument and its value. This will ensure the correct formatting of the command list.

### Corrected Version
```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, '{0}={1}'.format(prop, val)]
    return command
```

By making this change, the function will correctly format the command list by combining the property and value pairs into single elements, matching the expected format when constructing command arguments.
