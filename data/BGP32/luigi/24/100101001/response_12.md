### Analysis
The buggy function `_dict_arg` is intended to construct a list of command-line arguments based on the input dictionary `value`, where keys are properties and values are their corresponding values. The function is currently incorrectly adding quotes around the property and value pairs.

### Error Location
The error lies in the line:
```python
command += [name, '"{0}={1}"'.format(prop, value)]
```
where unnecessary double quotes are being added around the property and value pairs.

### Bug Cause
The bug causes the generated command to include unnecessary double quotes around the property-value pairs, failing the comparison with the expected command generated by the test cases. This discrepancy leads to the failing tests.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug
1. Remove the unnecessary double quotes around the property and value in the line generating the command list.
2. Ensure that the generated command matches the expected structure and values defined in the test cases.

### Corrected Version
```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():  # changed variable name from value to val to avoid conflict
            command += [name, '{0}={1}'.format(prop, val)]  # removed unnecessary double quotes
    return command
```

By making the above changes, the corrected function should construct the command list without unnecessary characters and ensure that the output matches the expected command structure in the test cases.
