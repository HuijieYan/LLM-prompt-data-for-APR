The bug in the `_dict_arg` function occurs because the function is updating the `value` variable inside the loop, which causes an issue with the reference to the dictionary items. As a result, the command list ends up with incorrect key-value pairs.

To fix this bug, we need to use a different variable name inside the loop to avoid overwriting the original `value`. Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():  # use a different variable name (val) here
            command += [name, '"{0}={1}"'.format(prop, val)]
    
    return command
```

By using a different variable name (`val`) inside the loop, we ensure that the original `value` dictionary is not modified and the correct key-value pairs are added to the `command` list. This correction should now pass the failing test cases provided.
