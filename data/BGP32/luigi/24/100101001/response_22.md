### Bug Explanation
The bug in the `_dict_arg` function arises from the fact that the inner loop variable 'value' is being reused for two different purposes. The outer loop uses 'value' as the input dictionary, while the inner loop uses 'value' to iterate over the key-value pairs in the dictionary. This leads to the inner loop overwriting the 'value' variable used in the outer loop, causing incorrect command generation.

### Bug Fixing Strategy
To fix this bug, we need to use a different variable for the inner loop to avoid overwriting the 'value' variable in the outer loop. By using a separate variable for the inner loop, we ensure that the command list is correctly constructed without any unintended modifications.

### Corrected Version of the Function
```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():  # Using 'val' instead of 'value' in the inner loop
            command += [name, '"{0}={1}"'.format(prop, val)]
    return command
```

By making this change, the inner loop in the `_dict_arg` function will no longer overwrite the outer loop variable 'value', ensuring the correct generation of the command list. The corrected version of the function should now pass the failing test cases provided.
