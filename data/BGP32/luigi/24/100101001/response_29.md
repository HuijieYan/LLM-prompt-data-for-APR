### Analysis:
The buggy function `_dict_arg` is intended to convert a dictionary into a list of command arguments but it has a bug with double-quoting the values. This is causing the failing tests to not match the expected command arguments.

### Potential Error Location:
The error is likely occurring in the line `command += [name, '"{0}={1}"'.format(prop, value)]` where the value is being enclosed in double quotes.

### Cause of the Bug:
The bug stems from adding double quotes around the value within the command list, which is unnecessary and causing the test cases to fail.

### Fix Strategy:
Remove the unnecessary double quotes around the value while maintaining the format of `prop=value`.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, '{0}={1}'.format(prop, val)]
    return command
```

After correcting the function as described above, the test cases should pass successfully.
