### Analysis:
The buggy function `_dict_arg` is intended to convert a dictionary into a list of command arguments. The issue seems to be with how the function is building the command list by incorrectly appending the argument name and value.

### Bug:
The bug in the function lies in the line `command += [name, '"{0}={1}"'.format(prop, value)]`. This line incorrectly appends both the argument name (`name`) and the formatted string `"{0}={1}".format(prop, value)` into the `command` list, resulting in unexpected behavior.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix this bug, we need to separate the argument name and value properly in the command list by appending the name first and then the formatted string with the property and its value.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():  # Change value to val to avoid shadowing the value variable
            command += [name, '{0}={1}'.format(prop, val)]  # Append argument name and formatted string with prop and val
    return command
```

After making these corrections, the function should now properly convert the dictionary into a list of command arguments, resolving the bug.
