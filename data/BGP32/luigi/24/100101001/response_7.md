### Analysis:
The buggy function `_dict_arg` is supposed to format a dictionary into a list of command arguments. However, the current implementation is incorrect as it is not handling key-value pairs properly. The bug seems to be in the formatting of the key-value pairs within the function.

### Bug Explanation:
In both cases, the bug is caused by incorrectly formatting the key-value pairs in the command list. The function is adding unnecessary quotes around the key-value pairs when constructing the command list, leading to a mismatch with the expected output in the test cases.

### Bug Fix:
To fix the bug, we need to remove the unnecessary quotes around the key-value pairs when constructing the command list. We can achieve this by modifying the string formatting in the list comprehension inside the loop.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, '{}={}'.format(prop, val)]
    return command
```

By correcting the function as shown above, the key-value pairs will be constructed without unnecessary quotes, ensuring that the function behaves correctly according to the test cases provided.
