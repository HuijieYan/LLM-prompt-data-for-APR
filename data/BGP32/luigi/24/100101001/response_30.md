### Analysis
The buggy function is intended to process a dictionary of properties and values, converting it into a list suitable for command line arguments. However, there is an issue with how the function handles building the command list, resulting in incorrect outputs.

### Bug Explanation
The bug stems from the usage of the variable name inside the for loop to iterate over the dictionary items. The variable name is being redefined as the loop iterates, causing conflicts and incorrect values to be appended to the command list. This results in command elements being overwritten and not forming the expected key-value pairs correctly.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to rename the loop variable that iterates over the dictionary items to prevent conflicts with the variable name that represents the command argument. By using a different variable name, we ensure that the key-value pairs are correctly appended to the command list without overwriting any elements.

### Corrected Version
```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, prop_value in value.items():  # Rename this variable to avoid conflicts
            command += [name, '"{0}={1}"'.format(prop, prop_value)]
    return command
```

By making this change, the function should now correctly build the command list with the key-value pairs from the input dictionary, resolving the bug and ensuring the function works as intended.
