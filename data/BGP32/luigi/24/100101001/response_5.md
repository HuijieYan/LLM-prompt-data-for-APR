### Bug Explanation
The buggy function `_dict_arg` is not correctly formatting the key-value pairs from the input dictionary into a list of strings. The issue lies in the line `command += [name, '"{0}={1}"'.format(prop, value)]`, where the value should be enclosed within quotes, but the quotes are placed incorrectly, leading to incorrect formatting.

In Case 1, the value is enclosed within extra quotes, resulting in `'"Prop=Value"'` instead of `"Prop=Value"`. Similarly, in Case 2, the value is also enclosed within extra quotes, resulting in `'"prop1=val1"'` instead of `"prop1=val1"`.

### Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, the correct approach is to enclose the key-value pairs within quotes while maintaining the correct formatting. We need to adjust the way the values are concatenated in the list to ensure the correct format of `--key=value`.

### Corrected Version
```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, '--{0}={1}'.format(prop, val)]
    return command
``` 

After applying this correction, the function should format the key-value pairs correctly, resolving the bug and passing the failing test cases.
