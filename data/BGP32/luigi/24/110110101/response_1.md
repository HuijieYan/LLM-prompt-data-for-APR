### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_dict_arg` is supposed to generate a list of command-line arguments based on a dictionary input.
2. The issue seems to be the way the function is constructing the command list. The function is currently adding the dictionary key and value as a single string with formatting, leading to the incorrect output format.
3. The failing tests are highlighting that the function is not generating the expected command list format for dictionary input.
4. To fix the bug, we need to modify how the function concatenates the key and value pairs in the command list.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is caused by the way the function constructs the command list. The function incorrectly builds the command list by adding the key-value pairs as a single formatted string, enclosed in double quotes.

### Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to modify the `_dict_arg` function to correctly construct the command list by separating the keys and values without unnecessary formatting.

### Corrected Code:
```python
class SparkSubmitTask(luigi.Task):
    def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
        command = []
        if value and isinstance(value, dict):
            for prop, val in value.items():
                command += [name, prop + '=' + str(val)]
        return command
```

By modifying the concatenation inside the loop to "prop + '=' + str(val)", we correctly create the command list with the expected format of "key=value". This should resolve the bug and make the function return the correct command list.
