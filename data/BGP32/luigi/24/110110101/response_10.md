### Analysis
1. The provided `SparkSubmitTask` class contains a `_dict_arg` function that is intended to create a command list based on the input dictionary.
2. The `_dict_arg` function attempts to iterate over the key-value pairs in the input dictionary and format them as `"{prop}={value}"`. However, there is a bug in how the output values are being constructed.
3. The failing tests indicate that the actual output values are not matching the expected ones due to the incorrect formatting of key-value pairs.
4. To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the key-value pairs are formatted correctly without unnecessary quotation marks around the values.
5. I will update the `_dict_arg` function to correctly format the key-value pairs without unnecessary quotes.

### Updated Corrected Version
```python
# The corrected version of the _dict_arg function
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, '{0}={1}'.format(prop, val)]
    return command
```

By removing the unnecessary quotes around the values in the formatting process, the corrected `_dict_arg` function should now produce the expected output and pass the failing tests.
