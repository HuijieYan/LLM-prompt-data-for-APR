### Analysis
1. The buggy function `_dict_arg` is supposed to construct a list of command-line arguments based on the input dictionary `value`. It iterates through the key-value pairs in the dictionary and appends them to the `command` list in the format `name='value'`.
   
2. The error in the function lies in the way it adds the key-value pairs to the `command` list. It is currently enclosing the key-value pair in double quotes, which is causing the assertion errors in the test cases.
   
3. The failing test cases provide dictionaries with key-value pairs that are expected to be added to the command list without quotes. However, the buggy function incorrectly adds quotes around the values.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to modify the way the key-value pairs are added to the `command` list. Instead of enclosing them in double quotes, we should construct the command without any quotes around the values.

### Corrected Version
```python
class SparkSubmitTask(luigi.Task):
    def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
        command = []
        if value and isinstance(value, dict):
            for prop, val in value.items():
                command += [name, "{0}={1}".format(prop, val)]
        return command
```

By modifying the line `command += [name, '"{0}={1}"'.format(prop, value)]` to `command += [name, "{0}={1}".format(prop, value)]`, the bug is fixed, and the function should now correctly construct the command list without quotes around the values.
