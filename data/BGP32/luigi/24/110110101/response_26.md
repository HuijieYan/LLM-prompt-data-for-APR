### Analysis
1. The `SparkSubmitTask` class defines a method `_dict_arg` that is supposed to convert a dictionary argument into a list of command line arguments.
2. The bug seems to be related to how the dictionary arguments are converted into command line arguments.
3. The failing tests indicate that the issue lies in the formatting of key-value pairs within the command list.
4. To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the key-value pairs from the dictionary are formatted correctly in the command list.

### Bug Cause
The bug is caused by the incorrect formatting of key-value pairs from the dictionary in the command list. The buggy function is wrapping the value part within double quotes when creating the command list, causing discrepancies in the expected output format.

### Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we should modify the way key-value pairs are constructed in the `command` list. Instead of wrapping the value in double quotes, we should directly concatenate the key and value with an "=" sign. This will ensure that the formatting matches the expected output in the tests.

### Corrected Version
```python
class SparkSubmitTask(luigi.Task):
    def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
        command = []
        if value and isinstance(value, dict):
            for prop, val in value.items():
                command += [name, f'{prop}={val}']
        return command
```

By updating the `_dict_arg` function as shown above, the key-value pairs will be correctly formatted without unnecessary double quotes, thus resolving the bug.
