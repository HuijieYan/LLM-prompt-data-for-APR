### Analysis
1. The buggy function `_dict_arg` is designed to take a key-value pair dictionary and convert it into a list of command-line arguments by formatting the key and value appropriately.
2. The bug seems to be related to how the value pair is formatted as a string in the command list.
3. The failing tests provide input dictionaries with key-value pairs that need to be converted to arguments in the correct format. The bug is causing the formatting to be incorrect, leading to assertion errors.
4. To fix the bug, we need to check if the value is a string or if it needs to be quoted and adjust the formatting accordingly.
5. The corrected version of the function is provided below:

### Corrected Function
```python
class SparkSubmitTask(luigi.Task):
    def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
        command = []
        if value and isinstance(value, dict):
            for prop, val in value.items():
                formatted_val = '"{}"'.format(val) if ' ' in val else val
                command += [name, "{}={}".format(prop, formatted_val)]
        return command
```

By checking if the value contains a space and quoting it if needed, the corrected function should now correctly generate the command list from the input dictionary.
