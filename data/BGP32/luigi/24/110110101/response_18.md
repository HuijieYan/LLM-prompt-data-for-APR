### Analysis
1. The provided buggy function `_dict_arg` is intended to take a dictionary as input and convert it into a list of command line arguments. It iterates over the key-value pairs in the dictionary and formats them as `name=value` string elements in the list.
2. The main issue in the function is the incorrect handling of the key-value pairs. The current implementation includes unnecessary quotes around the `value` part, resulting in unexpected behavior.
3. The failing test cases show that the function is not formatting the command arguments correctly, leading to assertion errors due to the mismatch between expected and actual outputs.
4. To fix the bug, the function should format the key-value pairs without additional quotation marks around the value.
5. Below is the corrected version of the `_dict_arg` function:

```python
class SparkSubmitTask(luigi.Task):
    def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
        command = []
        if value and isinstance(value, dict):
            for prop, val in value.items():
                command += [name, '{0}={1}'.format(prop, val)]
        return command
```

With this corrected version, the function should now properly format the key-value pairs without unnecessary quoting, resolving the issues in the failing test cases.
