### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_dict_arg` is supposed to construct a list of command arguments based on a dictionary input.
2. The function iterates over the dictionary items, formatting them as `name=prop` and adding them to the `command` list.
3. The bug seems to be related to unnecessary double quotes around the value when constructing the command list.
4. The failing tests are checking the exact structure of the command list, and the bug causes the structure to differ with unnecessary quotes.
5. The strategy to fix the bug is to remove the unnecessary double quotes around the value in the command list construction.

### Bug Cause:
The bug in the `_dict_arg` function is caused by the unnecessary double quotes around the value when constructing the command list. This causes the actual command structure to differ from the expected command structure in the test cases, leading to assertion errors.

### Bug Fix:
To fix the bug, the unnecessary double quotes around the value should be removed during the construction of the command list.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, '{0}={1}'.format(prop, val)]
    return command
```
