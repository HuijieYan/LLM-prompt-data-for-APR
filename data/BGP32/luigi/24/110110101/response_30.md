### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_dict_arg` is designed to create a list of command arguments based on a dictionary input.
2. The bug arises from the way the function is formatting the dictionary key-value pairs into strings.
3. The failing tests highlight issues with formatting within the generated command list.
4. To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the key-value pairs from the dictionary are correctly formatted without additional quotes in the final command list.

### Bug Fix:
```python
class SparkSubmitTask(luigi.Task):
    def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
        command = []
        if value and isinstance(value, dict):
            for prop, val in value.items():
                command += [name, '{}={}'.format(prop, val)]
        return command
```

By using `format()` without additional quotation marks around the values, the bug is fixed. This correction ensures that the key-value pairs are formatted correctly in the command list.
