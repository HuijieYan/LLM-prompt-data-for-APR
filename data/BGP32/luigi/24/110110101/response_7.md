### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_dict_arg` is intended to create a list of command arguments based on a dictionary input. The function iterates over the key-value pairs in the dictionary and constructs a list with the specified format.
2. The bug in the function arises from the use of double quotes that are incorrectly added around the property-value pairs.
3. The failing tests indicate that the function is not correctly formatting the command arguments, resulting in assertion errors due to discrepancies in the expected and actual command lists.
4. To fix the bug, we need to remove the unnecessary double quotes added around the property-value pairs in the command list creation.
5. Below is the corrected version of the `_dict_arg` function:

```python
class SparkSubmitTask(luigi.Task):
    def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
        command = []
        if value and isinstance(value, dict):
            for prop, val in value.items():
                command += [name, '{}={}'.format(prop, val)]
        return command
``` 

By removing the unnecessary double quotes when constructing the command list, the corrected function should now produce the expected command list format without causing assertion errors in the tests.
