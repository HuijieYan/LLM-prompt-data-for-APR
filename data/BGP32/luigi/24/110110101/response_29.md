### Analysis
1. The `_dict_arg` function takes in a name (str) and a value (dict) as parameters. It iterates over the key-value pairs in the dictionary and generates a list of command arguments based on the format `name={key}={value}`.
2. The issue seems to be with how the function creates the command list, specifically the formatting of key-value pairs.
3. The failing tests show that the command list generated by the function includes extra double quotes around the values, which causes the assertion errors.
4. To fix the bug, we need to remove the extra double quotes around the values when generating the command list.

### Bug Fix Strategy
1. Modify the `_dict_arg` function to correctly format the key-value pairs without unnecessary double quotes.
2. Update the function to handle both cases - when the value is a dictionary and when the value is not a dictionary.

### Corrected Version
```python
class SparkSubmitTask(luigi.Task):
    """
    Template task for running a Spark job
    
    Supports running jobs on Spark local, standalone, Mesos or Yarn
    
    See http://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/submitting-applications.html
    for more information
    """

    def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
        command = []
        if value and isinstance(value, dict):
            for prop, val in value.items():
                command += [name, '{}={}'.format(prop, val)]
        return command
``` 

After applying the above correction, the `_dict_arg` function should now correctly generate the command list without extra double quotes. This will ensure that the tests pass without any assertion errors.
