### Analysis
1. The buggy function `_dict_arg` is designed to take a dictionary `value` and convert it into a list of command line arguments where each key-value pair in the dictionary is represented as `"key=value"`. However, the function is currently enclosing the value in double quotes which is causing discrepancies in the test cases.
2. The issue is identified in the line where the function is constructing the command list by adding `"{0}={1}".format(prop, value)` with double quotes around the value.
3. The error messages indicate that the function is returning command arguments with values wrapped in double quotes, leading to failures in the test cases which expect plain key-value pairs.
4. To fix the bug, we need to modify the line where the key-value pair is formatted to remove the double quotes around the value.
5. Below is the corrected version of the function.

### Corrected Function
```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: luigi/contrib/spark.py

# The declaration of the class containing the buggy function
class SparkSubmitTask(luigi.Task):
    """
    Template task for running a Spark job
    
    Supports running jobs on Spark local, standalone, Mesos or Yarn
    
    See http://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/submitting-applications.html
    for more information
    """

    # Corrected version of the buggy function
    def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
        command = []
        if value and isinstance(value, dict):
            for prop, val in value.items():
                command += [name, "{0}={1}".format(prop, val)]
        return command
```

By removing the double quotes around the value when constructing the command list, the corrected function should now pass the failing test cases and produce the expected output.
