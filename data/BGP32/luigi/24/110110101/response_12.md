### Analysis
1. The buggy function `_dict_arg` takes a `name` and a `value` as input parameters and constructs a list `command` based on the key-value pairs in the input dictionary `value`.
2. The issues in the function seem to be related to how the key-value pairs are added to the `command` list.
3. The failing test cases show that the function incorrectly formats the key-value pairs by including unnecessary quotes around the values, leading to assertion errors.
4. To fix the bug, we need to eliminate the unnecessary quotes around the values when constructing the `command` list.
5. We should modify the function to handle key-value pairs correctly and ensure that the output matches the expected format.

### Bug Fix
Here is the corrected version of the `_dict_arg` function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, '{0}={1}'.format(prop, val)]
    return command
```

By using `{0}={1}` in the `format` function instead of `"{0}={1}"`, we can remove the unnecessary quotes around the values, ensuring that the function constructs the `command` list correctly.

This corrected version should now pass the failing test cases and provide the expected output.
