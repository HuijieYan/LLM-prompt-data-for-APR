### Analysis
1. The `SparkSubmitTask` class contains a method `_dict_arg` that is intended to construct command arguments from key-value pairs in a dictionary.
2. The `_dict_arg` function takes two parameters, `name` and `value`, where `name` is a string representing the argument name and `value` is a dictionary of key-value pairs.
3. The buggy function is not properly constructing the command arguments as expected, leading to failing test cases.
4. The failing test cases point out that the function is adding unnecessary double quotes around the value in the command list, causing a mismatch with the expected list.

### Bug Cause
The bug is caused by the buggy function adding unnecessary double quotes around the value of each key-value pair in the dictionary when constructing the command list. This results in a mismatch between the actual command list and the expected command list in the test cases.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, the function needs to append the key-value pair directly to the command list without encapsulating the value in double quotes. This will ensure that the constructed command list matches the expected command list in the test cases.

### Corrected Version
```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: luigi/contrib/spark.py

# The declaration of the class containing the corrected function
class SparkSubmitTask(luigi.Task):
    """
    Template task for running a Spark job
    
    Supports running jobs on Spark local, standalone, Mesos or Yarn
    
    See http://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/submitting-applications.html
    for more information
    """

    def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
        command = []
        if value and isinstance(value, dict):
            for prop, val in value.items():
                command += [name, "{0}={1}".format(prop, val)]
        return command
```

By removing the unnecessary double quotes around the value in the constructed command list, the corrected function should now pass the failing test cases and satisfy the expected input/output values.
