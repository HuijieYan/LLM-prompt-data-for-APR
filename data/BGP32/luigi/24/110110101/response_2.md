### Explanation:
The buggy function `_dict_arg()` is intended to construct a list of command arguments based on a dictionary input. The issue arises from the way the function handles the key-value pairs in the dictionary. In the current implementation, it incorrectly wraps the key-value pairs in double quotes, resulting in a mismatch with the expected output format in the test cases.

### Suggestions for fixing the bug:
To fix the bug, we need to modify the `_dict_arg()` function to construct the command list without wrapping the values in double quotes. This will ensure that the output matches the expected format in the test cases.

### Corrected version of the function:
```python
import luigi

# The declaration of the class containing the buggy function
class SparkSubmitTask(luigi.Task):
    """
    Template task for running a Spark job
    
    Supports running jobs on Spark local, standalone, Mesos or Yarn
    
    See http://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/submitting-applications.html
    for more information
    """

    # Corrected version of the buggy function
    def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
        command = []
        if value and isinstance(value, dict):
            command += [name]  # Add the name to the command list
            for prop, val in value.items():
                command += ["{0}={1}".format(prop, val)]  # Add key-value pair as is, without double quotes
        return command
```

After making this correction, the function should now correctly construct the command list without wrapping the values in double quotes, resolving the mismatches observed in the failing test cases.
