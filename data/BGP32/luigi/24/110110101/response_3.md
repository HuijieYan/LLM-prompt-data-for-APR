### Analysis
1. The buggy function `_dict_arg` is intended to take a key-value pair in the form of a dictionary and convert it into a list of arguments, where the key is used as the argument name and the value is used as the argument value.
2. The bug in the function is caused by incorrectly formatting the argument values when constructing the command list.
3. The failing tests are pointing out that the function is incorrectly wrapping the argument values in double quotes, which causes the assertion errors due to the mismatch in the expected and actual values.
4. To fix the bug, we need to remove the unnecessary double quotes around the argument values when constructing the command list.

### Bug Fix Strategy
- Update the `_dict_arg` function to correctly construct the command list without wrapping the argument values in double quotes.

### Corrected Function
```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: luigi/contrib/spark.py

# The corrected version of the _dict_arg function
    def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
        command = []
        if value and isinstance(value, dict):
            for prop, val in value.items():
                command += [name, "{0}={1}".format(prop, val)]  # Correctly construct the command list without double quotes
        return command
``` 

By making this change in the `_dict_arg` function, the bug causing the failing tests would be fixed, and the function will now correctly generate the command list for the Spark job.
