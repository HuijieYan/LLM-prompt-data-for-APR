### Analysis
1. The buggy function `_dict_arg` takes in a `name` and a `value`, where `value` is expected to be a dictionary. It iterates over the key-value pairs in the dictionary and adds them to the `command` list with a specific format.
2. The bug is caused by the format used to append key-value pairs in the `command` list. It is currently adding quotes around the key-value pair, which is not necessary.
3. The failing tests show that the key-value pairs are not correctly formatted when added to the `command` list, leading to assertion errors due to mismatched values.
4. To fix the bug, we need to remove the unnecessary quotes around the key-value pairs in the `command` list.
5. Below is the corrected version of the `_dict_arg` function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, "{0}={1}".format(prop, val)]
    return command
``` 

By removing the unnecessary quotes around the key-value pairs in the `command` list, the corrected function should pass the failing tests and return the expected output values.
