### Analysis
1. The buggy function `_dict_arg` is supposed to take a name and a dictionary as input and convert the dictionary into a list of command line arguments.
2. The bug occurs when formatting the dictionary values. The function incorrectly adds extra quotes around the property value in the command list.
  
### Bug Explanation
- The failing test expects the property-value pairs from the dictionary to be added to the command list without quotes around the values.
- The buggy function incorrectly formats the property-value pairs with quotes, leading to a mismatch between the expected and actual command lists.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug
- Modify the function to correctly format the property-value pairs without adding quotes around the values.

### Corrected Code
```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, prop_value in value.items():
            command += [name, '{0}={1}'.format(prop, prop_value)]
    return command
```

By removing the unnecessary quotes around the value in the command list, the corrected function should now correctly build the command list for the dictionary inputs as expected by the failing tests.
