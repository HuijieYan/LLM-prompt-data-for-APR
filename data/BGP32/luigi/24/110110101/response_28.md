### Analysis
- The buggy function `_dict_arg` takes in a `name` and `value` parameter, where `value` is expected to be a dictionary.
- The function iterates over the items in the dictionary and constructs a list `command` based on the key-value pairs.
- The bug seems to be related to the way the key-value pairs are being formatted in the `command` list.

### Error Cause
- The buggy function is formatting the key-value pairs in a way that includes unnecessary double quotes around the values.
- This causes a mismatch in the expected and actual values when comparing lists containing these formatted key-value pairs.

### Bug Fix Strategy
- Update the way key-value pairs are formatted in the `command` list to match the expected format without unnecessary double quotes around the values.

### Corrected Function
```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, '{0}={1}'.format(prop, val)]
    return command
``` 

By making the above changes to the `_dict_arg` function, the corrected version should now properly format the key-value pairs and pass the failing tests.
