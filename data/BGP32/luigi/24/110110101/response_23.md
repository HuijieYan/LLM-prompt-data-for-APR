### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_dict_arg` is designed to construct command arguments based on a dictionary input.
2. The bug is that the function adds an extra set of double quotes around the argument value when constructing the command. This leads to a mismatch in the expected and actual command list when comparing in the test.
3. The failing test shows that the command arguments are constructed with extra double quotes around values leading to assertion errors.
4. To fix the bug, we need to remove the unnecessary double quotes around the argument values before constructing the command list.

### Updated Buggy Function:
```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, '{0}={1}'.format(prop, val)]  # Removed unnecessary double quotes around value
    return command
```

By removing the unnecessary double quotes around the argument value in the `_dict_arg` function, the corrected version should now construct the command arguments correctly without additional quotes.

This updated version of the function should now pass both failing tests with the expected input/output values.
