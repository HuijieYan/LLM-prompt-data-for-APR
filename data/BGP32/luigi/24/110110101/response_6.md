### Analysis
1. The buggy function `_dict_arg` is intended to convert a dictionary into a list of command arguments.
2. The function is iterating over the dictionary items and adding them to the `command` list properly.
3. The bug is in the formatting of the command arguments where unnecessary double quotes are being added around the values.
4. This is causing the test cases to fail as the expected command arguments do not have the double quotes.

### Bug
The bug is in the line:
```python
command += [name, '"{0}={1}"'.format(prop, value)]
```
This line is adding unnecessary double quotes around the value, causing mismatches with the expected values in the test cases.

### Fix
To fix the bug, we need to remove the unnecessary double quotes from around the value when constructing the command list.

### Corrected Version
```python
class SparkSubmitTask(luigi.Task):
    """
    Template task for running a Spark job
    
    Supports running jobs on Spark local, standalone, Mesos or Yarn
    
    See http://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/submitting-applications.html
    for more information
    """

    def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
        command = []
        if value and isinstance(value, dict):
            for prop, val in value.items():
                command += [name, '{0}={1}'.format(prop, val)]
        return command
```

By removing the unnecessary double quotes, the corrected version of the function should now correctly format the command arguments and pass the failing test cases.
