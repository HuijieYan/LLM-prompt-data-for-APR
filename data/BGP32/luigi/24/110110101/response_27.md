### Analysis
1. The buggy function `_dict_arg` takes in a `name` and `value` as parameters and constructs a command list based on the key-value pairs in the input dictionary `value`.
2. The bug lies in the way the function constructs the key-value pairs in the command list. It is currently adding double quotes around the value, which is causing the assertion error in the test cases.
3. The failing tests are expecting the key-value pairs to be in a specific format without double quotes around the values. The bug causes the function to add unnecessary double quotes in the command list, leading to assertion errors.
4. To fix the bug, we need to remove the unnecessary double quotes around the values in the command list before returning it.

### Bug Fix Approach
1. Modify the function to construct the command list without adding double quotes around the values.
2. Ensure that the key-value pairs are formatted correctly in the command list.
3. Update the function to handle the dictionary input and construct the command list accordingly.

### Corrected Version of the Function
```python
class SparkSubmitTask(luigi.Task):
    """
    Template task for running a Spark job
    
    Supports running jobs on Spark local, standalone, Mesos or Yarn
    
    See http://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/submitting-applications.html
    for more information
    """

    def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
        command = []
        if value and isinstance(value, dict):
            for prop, val in value.items():  # Changed variable name from value to val to avoid conflict
                command += [name, '{}={}'.format(prop, val)]  # Construct command without double quotes
        return command
```

By removing the unnecessary double quotes around the values in the command list, the corrected function should now pass the failing tests and return the expected command list format.
