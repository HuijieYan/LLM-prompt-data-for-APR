### Analysis
1. The buggy function `_dict_arg` is supposed to take a `name` parameter and a `value` parameter which is expected to be a dictionary. It iterates through the dictionary, constructs a command list based on the key-value pairs, and returns the constructed list.
2. The buggy function is not handling the dictionary values correctly, resulting in extra quotes and formatting issues.
3. The failing test cases are failing due to the incorrect formatting of values in the command list compared to the expected values. The error messages indicate the differences in formatting within the command list specifically related to the values from the dictionaries.
4. To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the values from the dictionary are formatted correctly without unnecessary extra quotes and formatting.
5. The corrected version of the function is provided below:

### Corrected Version of the Function

```python
import luigi

class SparkSubmitTask(luigi.Task):
    def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
        command = []
        if value and isinstance(value, dict):
            for prop, val in value.items():
                command += [name, '{0}={1}'.format(prop, val)]
        return command
```

By using `format` directly without extra quotes around the values, we can ensure that the command list is constructed correctly. This correction should resolve the formatting issues and make the function behave as expected in the test cases.
