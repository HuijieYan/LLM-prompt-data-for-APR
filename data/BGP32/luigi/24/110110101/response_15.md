### Analysis
1. The buggy function `_dict_arg` is supposed to convert a dictionary into a list of command-line arguments. However, there are issues with the way each key-value pair is being formatted.
2. The issue arises from how the dictionary key-value pairs are being handled within the function.
3. The failing tests are comparing the actual output of the function with the expected command-line arguments, highlighting the discrepancies in formatting.
4. To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the key-value pairs from the dictionary are correctly formatted as command-line arguments.
5. We need to modify the way key-value pairs are processed to ensure they are correctly formatted as command-line arguments.

### Bug Fix
Here is the corrected version of the `_dict_arg` function:

```python
class SparkSubmitTask(luigi.Task):
    def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
        command = []
        if value and isinstance(value, dict):
            for prop, val in value.items():
                command += [name, '{0}={1}'.format(prop, val)]
        return command
```

By using `{0}` instead of `"{0}"`, we ensure that the key-value pairs are correctly formatted without additional quotes. This change should fix the bug and make the function work as expected in the test cases provided.
