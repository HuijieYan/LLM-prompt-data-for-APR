### Analysis
1. The buggy function `_dict_arg` in the `SparkSubmitTask` class is supposed to process a dictionary input and generate a list of command arguments based on the key-value pairs in the dictionary.
2. The function iterates over the key-value pairs in the input dictionary and appends the arguments to the `command` list.
3. The bug arises from the way the function constructs the arguments. It incorrectly includes double quotes around the property=value pair in the command list, leading to discrepancies in the expected output.
4. To fix the bug, the function should generate the arguments without enclosing the property=value pair in double quotes.


### Bug Explanation
- In the provided failing test, the `prop` argument's value is enclosed in double quotes when constructing the command list in the `_dict_arg` function.
- This results in the generated command list having some elements as strings enclosed in double quotes and others as plain strings, leading to a mismatch with the expected output.
- The bug causes the assertion to fail because the elements in the generated command list do not match the expected command list.
- To fix the bug, the `_dict_arg` function needs to construct the command list without adding double quotes around the property=value pairs.


### Bug Fix
```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, '{0}={1}'.format(prop, val)]  # Fix: Removed double quotes around {0}={1}
    return command
```

By removing the double quotes around the `{0}={1}` format in the `command` list construction, the fixed version of the function will correctly generate the command list without discrepancies in the elements.

This corrected version should now pass the failing tests with the expected input/output values. Make sure to replace the existing `SparkSubmitTask` class implementation with this fixed `_dict_arg` function.
