The buggy function `_dict_arg` is not handling the values of the dictionary input correctly. It is converting the dictionary key-value pairs to a list with key-value pairs encoded as strings, but it should directly append the key and value to the command list separately.

The bug is caused by the buggy function iterating over the dictionary values incorrectly, leading to the incorrect formatting of the arguments passed to the command list.

To fix the bug, we should modify the `_dict_arg` function to correctly iterate over the dictionary and append the key and value separately to the command list.

Here is the corrected version of the `_dict_arg` function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, prop, val]
    return command
```

This corrected version appends the key and value pairs separately to the `command` list, which should resolve the issue.

After applying this fix, the function should pass both failing test cases provided.
