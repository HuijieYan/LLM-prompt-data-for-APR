### Analysis
1. The `SparkSubmitTask` class contains a `_dict_arg` function that is intended to convert a dictionary to a list of command line arguments. However, the current implementation is incorrect.
2. The function iterates over the dictionary's items and incorrectly adds quotation marks to the property=value pair.
3. The failing tests indicate that the function is not correctly handling the conversion from a dictionary to a list of command line arguments.
4. To fix the bug, we need to remove the unnecessary quotation marks around the property=value pairs in the generated list of command line arguments.

### Bug Cause
The `_dict_arg` function is incorrectly formatting the property=value pairs by adding unnecessary quotation marks.

### Bug Fix
We need to modify the `_dict_arg` function to not include extra quotation marks around the property=value pairs.

### Corrected Code
```python
class SparkSubmitTask(luigi.Task):
    def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
        command = []
        if value and isinstance(value, dict):
            for prop, val in value.items():
                command += [name, '{0}={1}'.format(prop, val)]
        return command
```

By removing the quotation marks around the property=value pairs in the `command` list, the corrected function should now generate the correct list of command line arguments and pass the failing tests.
