### Analysis
1. The buggy function `_dict_arg` is designed to convert a dictionary into a list of command-line arguments.
2. The bug is caused by the function incorrectly handling values that are dictionary items. It is wrapping the dictionary values with double quotes, which is causing the assertion failures in the tests.
3. The failing tests are checking for specific command-line arguments and their values, but the buggy function is not generating the expected format for dictionary values.
4. To fix the bug, we need to modify the handling of dictionary values in the `_dict_arg` function to remove the unnecessary double quotes around the values.
5. We should fix the function to generate command-line arguments without unnecessary double quotes for dictionary values.

### Corrected Version

```python
class SparkSubmitTask(luigi.Task):
    """
    Template task for running a Spark job
    
    Supports running jobs on Spark local, standalone, Mesos or Yarn
    
    See http://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/submitting-applications.html
    for more information
    """

    def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
        command = []
        if value and isinstance(value, dict):
            for prop, val in value.items():
                command += [name, '{0}={1}'.format(prop, val)]
        return command
```

By removing the unnecessary double quotes around the values in the command list concatenation, we ensure that the command-line arguments are generated without unwanted formatting, which should resolve the assertion errors in the failing tests.
