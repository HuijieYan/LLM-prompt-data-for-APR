### Issue Analysis
The bug in the `_dict_arg` function stems from the fact that the current implementation incorrectly adds quotes around key=value pairs when constructing the command list. This results in a mismatch when comparing the expected command list with the actual command list in the test cases.

### Bug Cause
1. The function incorrectly formats key-value pairs as `"key=value"` with quotes around them, causing the actual command list to contain extra quotes.
2. This extra quoting causes the assertion in the test cases to fail as the expected command list doesn't include quotes around key=value pairs.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to modify the `_dict_arg` function to construct the command list without adding quotes around key-value pairs.

### Corrected Code
```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():  # avoid reusing variable name value
            command += [name, '{0}={1}'.format(prop, val)]
    return command
```

By making this change, the corrected `_dict_arg` function should now correctly format the key-value pairs without adding quotes, resolving the issue in the failing tests.
