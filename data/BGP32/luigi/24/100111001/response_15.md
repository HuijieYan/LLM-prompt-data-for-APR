### Bug Explanation
The bug in the `_dict_arg` function is caused by incorrectly handling the formatting of dictionary values for the command list. The function is converting the dictionary items into strings in a format that includes double quotes, leading to a mismatch with expected values in the test cases.

In Case 1, the dictionary item `{'Prop': 'Value'}` is being incorrectly converted to `'"Prop=Value"'` instead of `'Prop=Value'`. This discrepancy causes the assertion error in the test case because the expected value does not match the actual value due to the presence of unnecessary double quotes.

In Case 2, a similar issue occurs with the dictionary item `{'prop1': 'val1'}`, being converted inaccurately to `'"prop1=val1"'` instead of `'prop1=val1'`.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to modify the `_dict_arg` function to format the dictionary values without unnecessary double quotes. The function should directly concatenate the property and value pair without enclosing them in quotes.

### Corrected Version of the Function
```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, '{0}={1}'.format(prop, val)]
    return command
```

By modifying the function to format the dictionary items without double quotes, the corrected version should now properly handle dictionary values and pass the failing tests.
