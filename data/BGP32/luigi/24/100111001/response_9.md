### Bug Analysis
The bug is caused by the `_dict_arg` function incorrectly formatting dictionary values when constructing the `command` list. Instead of directly including the property and value pair without double quotes, it wraps the value within double quotes. This discrepancy causes the test cases to fail as the expected values in the test cases do not include double quotes around the property values.

### Bug Fix
To fix the bug, we should modify the `_dict_arg` function to include property-value pairs without double quotes when constructing the `command` list.

### Corrected Version of the `_dict_arg` Function
```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, '{}={}'.format(prop, val)]
    return command
``` 

By updating the function to use string formatting without quotes around values, we align the function with the expected output generated by the test cases and ensure the correct behavior of the SparkSubmitTask.
