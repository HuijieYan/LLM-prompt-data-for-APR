### Bug Explanation
The bug in the `_dict_arg` function lies in the way it handles the values of the dictionary passed as an argument. The function incorrectly adds double quotes around the values when constructing the command list. This results in a mismatch with the expected format in the test cases, leading to assertion errors.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to remove the unnecessary double quotes around the property values in the command list construction. This will ensure that the output format matches the expected format in the test cases.

### Corrected Version of the Function
```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, '{0}={1}'.format(prop, val)]
    return command
```

By making this change, the function will construct the command list without adding double quotes around the values. This corrected version should now pass the failing test cases.
