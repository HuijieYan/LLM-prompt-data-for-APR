### Bug in the Buggy Function
The bug in the `_dict_arg` function stems from how it handles the dictionary items passed to it. The function is adding quotation marks around the `value` portion of each key-value pair in the dictionary before appending it to the `command` list. This results in incorrect formatting when generating the command list, leading to assertion errors in the test cases.

### Bug Cause
The root cause of the bug is the unnecessary addition of double quotes around the `value` portion of each key-value pair in the dictionary. This causes the command list to contain incorrectly formatted elements, leading to assertion errors in the test cases due to mismatched values.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to modify the way the key-value pairs are added to the command list. Specifically, we should avoid adding unnecessary quotes around the `value` part of each pair. By removing the quotes, we can ensure that the command list is correctly formatted and matches the expected values from the test cases.

### Corrected Code
```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, '{0}={1}'.format(prop, val)]
    return command
```

By making this change, the corrected function will generate the command list without unnecessary quotes around the `value` part of the key-value pairs. This should address the formatting issue and allow the function to pass the failing test cases.
