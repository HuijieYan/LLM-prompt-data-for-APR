### Bug Analysis:
The bug in the `_dict_arg` function is related to how the values are being processed before being added to the `command` list. The function is incorrectly adding quotation marks around the property=value pair, leading to a mismatch with the expected format in the test cases.

### Bug Explanation:
1. In Case 1, the input dictionary is `{'Prop': 'Value'}` with `name` as `'--conf'`. However, the function adds double quotes around the property=value pair, resulting in `['--conf', '"Prop=Value"']`. This format mismatch causes the assertion error in the test.

2. In Case 2, the input dictionary is `{'prop1': 'val1'}` with `name` as `'--conf'`. Similar to Case 1, the function adds double quotes around the property=value pair, leading to `['--conf', '"prop1=val1"']`. This format difference causes the assertion failure in the test.

### Bug Fix:
To fix the bug, remove the extra double quotes around the property=value pairs before adding them to the `command` list. This adjustment will align the format correctly with the expected values in the test cases.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, '{0}={1}'.format(prop, val)]
    return command
``` 

By making this change, the function should now correctly format the properties and values without unnecessary double quotes, resolving the assertion errors in the failing test cases.
