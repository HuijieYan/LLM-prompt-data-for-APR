### Bug Explanation
The bug in the `_dict_arg` function is caused by the incorrect formatting of the arguments passed to the command list. The function is adding unnecessary double quotes around the property values when constructing the command list, leading to a mismatch when comparing the expected command list in the test cases. 

### Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to remove the unnecessary double quotes around the property values when constructing the command list in the `_dict_arg` function.

### Corrected Version of the Function
```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, "{0}={1}".format(prop, val)]  # Corrected formatting without double quotes
    return command
```

By making this change, the function will construct the command list correctly without unnecessary double quotes around the property values, fixing the bug and allowing the failing test cases to pass.
