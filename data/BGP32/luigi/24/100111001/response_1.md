### Bug Explanation
The bug in the `_dict_arg` function occurs due to how the function handles dictionary items when constructing the `command` list. The function is incorrectly adding double quotes around the property=value pair, causing the test cases to fail because the expected values do not include double quotes.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to modify the `_dict_arg` function to construct the `command` list without adding unnecessary double quotes around the property=value pairs.

### Corrected Version of the `_dict_arg` Function
Here is the corrected version of the `_dict_arg` function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, '{0}={1}'.format(prop, val)]
    return command
```

By removing the double quotes around the property=value pairs, the corrected function should now construct the `command` list correctly and pass the failing test cases.
