The bug in the `_dict_arg` function stems from the incorrect formatting of dictionary key-value pairs when constructing the command list. The function erroneously wraps the property and its value in double quotes which leads to discrepancies in the expected command list.

The bug causes the failing test to compare different command lists due to the presence of unnecessary double quotes around dictionary values, specifically when handling key-value pairs like `"Prop=Value"` instead of just `Prop=Value`.

To fix the bug, the function should construct the command list without unnecessary quotes around the property values. Here is the corrected version of the `_dict_arg` function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, '{0}={1}'.format(prop, val)]
    return command
```

By updating the function to correctly format the dictionary key-value pairs, the corrected version should now pass the failing tests provided.
