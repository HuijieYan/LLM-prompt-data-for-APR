The bug in the `_dict_arg` function is related to incorrectly handling values when constructing the command list. The issue stems from wrapping the values in double quotes `" "` when creating the command list, leading to discrepancies in the expected and actual output lists.

The function is adding double quotes around the property and value while constructing the command list for each key-value pair in the input dictionary. This results in a mismatch when comparing the expected list without quotes to the actual list with quotes.

To fix the bug, the function should construct the command list without adding double quotes around the property-value pairs.

Here is the corrected version of the `_dict_arg` function:
```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, '{0}={1}'.format(prop, val)]
    return command
```

With this correction, the function will properly generate the command list without double quotes around the property-value pairs, ensuring the correct comparison with the expected list in the test cases provided.
