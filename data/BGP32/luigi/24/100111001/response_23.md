### Analysis:
1. The `_dict_arg` function is designed to receive a name and a dictionary of properties to build a command list. It iterates over the dictionary items, formats the key-value pairs, and appends them to the command list.
2. The bug seems to be related to the formatting of the key-value pairs. The buggy function wraps the value within double quotes, which causes a mismatch between the expected and actual output in the test cases.
3. In both failing cases, the issue arises from the incorrect formatting of the key-value pairs. The expected format is `prop1=val1`, but the buggy function produces `'"prop1=val1"'` with unwanted double quotes around the value.
4. To fix the bug, we should remove the unnecessary double quotes when constructing the key-value pairs.
5. Below is the corrected version of the `_dict_arg` function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, '{0}={1}'.format(prop, val)]
    return command
``` 

By removing the double quotes around the formatted key-value pairs, the corrected function should now produce the expected output and pass the failing test cases.
