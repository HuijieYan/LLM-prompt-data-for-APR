### Bug Analysis:
The bug lies in the `_dict_arg` function where the values are being incorrectly formatted with extra double quotes around the values when constructing the command list.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is caused by the incorrect formatting of the key-value pairs in the `value.items()` loop. The buggy function adds extra double quotes around the values, causing the test cases to fail when comparing the expected command list.

### Bug Fix:
To fix the bug, we need to remove the extra double quotes around the values when constructing the command list in the loop.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, '{0}={1}'.format(prop, val)]
    return command
```

By removing the extra double quotes around the values in the command list, the corrected function will generate the command list in the expected format, resolving the bug and allowing the failing test cases to pass.
