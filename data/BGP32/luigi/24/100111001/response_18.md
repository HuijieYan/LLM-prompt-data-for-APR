### Error Analysis
The bug in the `_dict_arg` function lies in how it handles the dictionary values. The current implementation adds double quotes around the property and value when constructing the command list. This leads to discrepancies between the expected command list in the test cases and the actual command list generated by the function. The root cause of the failure is the unnecessary double quoting of property values.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to remove the unnecessary double quotes around the property values when constructing the command list. This fix should align the generated command list with the expected command list in the test cases, resolving the assertion errors.

### Corrected Version of the Function
```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, '{0}={1}'.format(prop, val)]
    return command
```

By removing the double quotes around `{0}={1}` in the format string, we ensure that the property values are not erroneously enclosed in quotes when constructing the command list. This corrected version should now pass the failing test cases.
