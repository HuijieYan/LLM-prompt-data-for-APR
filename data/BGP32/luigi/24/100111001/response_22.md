### Bug Explanation:
The bug in the `_dict_arg` function arises from the way it constructs the command list when processing a dictionary argument. The function incorrectly adds extra quotes around the property values, leading to a mismatch with the expected command in the test cases. This issue causes the test cases to fail when comparing the constructed command list with the expected command list due to the presence of unnecessary double quotes around the property values.

### Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to modify the `_dict_arg` function to correctly build the command list without adding unnecessary double quotes around the property values. This can be achieved by directly appending the property and its value to the command list without additional string formatting that includes quotes.

### Corrected Version of the `_dict_arg` Function:
```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, prop + '=' + val]
    return command
```

By making this adjustment, the function now correctly generates the command list without the extra double quotes around the property values, ensuring that the test cases will pass as expected.
