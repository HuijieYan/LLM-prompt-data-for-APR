### Bug Analysis
The bug in the `_dict_arg` function stems from the way the key-value pairs are being processed and added to the `command` list. The current implementation adds the key-value pairs as strings with double quotes around the values, causing discrepancies when comparing the expected output in the test cases.

In both failing test cases, the values are being wrapped in double quotes within the `command` list, causing the `AssertionError` when comparing the expected list with the actual list.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we should remove the double quotes around the values when constructing the `command` list in the `_dict_arg` function. This adjustment will align the output format with the expected format in the test cases, resolving the `AssertionError`.

### Corrected Code
```python
# The corrected version of the buggy function
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, '{0}={1}'.format(prop, val)]
    return command
```

By modifying the function to remove the quotes around the values before appending them to the `command` list, the corrected version should now pass both failing test cases without any `AssertionError`.
