### Bug Explanation
The bug in the `_dict_arg` function lies in how the key-value pairs from the dictionary are handled. Currently, the function incorrectly adds double quotes around the property-value pair, causing a mismatch with the expected output in the test cases. This is evident from the error messages showing a difference between the expected property-value pair format and the actual format with double quotes.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to remove the unnecessary double quotes around the property-value pair when constructing the command list. By formatting the property and value directly without quotes, we can align with the expected output in the test cases.

### Corrected Function
```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, '{0}={1}'.format(prop, val)]
    return command
```

By making this change, the function will construct the command list without adding double quotes around the property-value pairs, thus aligning with the expected output in the test cases. This corrected version of the function should now pass the failing tests.
