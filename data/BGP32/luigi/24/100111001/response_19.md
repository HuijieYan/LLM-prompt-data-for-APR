### Bug Analysis:

The issue occurs because the `_dict_arg` function is adding extra double quotes around the property-value pair when constructing the command list for each item in the dictionary. This extra quoting is causing the test cases to fail as the expected values do not match the actual values due to the presence of unnecessary double quotes.

### Bug Fix:

To remedy the bug, we should remove the unnecessary double quotes when constructing the command list for each property-value pair in the dictionary.

### Corrected Version of the Function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, "{0}={1}".format(prop, val)]
    return command
```

By making this adjustment, the corrected function will generate the command list without additional double quotes around property-value pairs, aligning with the expected output from the failing test cases.
