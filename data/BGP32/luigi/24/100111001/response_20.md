### Analysis:
The buggy function `_dict_arg` is supposed to generate command arguments from a dictionary input. The main issue lies in the way the function constructs the command list by adding elements like `"{0}={1}".format(prop, value)` inside double quotes. This leads to the final command list containing some elements within double quotes while others are not. This inconsistency causes the tests to fail when comparing expected command lists with the actual generated lists.

### Bug Cause:
The bug stems from the function appending key-value pairs within double quotes to the `command` list, resulting in differences when the expected and actual lists are compared. The mismatch between quoted and non-quoted values causes the `AssertionError` in the failing tests.

### Bug Fix:
To fix this bug, we need to ensure that all elements added to the `command` list are consistently formatted without additional double quotes. We should construct the command list as a sequence of strings without quote characters where it's not necessary. 

### Corrected Version:
```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, '{0}={1}'.format(prop, val)]
    return command
``` 

By removing the unnecessary double quotes around the `{0}={1}` format in the corrected version, we ensure that the command list is consistently formatted with no additional quotes. This modification should address the bug and make the function generate the correct command lists.
