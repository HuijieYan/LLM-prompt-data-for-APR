### Bug Explanation
The bug in the `_dict_arg` function arises from the fact that it wraps the dictionary values in double quotes when constructing the command list. This results in a discrepancy when comparing the expected command list in the test functions, as the expected values are not surrounded by double quotes.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to modify the `_dict_arg` function to construct the command list without wrapping the dictionary values in double quotes.

### Corrected Version of the Function
```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, '{0}={1}'.format(prop, val)]
    return command
```

By implementing the above corrected version of the `_dict_arg` function, it will accurately construct the command list without unnecessary double quotes around the dictionary values, allowing the test functions to compare the expected and actual command lists correctly.
