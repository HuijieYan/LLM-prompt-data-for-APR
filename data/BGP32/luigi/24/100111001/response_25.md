### Bug Explanation
The bug in the `_dict_arg` function is related to the way it handles dictionary values for building a command list. The function incorrectly adds double quotes around the values when constructing the command list, which results in the failing tests due to the mismatch in the string formatting.

In both cases provided, the function incorrectly adds double quotes around the property values when building the command list. This leads to a discrepancy between the expected command list in the test and the actual command list generated by the function. The failing tests are comparing the expected command list without double quotes against the actual command list with double quotes, causing the assertions to fail.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug in the `_dict_arg` function, we need to ensure that the property values are concatenated to the command list without surrounding them with double quotes. This will align the generated command list with the expected format in the test cases, allowing the assertions to pass successfully.

### Corrected Version of the `_dict_arg` Function
```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, '{0}={1}'.format(prop, val)]
    return command
```

By modifying the function to concatenate the property values directly without the double quotes, the function will align with the expected format specified in the failing tests. This correction should resolve the bug and make the failing tests pass successfully.
