### Bug Explanation
The bug in the `_dict_arg` function stems from improperly formatting the key-value pairs when creating the command list. The current implementation adds double quotes around the value part, leading to a mismatch with the expected format in the test cases. The test cases expect the key-value pairs to be in the format `key=value` without additional quotes.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, the function should construct the command list without adding quotes around the values. This adjustment will align the output format with the expected format in the test cases and resolve the assertion errors.

### Corrected Version of the Function
```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, '{0}={1}'.format(prop, val)]
    return command
```

By removing the double quotes around the value in the string formatting, the corrected version of the function will produce key-value pairs in the expected format. This change should address the issues identified in the failing test cases.
