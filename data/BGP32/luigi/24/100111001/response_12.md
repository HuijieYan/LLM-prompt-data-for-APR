### Issues in the buggy function:
1. The function is incorrectly enclosing the property-value pair in double quotes, leading to differing elements in the test results.
2. The function is not handling the string values correctly, resulting in an assertion error.

### Strategy for fixing the bug:
1. Remove the unnecessary double quotes around the property-value pair.
2. Ensure that the function properly constructs the command list without adding unnecessary characters.

### Corrected version of the function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, prop_value in value.items():
            command += [name, '{0}={1}'.format(prop, prop_value)]
    return command
```

After applying these changes, the function should properly build the command list without unnecessary double quotes, resolving the assertion errors in the failing tests.
