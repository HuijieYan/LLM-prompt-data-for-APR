### BUG ANALYSIS:

The function `_dict_arg` is intended to generate a command list based on a dictionary input. The bug arises from the function incorrectly adding double quotes around the property=value pairs within the command list. This causes a mismatch with the expected command list in the tests.

### POTENTIAL ERROR:

The bug in the `_dict_arg` function lies in the line where the property=value pair is added to the command list. The function formats the pair with double quotes around it, which is unnecessary and causes the assertion failures in the tests.

### BUG CAUSE:

1. The function is incorrectly adding double quotes around the property=value pairs while constructing the command list.
2. In Case 1, the value 'Value' within the dictionary is getting assigned to the variable 'value' in the loop, leading to a mismatch when constructing the command list.
3. In Case 2, a similar issue occurs where 'val1' is incorrectly formatted within double quotes in the command list.

### STRATEGY FOR BUG FIX:

To fix the bug, the function should construct the command list without adding unnecessary double quotes around the property=value pairs. This will ensure that the generated command list matches the expected command list in the tests.

### CORRECTED VERSION OF THE FUNCTION:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command.extend([name, '{0}={1}'.format(prop, val)])
    return command
```

By making this correction, the function will correctly generate the command list without unnecessary double quotes, resolving the assertion failures in the failing tests.
