### Bug Analysis
The bug in the `_dict_arg` function stems from the way it constructs the command list. Specifically, when iterating over the dictionary items, it incorrectly formats the values with double quotes, leading to a mismatch in the expected and actual command lists. This discrepancy arises from using `'"{0}={1}"'.format(prop, value)` inside the loop, which encloses the values in quotes.

### Bug Explanation
1. **Case 1:** In the first case, for the input `{'Prop': 'Value'}`, the function incorrectly adds `'"Prop=Value"'` to the command list. This results in the actual command list containing a string with quotes around the value, causing the test to fail.
2. **Case 2:** Similarly, in the second case, for the input `{'prop1': 'val1'}`, the function includes `'"prop1=val1"'` in the command list. This introduces a discrepancy with the test's expected command list.

### Bug Fix
To fix the bug, we need to adjust how the values are formatted when constructing the command list. Instead of enclosing the values in double quotes, we should directly concatenate the property and value without quotes.

### Corrected Function
```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, '{0}={1}'.format(prop, val)]
    return command
```

By making this change, the corrected function will properly format the command list without unnecessary quotes around the values, aligning it with the expected command lists in the test cases. This adjustment should resolve the failing tests.
