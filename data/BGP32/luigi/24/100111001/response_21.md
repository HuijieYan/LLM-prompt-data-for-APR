### Bug Analysis:
The bug in the `_dict_arg` function stems from how it appends the command list. It incorrectly adds double quotes around the property and value while constructing the command. This leads to a mismatch in the expected command structure and the actual constructed command, causing the test cases to fail.

### Bug Explanation:
1. In the first failing test, the value for `--conf` is expected to be `'Prop=Value'`, but the `_dict_arg` function incorrectly adds double quotes leading to `'"Prop=Value"'`.
2. In the second failing test, the value for `--conf` is expected to be `'prop1=val1'`, but the `_dict_arg` function incorrectly adds double quotes leading to `'"prop1=val1"'`.

The issue arises from the unnecessary addition of double quotes while formatting the key and value pairs, which causes a mismatch in the command construction.

### Bug Fix:
To fix the bug, we need to remove the unnecessary double quotes while constructing the command to match the expected structure.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, '{0}={1}'.format(prop, val)]
    return command
```
