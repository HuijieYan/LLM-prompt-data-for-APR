### Analysis:
The buggy function `_dict_arg` is intended to handle dictionary input and convert it to a list representing command-line arguments. However, the current implementation adds unnecessary double quotes around the values, leading to discrepancies in the expected output during the test cases. The fundamental issue lies in the line where the value is appended to the `command` list after formatting it with quotes. This results in the mismatch between expected and actual command list values.

### Bug Cause:
The bug arises because the `value` is being incorrectly formatted with quotes before appending to the `command` list. This causes the actual output to contain additional quotes, causing the test cases to fail.

### Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, the unnecessary double quotes should be removed from the formatting part of the value. This will ensure that the command list is generated correctly without additional quotation marks.

### Corrected Function:
```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, '{0}={1}'.format(prop, val)]
    return command
```

Applying this correction will result in the function generating the command list without enclosing the values in double quotes, addressing the discrepancy observed in the failing test cases.
