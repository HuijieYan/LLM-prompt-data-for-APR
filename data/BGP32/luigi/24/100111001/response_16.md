The bug in the `_dict_arg` function arises from the unnecessary formatting of the value inside the loop for dictionary items. The function incorrectly adds double quotes around the `value` in the format `"{0}={1}"` causing the test cases to fail when comparing the expected and actual lists.

To fix this bug, we need to remove the unnecessary double quotes around the formatted `value`. Here is the corrected version of the `_dict_arg` function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, "{0}={1}".format(prop, val)]
    return command
```

By removing the double quotes around the `{1}` placeholder in the format string, the function should now correctly generate the command list without unnecessary quotes around the values.

Once you replace the buggy function with the corrected version and rerun the failing test cases, they should pass without any assertion errors.
