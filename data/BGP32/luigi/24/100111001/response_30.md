### Bug Explanation
The bug in the `_dict_arg` function arises from the way it constructs the command list for dictionary arguments. The function incorrectly encloses the property-value pairs in double quotes when adding them to the command list. This leads to discrepancies in the expected and actual command list as observed in the failing tests.

In both cases, the function is treating the values from the dictionary as strings enclosed in double quotes. As a result, the expected command list in the test cases does not contain the property-value pairs in the correct format, leading to assertion errors.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to modify the `_dict_arg` function to correctly append the property-value pairs to the command list without enclosing them in double quotes. This will ensure that the property-value pairs are formatted correctly when constructing the command list.

### Corrected Function
```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, '{0}={1}'.format(prop, val)]
    return command
```

By making this change, the function will construct the command list with property-value pairs in the correct format, resolving the issues observed in the failing tests. After applying this correction, re-run the failing tests to verify that they now pass successfully.
