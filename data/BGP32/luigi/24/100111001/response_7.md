### Bug Explanation
In the `_dict_arg` function, the bug arises from the usage of double quotes `" "` around the property and value when creating the command list. This results in extra quotes being added to the command list, causing the test cases to fail as the expected command list doesn't match the actual command list due to these extra quotes.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, the unnecessary double quotes should be removed when constructing the command list in the `_dict_arg` function. By updating the logic to format the command list without the additional quotes, the function should behave correctly and pass the failing test cases.

### Corrected Version of the Function
```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, '{0}={1}'.format(prop, val)]  # Removed unnecessary quotes
    return command
``` 

By making this change, the function now formats the command list without unnecessary quotes, fixing the bug that caused the failing test cases.
