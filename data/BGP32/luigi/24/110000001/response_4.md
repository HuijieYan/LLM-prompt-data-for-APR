1. The buggy function `_dict_arg` is intended to build a command list based on a dictionary `value` provided as an argument. It checks if the `value` is a dictionary and then iterates over its key-value pairs to construct the command list. However, there are potential issues in the implementation that could lead to incorrect command generation.

2. One potential error location is in the line `for prop, value in value.items():`. Here, the variable `value` is used both as the input dictionary and as the loop variable, which can lead to unexpected behavior.

3. The cause of the bug is that the loop variable `value` shadows the input dictionary `value`, leading to incorrect command formatting. This is due to the reassignment of `value` within the loop.

4. To fix the bug, it is essential to use a different variable name for the loop variable to avoid shadowing the input dictionary. Additionally, it might be necessary to handle edge cases like what happens if the `value` parameter is not a dictionary.

5. Here is a corrected version of the `_dict_arg` function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, prop_value in value.items():
            command += [name, '"{0}={1}"'.format(prop, prop_value)]
    return command
``` 

By changing the loop variable name from `value` to `prop_value`, we prevent the shadowing issue and ensure correct command construction based on the dictionary provided. Additionally, we check if the `value` parameter is a dictionary before processing it to handle edge cases.
