## Analysis and Explanation:
The buggy function `_dict_arg` in the class `SparkSubmitTask` is supposed to create a command list based on the input dictionary `value`. However, there is a bug in the function where the variable `value` is being reassigned within the loop, causing unexpected behavior and incorrect command generation.

## Identified Issue:
The issue lies in the loop where the loop variable `value` is being used for both the dictionary key and value which leads to overwriting and incorrect command generation.

## Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix this bug, we need to use a different variable name for the values in the loop to avoid overwriting the loop variable and retain the original input dictionary `value`.

## Corrected Version:
```python
# The corrected version of the buggy function
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, prop_value in value.items():  # Use a different variable name for values
            command += [name, '"{0}={1}"'.format(prop, prop_value)]
    return command
```

By using a different variable name for the values in the loop (`prop_value`), we ensure that the loop variable `value` retains its original dictionary values, fixing the bug and generating the correct command list.
