The bug in the `_dict_arg` function lies in reusing the variable `value` within the for loop, which replaces the value passed as an argument to the function, causing unexpected behavior.

To fix the bug, rename the loop variable within the for loop to avoid conflict with the function argument. Here's the corrected version of the `_dict_arg` function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, '"{0}={1}"'.format(prop, val)]
    return command
```

By renaming the loop variable to `val` inside the for loop, we prevent overwriting the function argument `value`.
