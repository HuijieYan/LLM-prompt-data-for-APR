## Analysis:
The buggy function `_dict_arg()` takes a `name` and a `value` as parameters, checks if the `value` is a dictionary, and then builds a command list based on the keys and values in the dictionary.

## Error Location:
The buggy function has a potential error in the line where the command list is being built using `+=` operator. The issue lies in overwriting the `value` variable inside the loop which leads to unexpected behavior.

## Bug Cause:
The bug is caused by reusing the variable `value` for both the loop iteration value and the original function parameter value. This leads to the loop overwriting the original `value` passed to the function, affecting the final command generation.

## Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, rename the loop variable in the function to something other than `value` to avoid confusion and variable overwriting. This will ensure that the original function parameter `value` remains unchanged during the loop iteration.

## Corrected Version:
```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, prop_value in value.items():  # Rename the loop variable to avoid overwriting
            command += [name, '"{0}={1}"'.format(prop, prop_value)]
    return command
```
