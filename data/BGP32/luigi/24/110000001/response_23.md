The issue in the `_dict_arg` function is that the `value` variable is being overwritten within the loop, leading to unexpected behavior. The loop variable `value` is used to iterate over the dictionary items, but it is also used to store the value of the dictionary item within the loop. This causes the original `value` variable to be overwritten, which can lead to incorrect command building.

To fix this issue, you can rename the loop value variable to something else to avoid overwriting the original `value` variable. Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, prop_value in value.items(): # rename loop variable to prop_value
            command += [name, '"{0}={1}"'.format(prop, prop_value)]
    return command
```

By renaming the loop variable to `prop_value`, we ensure that the original `value` variable is not overwritten within the loop. This will prevent any unexpected behavior in command building.
