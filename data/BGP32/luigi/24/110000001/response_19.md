The issue with the `_dict_arg` function is that it overwrites the input `value` parameter within the loop, leading to unexpected behavior. The `value` parameter being overwritten within the loop body is causing the bug. To fix this bug, we can change the inner loop variable name to avoid overwriting the outer loop variable. 

Here is the corrected version of the `_dict_arg` function:

```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: luigi/contrib/spark.py

# The declaration of the class containing the buggy function
class SparkSubmitTask(luigi.Task):
    """
    Template task for running a Spark job
    
    Supports running jobs on Spark local, standalone, Mesos or Yarn
    
    See http://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/submitting-applications.html
    for more information
    """



    # corrected version of the _dict_arg function
    def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
        command = []
        if value and isinstance(value, dict):
            for prop, prop_value in value.items():  # Changed variable name here
                command += [name, '"{0}={1}"'.format(prop, prop_value)]
        return command
``` 

By changing the inner loop variable to `prop_value` in the corrected function, the bug where the `value` parameter being overwritten within the loop is fixed.
