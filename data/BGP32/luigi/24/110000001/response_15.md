## Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_dict_arg` is designed to construct a list of command arguments based on a dictionary.
2. The main issue in this function is that it overwrites the `value` parameter with a dictionary comprehension.
3. The cause of the bug is the reassignment of the variable `value` inside the loop, which leads to unexpected behavior when constructing the command list.
4. A strategy to fix this bug would be to use different variable names inside the loop to avoid conflicts and retain the original `value` parameter.
