The buggy function `_dict_arg` is intended to generate a list of command arguments based on the input dictionary `value`. However, there is a potential bug in this function due to reusing the variable name `value` in the loop that iterates over the dictionary items. This can lead to unexpected behavior as it overwrites the original `value` input parameter.

To fix this bug, we should use a different variable name in the loop to avoid conflicts with the original `value` parameter. Here is the corrected version of the `_dict_arg` function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():  # Use a different variable name to avoid conflicts
            command += [name, '"{0}={1}"'.format(prop, val)]
    return command
```

By changing the variable name in the loop from `value` to `val`, we prevent any conflicts with the original `value` parameter and correctly construct the command arguments list based on the dictionary's key-value pairs.
