The buggy function `_dict_arg` is intended to construct a command list for Spark job arguments based on input key-value pairs. However, there seems to be a bug in the function that may cause unexpected behavior or errors. 

The bug in the function is in the line `command += [name, '"{0}={1}"'.format(prop, value)]`. The issue lies in the formatting of the string where `{1}` should be replaced with `value[prop]` instead of `value`.

To fix this bug, we need to replace `value` with `value[prop]` in the line causing the bug.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, '"{0}={1}"'.format(prop, val)]
    return command
``` 

By making this simple change, we fix the bug in the `_dict_arg` function and ensure that the command list is constructed correctly for Spark job arguments.
