The issue with the `_dict_arg` function is that it is using the same variable name `value` for both the initial value and the inner loop value. This is causing the inner loop value to overwrite the initial value and leading to incorrect behavior.

Corrected version of the `_dict_arg` function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, prop_value in value.items():
            command += [name, '"{0}={1}"'.format(prop, prop_value)]
    return command
```

Explanation of the bug:
The bug was caused by reusing the variable `value` in the inner loop of the function. When the loop iterates over the dictionary items, the inner `value` variable overwrites the initial value passed to the function, leading to an incorrect command being generated.

Strategy for fixing the bug:
To fix the bug, you should use a different variable name for the inner loop value to avoid overwriting the initial value passed to the function. This will ensure that each key-value pair in the dictionary is processed correctly and added to the command list as expected.
