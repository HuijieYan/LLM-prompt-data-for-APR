### Analysis:
The provided buggy function `_dict_arg` within the `SparkSubmitTask` class is supposed to take a dictionary as input and convert it into a list of command line arguments. However, there are potential error locations in this function related to variable shadowing and concatenating strings within the list.

### Potential Error Locations:
1. The function parameter `value` is being reused within the function, which can lead to unexpected behavior due to shadowing.
2. The way of constructing the command list by concatenating strings might not result in the desired command format.

### Cause of the Bug:
The bug in this function arises from reusing the variable name `value` inside the loop, causing shadowing of the outer variable. This results in incorrect command list construction due to incorrect string concatenation.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to eliminate variable shadowing by using distinct names for the inner loop variable. Additionally, we need to properly format the command string in the desired format for command line arguments.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, '"{0}={1}"'.format(prop, val)]
    return command
```

In the corrected version, the variable name `value` inside the loop has been renamed to `val` to avoid shadowing issues. The command string is formatted correctly for command line arguments.
