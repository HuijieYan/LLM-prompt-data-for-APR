The buggy function `_dict_arg` is intended to generate command arguments for a Spark job based on a dictionary of properties and values. However, there are potential errors in the function that need to be addressed:

1. The function is overwriting the `value` variable used in the loop to iterate over the dictionary `value.items()`. This can cause unexpected behavior and errors.
2. The use of double quotes around the key-value pairs in the command argument may not be necessary and can lead to issues when actually executing the command.

To fix the buggy function `_dict_arg`, we need to rename the loop variables to avoid conflicts and remove the unnecessary double quotes:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, "{0}={1}".format(prop, val)]
    return command
```

In the corrected version, we have renamed the loop variable `value` to `val` to prevent conflicts. We have also removed the double quotes around the key-value pairs in the command argument to ensure the correct formatting.
