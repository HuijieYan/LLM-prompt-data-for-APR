## Corrections made:

1. The buggy function `_dict_arg` had a naming conflict with the input parameters. The parameter `value` was used both as a dictionary value and iterator variable inside the loop. This caused the function to overwrite the dictionary value with the loop variable and produce incorrect output.
2. In the loop, creating arguments for the command should concatenate the strings like `"{0}={1}"` without the additional quotes to ensure correct formatting of the command.
3. The `return command` statement would return a list of command args, but it was not correctly appending the arguments as expected.

## Correction strategy:
1. Rename the iterator variable in the loop to avoid the naming conflict with the dictionary value.
2. Correct the formatting of the command arguments to properly generate the command string.
3. Instead of appending a list, concatenate the command arguments as strings in a single list.

## Corrected version:

```python
class SparkSubmitTask(luigi.Task):
    """
    Template task for running a Spark job
    
    Supports running jobs on Spark local, standalone, Mesos or Yarn
    
    See http://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/submitting-applications.html
    for more information
    """

    def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
        command = []
        if value and isinstance(value, dict):
            for prop, prop_value in value.items():
                command.append("{0}={1}".format(prop, prop_value))
        return [name] + command
```

In the corrected version, the loop variable `prop_value` is used to avoid conflicts with the input dictionary values. The command arguments are formatted correctly without extra quotes, and the command is constructed by concatenating the strings correctly. The corrected function now returns a list with the command arguments properly formatted and appended.
