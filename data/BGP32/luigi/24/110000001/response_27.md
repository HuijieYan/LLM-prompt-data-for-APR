        if value and isinstance(value, dict):
            for prop, val in value.items():  # Changed variable name from value to val to avoid conflicting names

        return command
```

Explanation:
The bug in the original function `_dict_arg` was caused by using the same variable name `value` in the loop for iterating over the dictionary items as well as the function argument. This led to unexpected behavior when accessing the dictionary values. By renaming the loop variable to `val`, we avoid the conflict and correctly construct the command list.

Strategy for fixing the bug:
1. Rename the loop variable within the loop that iterates over the dictionary items to a different name to avoid conflict with the function argument.
2. Update the references to use the renamed loop variable in constructing the command list.
