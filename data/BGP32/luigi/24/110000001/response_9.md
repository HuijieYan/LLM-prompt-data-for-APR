The buggy function `_dict_arg` is designed to generate command line arguments by iterating over a dictionary and constructing strings in the format `name "prop=value"` to be passed as arguments to a Spark job.

However, there is a bug in the function where the variable used in the loop (`value`) is being overwritten by the loop iteration variable. This leads to unexpected behavior and incorrect arguments being generated.

To fix this bug, we need to use different variable names within the loop to avoid overwriting the input parameter `value`. Here is the corrected version of the `_dict_arg` function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, prop_value in value.items():  # Use prop_value to avoid overwriting the input value
            command += [name, '"{0}={1}"'.format(prop, prop_value)]
    return command
```

By using a different variable name `prop_value` within the loop, we can retain the original value provided as input to the function and construct the command line arguments correctly.
