## Analysis:
The buggy function `_dict_arg` is intended to generate a command list based on the input dictionary `value`. It iterates over the key-value pairs in the dictionary and constructs the command list with the key-value pairs formatted as strings. However, there are potential issues in the current implementation that can cause bugs.

## Error Locations:
1. The variable `value` is being overwritten in the loop, which can cause unexpected behavior.
2. The generated command list may not be formatted correctly for command-line arguments.
3. Empty dictionaries might not be handled correctly.

## Bug Cause:
The bug in the current implementation is that the loop variable `value` is being overwritten with the inner loop value. This behavior can lead to unexpected results and incorrect command generation. Additionally, the formatting of the key-value pairs as command-line arguments may not be correct. Empty dictionaries are not handled properly as well.

## Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
1. Change the variable names in the loop to avoid overwriting the loop counter.
2. Properly format the key-value pairs as command-line arguments.
3. Handle the case when the input dictionary is empty.

## Corrected Version:
```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, '--{0} {1}'.format(prop, val)]
    return command
```

In the corrected version:
1. Changed the inner loop variable name to `val` to avoid overwriting the loop counter.
2. Formatted the key-value pairs with double dashes (`--`) for command-line arguments.
3. Added a check to handle the case when the input dictionary is empty.
