## Analysis:
The buggy function `_dict_arg` is intended to convert a dictionary of properties into command line arguments. However, there are errors in the implementation that prevent it from working correctly. The function is supposed to iterate over the key-value pairs in the dictionary, format them as a command line argument, and append them to the `command` list.

## Potential Error Locations:
1. The use of the same variable `value` in the loop iterator and the if condition can lead to confusion and errors.
2. The formatting of the command line argument is incorrect within the loop.

## Cause of the Bug:
The bug emerges from the fact that the loop variable `value` of the `for` loop is colliding with the input parameter `value`, leading to incorrect processing and formatting of the dictionary key-value pairs.

## Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix this bug, the loop variable name should be changed to something other than `value` to avoid confusion. Additionally, the formatting of command line arguments needs to be corrected to ensure successful conversion of dictionary properties.

## Corrected Version:
```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
        command = []
        if value and isinstance(value, dict):
            for key, val in value.items():
                command += [name, '{0}={1}'.format(key, val)]
        return command
```
