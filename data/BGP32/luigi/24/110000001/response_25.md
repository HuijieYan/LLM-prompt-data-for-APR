The bug in the `_dict_arg` function lies in the reusing of the variable name `value` within the loop iterating over the dictionary. This causes the original `value` argument to be overwritten, leading to incorrect behavior.

To fix this bug, we need to use a different variable name in the loop to avoid overwriting the original `value` argument. Here's the corrected version of the `_dict_arg` function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, prop_value in value.items():
            command += [name, '"{0}={1}"'.format(prop, prop_value)]
    return command
```

By changing the assignment from `for prop, value in value.items()` to `for prop, prop_value in value.items()`, we avoid overwriting the original `value` argument and correctly construct the command list using the dictionary properties.
