1. The buggy function `_dict_arg` is within the `SparkSubmitTask` class, which is a template task for running a Spark job.

2. There are a few potential error locations within the `_dict_arg` function:
   - The function takes `name` and `value` as parameters but reuses the variable `value` in the loop.
   - When constructing the command list, the string formatting may not be correctly handled for the key-value pair.

3. The cause of the bug lies in the way the key-value pairs from the dictionary are formatted and appended to the command list. The existing implementation concatenates the key with the value without proper formatting.

4. To fix the bug, we need to correct the way the key-value pairs are formatted and appended to the command list. We should use proper string formatting for each key-value pair in the dictionary.

5. Here's the corrected version of the `_dict_arg` function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command.append(f'{name} {prop}={val}')
    return command
```

In this corrected version, each key-value pair from the dictionary is formatted properly as `{name} {prop}={val}` before adding it to the `command` list.
