## Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_dict_arg` is supposed to handle dictionary arguments and convert them into a list of command arguments.
2. The potential error lies in the way the arguments are being concatenated to the `command` list within the loop.
3. The cause of the bug is that the arguments are not being correctly formatted when adding to the `command` list, which may result in incorrect command arguments when used later.
4. To fix the bug, we need to modify the way the arguments are concatenated to ensure they are formatted correctly.

## Correction:

```python
import luigi

class SparkSubmitTask(luigi.Task):
    """
    Template task for running a Spark job
    
    Supports running jobs on Spark local, standalone, Mesos or Yarn
    
    See http://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/submitting-applications.html
    for more information
    """

    def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
        command = []
        if value and isinstance(value, dict):
            for prop, val in value.items():  # Use a different variable name to avoid shadowing
                command += [name, '{0}={1}'.format(prop, val)]  # Update format to remove unnecessary quotes
        return command
```

In the corrected version, we have updated the way the arguments are concatenated to the `command` list by removing the unnecessary quotes around the arguments and using a different variable name `val` inside the loop to avoid shadowing the outer variable `value`.
