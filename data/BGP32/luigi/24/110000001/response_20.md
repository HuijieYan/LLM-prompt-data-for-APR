The buggy function `_dict_arg` is intended to convert a dictionary into a list of command arguments. However, there are several issues with the implementation that need to be addressed:

1. The variable `value` is being reused within the function, causing conflicts and potentially unexpected behavior.
2. The check `if value and isinstance(value, dict):` is not sufficient to ensure that `value` is a non-empty dictionary.
3. The formatting of the command arguments is incorrect and may lead to errors when constructing the final command.

To fix these issues, the function can be modified as follows:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, '{0}={1}'.format(prop, val)]
    return command
```

In this corrected version:
- The variable `value` used in the loop is renamed to `val` to avoid conflicts.
- The check for an empty dictionary is removed since the loop will handle the case where `value` is an empty dictionary.
- The formatting of the command arguments is simplified to avoid unnecessary quotes.

By making these changes, the function should now correctly convert a dictionary into a list of command arguments without causing conflicts or formatting issues.
