## Analysis:
- The buggy function `_dict_arg` is part of the `SparkSubmitTask` class in a file named `luigi/contrib/spark.py`.
- The function is intended to create a list of command arguments based on a dictionary passed as `value`.

## Identified Issues:
- The variable used for iterating over the dictionary is named `value`, which is the same name as the input parameter. This can lead to unexpected behavior and errors.
- The command is not properly formatted for use in a shell command, especially when dealing with spaces or special characters in the dictionary values.

## Cause of the Bug:
- The `_dict_arg` function incorrectly assigns the same name `value` to both the loop variable and the input parameter, causing confusion and potential errors when constructing the command.
- The format used to generate command arguments is not appropriate for a shell command, leading to incorrect command construction.

## Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
1. Change the name of the loop variable in the `for` loop to avoid conflicts with the input parameter.
2. Use a proper format for building shell command arguments to handle spaces and special characters correctly.

## Corrected Version:

```python
# The corrected version of the _dict_arg function
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, '--{0}="{1}"'.format(prop, val)]
    return command
```

In the corrected version:
- Changed the loop variable name to `val` to avoid conflicts with the input parameter.
- Modified the format to use `--` for each property and properly handle shell command arguments with spaces using `--{0}="{1}"`.
