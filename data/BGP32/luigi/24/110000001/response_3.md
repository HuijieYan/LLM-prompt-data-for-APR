## Analysis:
The buggy function `_dict_arg` in the `SparkSubmitTask` class is supposed to process a dictionary input and build a command list. However, there are issues with how the command list is constructed and generated which leads to incorrect behavior.

## Error Locations:
1. The command list is not properly constructed for each key-value pair in the input dictionary.
2. The formatting of key-value pairs to be added to the command list is incorrect.
3. There is no handling for the case when the input value is not a dictionary.

## Cause of the Bug:
The bug arises from the incorrect way key-value pairs are processed and added to the command list. The string formatting for key-value pairs is not accurate, resulting in a faulty command list generation.

## Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to correct the way key-value pairs are added to the command list. Proper formatting should be used while constructing the command list. Additionally, we should consider handling cases where the input value is not a dictionary.

## Corrected Version:
```python
# The corrected version of the function
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for key, val in value.items():
            command += [name, '{0}={1}'.format(key, val)]
    return command
```

In the corrected version, the key-value pairs are correctly formatted and added to the command list. The function now iterates through the dictionary properly and constructs the command list accordingly. It also handles the case where the input value is not a dictionary.
