## Analysis:
The buggy function `_dict_arg` in the `SparkSubmitTask` class is attempting to generate a list of command line arguments based on a dictionary provided as input. The function is supposed to iterate over the key-value pairs in the dictionary and add them to the `command` list in the format `name "prop=value"`. However, there are potential issues in how the command elements are being constructed and concatenated.

## Identifying Potential Errors:
1. The loop variable `value` is reused for both the outer loop (properties) and inner loop (values), which can lead to unexpected behavior.
2. The loop concatenation `command += [name, ...]` may not build the command list correctly.
3. The format string `"prop=value"` does not seem to match the desired output format.

## Bug Explanation:
The bug arises from how the loop is constructed and how the values are added to the `command` list. The use of the same variable `value` for both outer and inner loop is causing confusion. Additionally, the construction of the command elements using a list concatenation may not create the desired format.

## Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Use separate variable names for the outer and inner loops to avoid confusion.
2. Modify the command element concatenation to ensure the correct format and order.

## Corrected Version:
```python
class SparkSubmitTask(luigi.Task):
    """
    Template task for running a Spark job
    
    Supports running jobs on Spark local, standalone, Mesos, or Yarn
    
    See http://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/submitting-applications.html
    for more information
    """

    def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
        command = []
        if value and isinstance(value, dict):
            for prop, val in value.items():  # Use distinct variable names
                command += [name, "{0}={1}".format(prop, val)]  # Adjust format string
        return command
```

In the corrected version, the loop variables have been renamed to avoid confusion, and the format string has been modified to match the desired output format. The concatenation of command elements now correctly adds the key-value pairs to the `command` list.
