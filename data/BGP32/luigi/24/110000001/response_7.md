The issue in the `SparkSubmitTask` class's `_dict_arg` method is that the loop variable `value` is repeated, which overwrites the input value for the dictionary. This causes unexpected behavior when iterating over the dictionary items.

To fix this bug, we need to change the loop variable name from `value` to something else to avoid conflict with the function argument `value`.

Here is the corrected version of the `_dict_arg` method:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():  # Change the loop variable name from 'value' to 'val'
            command += [name, '"{0}={1}"'.format(prop, val)]
    return command
```

By changing the loop variable name to `val`, we ensure that it does not conflict with the function argument `value`, and the method will now correctly iterate over the dictionary items without overwriting the input value.
