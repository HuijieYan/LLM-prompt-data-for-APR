The potential error in the `_dict_arg` function is that the variable `value` is being used as both the input parameter and as the loop variable inside the loop. This can cause unexpected behavior since the original `value` is being overwritten by the loop iteration.

To fix this bug, we should use a different variable name for the loop iteration. Additionally, we should check if the `value` is not `None` before iterating through the dictionary.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, '"{0}={1}"'.format(prop, val)]
    return command
```

By using a different variable name (`val`) for the loop iteration and ensuring that `value` is not `None` before iterating through the dictionary, we can avoid overwriting the original value and handle the dictionary properly.
