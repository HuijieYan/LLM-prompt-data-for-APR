Potential Error Location:
The potential error lies in the way the arguments are being added to the command list in the `_dict_arg` function. The current implementation might not correctly format the arguments as expected.


Cause of Bug:
The bug stems from the way the dictionary arguments are being added to the command list. The current implementation tries to concatenate the key and value as a string, which may not be the correct format required for the SparkSubmitTask.


Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to properly format the dictionary arguments before adding them to the command list. We should separate the key and value with an equal sign without additional quotes.


Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
    def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
        command = []
        if value and isinstance(value, dict):
            for prop, val in value.items():
                command += [name, "{0}={1}".format(prop, val)]
        return command
```

In the corrected version, we iterate over the dictionary items and format them correctly with the key separated by an equal sign from the value without additional quotes. This should ensure that the arguments are formatted correctly for the SparkSubmitTask.
