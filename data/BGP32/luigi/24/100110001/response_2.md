1. The `self._dict_arg` function has an issue with how it constructs the command list. It's adding double quotes around the property value pair in the format `{prop}="{value}"`, which is causing a mismatch with the expected output in the failing test cases.

2. The potential error location is in the line `command += [name, '"{0}={1}"'.format(prop, value)]`.

3. The bug is caused by adding double quotes around the values in the command list, resulting in a mismatch with the expected value in the test cases. The error message clearly shows the difference between the expected list and the actual list, highlighting the issue with the formatting of property value pairs.

4. To fix the bug, we need to remove the double quotes around the value when constructing the command list. This will align the output with the expected values in the test cases.

5. Below is the corrected version of the `_dict_arg` function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, '{0}={1}'.format(prop, val)]
    return command
```

By using the corrected version of the function above, the issue with adding unnecessary double quotes around the property value pairs is resolved. This updated function will align the output with the expected values in the failing test cases, and the tests should pass successfully.
