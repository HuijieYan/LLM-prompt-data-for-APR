### Analysis:
1. The `_dict_arg` function is supposed to take a dictionary `value` as an input and return a list of formatted arguments for a command. However, the bug in the function is causing it to incorrectly format the dictionary values.
2. The failing tests showcase the discrepancies between the expected command list and the actual command list generated by the `_dict_arg` function.
3. The error message indicates that for dictionary entries like `--conf`, the formatting is incorrect, leading to a mismatch in the generated command compared to the expected command.
4. The bug is likely due to the incorrect formatting of dictionary values within the loop of the function. The current implementation wraps the values in double quotes, which is unnecessary and leads to errors in the test cases.
5. The strategy for fixing the bug involves correctly formatting the dictionary values without unnecessary quotes in the `_dict_arg` function.

### Fixed Version:
```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, '{0}={1}'.format(prop, val)]
    return command
```

In the corrected version of the `_dict_arg` function, the unnecessary double quotes around the values have been removed. This should ensure that the command list is generated correctly and matches the expected commands in the test cases.
