### Analysis:
The `_dict_arg` function is intended to convert a dictionary into a list of command arguments. The issue lies in the way the function handles converting key-value pairs from the dictionary to strings. It incorrectly wraps both the key and value in double quotes when creating the argument. This causes the discrepancy in the expected and actual test results.

### Potential Error Location:
The error is caused by the incorrect formatting of the key-value pairs in the resulting command list. The function combines the argument name, key, and value with extra double quotes which leads to differences when compared with the expected list.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is caused by the unnecessary double quotes wrapping both the key and value pair while creating the command list. As a result, the expected and actual command lists do not match when compared during the test execution.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix this bug, we need to remove the unnecessary double quotes around the key-value pairs when generating the command list. This will align the actual result with the expected result and allow the test case to pass successfully.

### Corrected Version with Bug Fix:
```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, value in value.items():
            command += [name, '{0}={1}'.format(prop, value)]
    return command
```

By making this change, the key-value pairs from the dictionary will now be correctly formatted without the extra double quotes, ensuring that the actual command list matches the expected list during the test execution.
