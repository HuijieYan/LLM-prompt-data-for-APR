### Analysis:
- The buggy function `_dict_arg` is designed to process a dictionary input and create a command list based on the key-value pairs present in the dictionary. The function iterates over the dictionary items, concatenates the required format and adds it to the `command` list.
- The error messages in both failing tests indicate a difference in handling the key-value pairs within the command list. In the first test, the value is enclosed in double quotes (`"Prop=Value"`), while in the second test, it is not (`'prop1=val1'`).
- The discrepancy arises due to how the function formats the key-value pairs while constructing the command list.

### Fix Strategy:
- To resolve the issue, we need to ensure consistent formatting of the key-value pairs within the command list. Instead of adding quotes around the value, the function should append the key and value directly without any special formatting.

### Updated Corrected Function:
```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, '{0}={1}'.format(prop, val)]
    return command
```

By updating the function to remove the extra quotation marks around the values, the corrected version should handle key-value pairs correctly and align with the expectations in the failing tests.
