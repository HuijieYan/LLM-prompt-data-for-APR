## Analysis
The buggy function `_dict_arg` is supposed to create a command list based on the provided dictionary `value`. The function is currently adding extra quotes around the values in the command list, leading to a mismatch with the expected command list in the failing tests.

## Error Location
The bug is in the line:
```python
command += [name, '"{0}={1}"'.format(prop, value)]
```
Here, unnecessary quotes are added to the value passed to the command list, causing discrepancies in the test cases.

## Bug Cause
The bug is caused by the unnecessary addition of quotes around the `value` when creating the command list. This results in the actual command list having additional quote characters that are not present in the expected command list, leading to failing tests.

## Strategy for Fixing the Bug
To fix the bug, we need to remove the extra quotes when adding the values to the command list. This can be achieved by directly formatting the string without adding additional quotes.

## Corrected Version of the Function
```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, '{0}={1}'.format(prop, val)]
    return command
```

In the corrected version, the extra quotes around `{0}={1}` have been removed, ensuring that the values are added to the command list without additional quotes. This modification will align the actual command list with the expected command list in the test cases, resolving the bug.
