### Analysis:
1. The `_dict_arg` function is designed to handle dictionary-like arguments passed to it and convert them into a command list.
2. The failing tests indicate that there are inconsistencies in how the function processes dictionary values.
3. The key issue is how the function handles string formatting for dictionary values inside the command list creation.
4. The error is caused by the function wrapping the dictionary value in double quotes unnecessarily, leading to the assertion failure.

### Bug Cause:
The `_dict_arg` function mistakenly wraps certain values in double quotes before appending them to the command list, resulting in incorrect comparison during the test assertion.

### Bug Fix:
We need to modify the `_dict_arg` function to handle dictionary values without adding unnecessary double quotes around them. Below is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, '--{0}={1}'.format(prop, val)]
    return command
```

With this corrected version, the function will correctly format dictionary values without adding extra quotes.

### Final Output:
After applying the bug fix and using the corrected version of the `_dict_arg` function, the failing tests should pass without any assertion errors.
