### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_dict_arg` iterates over a dictionary, creates a string with format `"{prop}={value}"`, and appends it to a list.
2. The test code calls the function with a dictionary where keys and values are passed as strings enclosed in double quotes.
3. The error message shows that the function is adding the format string with double quotes to the command list, causing a mismatch when comparing lists in the test.
4. The bug occurs because the `_dict_arg` function is including the double quotes in the generated command list, which is not expected by the test.
5. Strategy for fixing the bug:
   - Adjust the `_dict_arg` function to exclude the double quotes when creating the command list.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            # Exclude double quotes around the value in command generation
            command += [name, "{0}={1}".format(prop, val)]
    return command
```

By removing the double quotes from the generated command list in the `_dict_arg` function, the corrected version will now generate the command list without the extra quotes. This change will ensure that the function behaves as expected by the test, resolving the mismatch in list comparison and passing the failing test.
