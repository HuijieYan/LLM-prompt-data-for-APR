### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_dict_arg` is meant to process a dictionary and create a list of arguments based on the key-value pairs in the dictionary.
2. The failing tests are checking if the arguments generated by the `_dict_arg` function match the expected arguments list.
3. The error message for both failing tests indicates that there is a difference in how the arguments are being processed and formatted in the generated list.
4. The issue seems to be with the string formatting for key-value pairs in the generated list. It is currently adding unnecessary quotation marks around the values.

### Bug:
The bug is in the `_dict_arg` function where it incorrectly formats the key-value pairs with quotation marks around the values. This causes the generated list of arguments to be different from the expected list.

### Fix:
To fix the bug, we need to modify the function to include the key-value pairs without unnecessary quotation marks around the values.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, prop_value in value.items():
            command += [name, '{0}={1}'.format(prop, prop_value)]
    return command
```

By removing the extra quotation marks from the format string, we ensure that the key-value pairs are correctly formatted into the list of arguments without any additional characters.
