### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_dict_arg` is supposed to receive a dictionary of arguments and convert it into a list of command-line arguments in the format `[name, "prop=value"]`.
2. The failing tests are checking the result of the `_dict_arg` function against an expected list of arguments, and the tests fail due to differences in the formatted strings of the dictionary values.
3. The error message indicates that there is a mismatch between expected and actual values due to the formatting string issue.
4. The bug is in the way the dictionary values are being formatted with double quotes around them.
5. The strategy for fixing the bug is to remove the double quotes from around the values of dictionary items when formatting them into command-line arguments.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, value in value.items():
            command += [name, "{0}={1}".format(prop, value)]
    return command
```

After removing double quotes around the `{1}` placeholder in `{0}={1}` format, the corrected version of `_dict_arg` function should now properly format the dictionary values and pass the failing tests.
