### Analysis:
1. The `_dict_arg` function is expected to convert a dictionary into a list of command-line arguments.
2. The failing tests are checking if the correct list of arguments is being generated based on the input dictionary.
3. In both error messages, the difference is due to the presence of double quotes around certain values like `Prop=Value` which should not be quoted according to the test cases.
4. The bug lies in the function placing unnecessary double quotes around values when generating the command list.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to modify the function to not wrap values with double quotes unless they are necessary for the command-line arguments. The function should handle the generation of command-line arguments based on the input dictionary properly.

### Corrected Function:
```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            if isinstance(val, str) and ' ' in val:
                command += [name, '{0}="{1}"'.format(prop, val)]
            else:
                command += [name, str(prop), str(val)]
    return command
```

### Summary:
The corrected function now properly generates the command list based on the input dictionary, handling cases where double quotes are not necessary for values like `Prop=Value`. This modification should resolve the issue with the failing test cases.
