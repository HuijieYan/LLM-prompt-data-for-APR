### Analysis:
1. The function `_dict_arg` takes in a `name` and a `value` which is expected to be a dictionary.
2. The function iterates over the dictionary and adds formatted key-value pairs to a `command` list.
3. The issue arises from formatting the key-value pair incorrectly by enclosing the value in double quotes.
4. This incorrect formatting leads to a difference in the lists during comparison causing the test to fail.

### Error Cause:
The cause of the bug is the unnecessary use of double quotes around the value when formatting the key-value pairs in the command list.

### Change Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to modify the logic of formatting key-value pairs by not enclosing the value in double quotes unnecessarily.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, "{0}={1}".format(prop, val)]
    return command
```

The corrected version removes the unnecessary double quotes around the value while formatting the key-value pairs. This change should resolve the issue and make the function work correctly with the provided tests.
