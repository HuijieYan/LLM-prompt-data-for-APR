## Analysis:
The buggy function `_dict_arg` is supposed to convert a dictionary into a list of strings following a specific format. However, the current implementation adds unnecessary double quotes around the `{prop=value}` pairs, leading to a mismatch with the expected command list.

The failing tests `test_run` and `test_defaults` are checking the command arguments by comparing them with the expected command list. The error message from both failing tests indicates a discrepancy in how the `prop=value` pairs are formatted, with one containing double quotes and the other not.

## Bug Cause:
The bug is caused by the unnecessary addition of double quotes around `{prop=value}` pairs when converting the dictionary to command arguments. This formatting difference leads to the assertion errors in the failing tests.

## Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to modify the `_dict_arg` function to format the `prop=value` pairs without adding double quotes around them. By removing the quotes, the resulting command will match the expected command list in the tests.

## Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, value in value.items():
            command += [name, '--{0}={1}'.format(prop, value)]
    return command
```

By updating the `_dict_arg` function to use `'--{0}={1}'.format(prop, value)` format instead of `'{0}="{1}"'.format(prop, value)`, we will ensure that the `prop=value` pairs are formatted correctly without unnecessary double quotes.

With this correction, the function should now generate command arguments that match the expected command lists in the failing test cases.
