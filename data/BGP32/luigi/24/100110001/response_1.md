There are two failing tests provided, both related to the function `_dict_arg` in the `spark.py` file. The main issue with the function is that it is incorrectly formatting the dictionary values by adding double quotes around the values before appending them to the `command` list. This leads to a discrepancy in the comparison between the expected output and the actual output.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Check the function `_dict_arg` to ensure it correctly formats the dictionary values.
2. Remove unnecessary double quoting around the values.
3. Ensure that each key-value pair from the dictionary is added to the `command` list correctly without any additional formatting.

### Corrected Version of the Function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, '{0}={1}'.format(prop, val)]
    return command
```

The corrected version of the function removes the unnecessary double quotes when constructing the command list based on the dictionary values.

By implementing this change, the provided tests should pass without any assertion errors.
