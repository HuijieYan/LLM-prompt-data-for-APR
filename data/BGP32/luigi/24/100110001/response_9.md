### Analysis:
- The `_dict_arg` function is not handling dictionary values correctly, resulting in the mismatch between the expected list and the actual list in the failing test.
- The issue seems to be caused by incorrectly formatting the dictionary values with double quotes in the command list.
- The error message indicates a difference in formatting between the expected command list and the actual command list, specifically related to the formatting of dictionary values.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is caused by adding unnecessary double quotes around dictionary values when constructing the command list, leading to a mismatch with the expected command list and failing the test.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
Remove the unnecessary double quotes around dictionary values when constructing the command list to align with the expected format.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
# Corrected version of the buggy function
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():  # Change variable name to val to avoid conflict
            command += [name, '{0}={1}'.format(prop, val)]  # Remove unnecessary double quotes
    return command
```

By making the above correction in the `_dict_arg` function, the issue causing the failing test due to incorrect command construction should be resolved.
