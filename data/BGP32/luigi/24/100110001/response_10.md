### Analysis:
1. The function `_dict_arg` is supposed to process a dictionary and convert it into a list for command execution in the test cases.
2. The failing test cases are related to commands in the test functions `test_run` and `test_defaults`, where the dictionary values are not converted correctly.
3. The error messages indicate that there is an issue with handling dictionary values where they are not being converted as expected, leading to a mismatch in the command list.
4. The main cause of the bug seems to be the incorrect formatting of dictionary key-value pairs inside the command list.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. The function should correctly format dictionary key-value pairs in the command list without unnecessary quotes for the values.
2. Ensure that the dictionary values are appended to the command list as individual elements without additional quotations.
3. Update the `_dict_arg` function to address the conversion of dictionary values more accurately.

### Corrected Version:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, '{0}={1}'.format(prop, val)]
    return command
```

In the corrected version of the `_dict_arg` function, the values are added to the command list without extra quotes. This change should address the bug causing the failing test cases.
