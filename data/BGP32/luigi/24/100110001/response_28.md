### Analysis:
The `_dict_arg` function within the `spark.py` file is expected to construct a command list based on the input dictionary. However, the current implementation is incorrectly appending the dictionary key-value pairs in the format `"{key}={value}"` enclosed in double quotes. This incorrect formatting leads to failing tests due to differences in the expected and actual lists of command arguments.

### Bug:
The bug in the `_dict_arg` function is caused by the incorrect formatting of key-value pairs when constructing the command list. Instead of directly adding `"{key}={value}"` to the command list, the correct format should be `"{key}", "{value}"` without enclosing the value in double quotes.

### Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, the key-value pairs should be added separately to the command list without enclosing the value in quotes.

### Corrected Function:
```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, prop, val]  # Corrected format for adding key-value pairs
    return command
```

After applying this fix, the updated function should correctly format the command list based on the input dictionary, resolving the failing tests.
