### Analysis:
1. The `_dict_arg` function is meant to convert a dictionary into a list of command-line arguments in the format `name=value`.
2. The failing tests indicate that there are discrepancies in the format of the arguments generated by the `_dict_arg` function, resulting in assertion errors.
3. The cause of the bug is that the function is adding unnecessary double quotes around the values in the generated command list.
4. To fix the bug, we need to remove the extra double quotes around the values while formatting them into the command list.

### Bug Fix:
```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():  # Fix 1: Changed variable name from value to val
            command += [name, '{0}={1}'.format(prop, val)]  # Fix 2: Removed unnecessary double quotes
    return command
```

By making the above bug fixes, the `_dict_arg` function should now correctly convert the dictionary into a list of command-line arguments without any extra double quotes. This corrected version of the function should pass the failing tests provided.
