### Analysis:
1. The `_dict_arg` function is meant to convert a dictionary into command arguments, but it's currently not handling the values properly.
2. The failing test cases are comparing the expected command arguments with the output of the `_dict_arg` function.
3. The error messages indicate that there is an issue with how the function is handling values from the dictionary, leading to incorrect formatting.
4. The issue is related to incorrect handling of quoting around dictionary values in the command list.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to modify the way values are handled when constructing the command list from the dictionary. Specifically, we need to ensure proper quoting and formatting of values.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            # Check if the value contains spaces, if so, enclose it in double quotes
            if ' ' in val:
                command += [name, '"{0}={1}"'.format(prop, val)]
            else:
                command += [name, '{0}={1}'.format(prop, val)]
    return command
```

By making this adjustment, the function now correctly handles values that contain spaces by enclosing them in double quotes when constructing the command list from the dictionary. This should address the bug and ensure that the corrected function passes the failing test cases.
