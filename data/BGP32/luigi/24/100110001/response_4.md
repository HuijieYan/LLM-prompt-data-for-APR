### Analysis:
The `_dict_arg` function is meant to take a dictionary `value` and construct a command list based on its key-value pairs. However, in the buggy version of the function, the values are wrapped inside double quotes which is causing the failing tests to compare the actual and expected command lists as different due to the presence of extra quotes on some values.

### Bug Location:
The bug is located in the line:
```python
command += [name, '"{0}={1}"'.format(prop, value)]
```
The double quotes around `{1}` are causing the issue.

### Cause of the Bug:
The cause of the bug is due to unnecessary double quotes being added to the values in the command list. This causes discrepancies between the actual and expected command list in the failing tests, leading to assertion errors.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
Remove the unnecessary double quotes when constructing the command list to ensure that the values are in the correct format for comparison with the expected command list.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, '{0}={1}'.format(prop, val)]
    return command
```

By making this change, the function will construct the command list without unnecessary double quotes, allowing it to pass the failing tests.
