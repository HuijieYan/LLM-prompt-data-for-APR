### Analysis:
1. The `_dict_arg` function is intended to convert a dictionary into a list of command arguments, where each key-value pair in the dictionary is represented as a string in the list.
2. The function iterates over the dictionary items and appends the key and value formatted as a string with `"{0}={1}"` template.
3. The failing test cases provide expected lists of strings reflecting the command arguments in a certain order.
4. The error messages indicate that the function is not formatting the key-value pair properly for certain arguments, leading to assertion failures.

### Bug Cause:
The bug arises due to the misuse of double quotes `""` around the formatted key-value pair in the `_dict_arg` function. This results in a mismatch between the expected list of strings and the actual one, causing the test failures.

### Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to remove the unnecessary double quotes around the formatted key-value pair in the command arguments list.

### Corrected Function:
```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, value in value.items():
            command += [name, '{0}={1}'.format(prop, value)]
    return command
```

After making this correction in the `_dict_arg` function, it should format the key-value pairs correctly without any additional double quotes. This change should resolve the failing test cases.
