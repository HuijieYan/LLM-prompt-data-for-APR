### Analysis:
1. The provided `_dict_arg` function is supposed to convert a dictionary into a list of command arguments, but it is failing to do so correctly.
2. The failing tests are trying to assert that the output of the function matches the expected list of arguments.
3. The error messages indicate that the differences in the lists are due to the handling of dictionary values during conversion.
4. The function is incorrectly adding double quotes around the property values in the command list.

### Bug Cause:
The bug in the `_dict_arg` function is caused by adding double quotes around the formatted property values when constructing the command list, which leads to a mismatch with the expected output in the test cases.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we should remove the unnecessary double quotes around the property values when formatting the command list. This will ensure that the function correctly converts the dictionary to a list of command arguments that match the expected output.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, '{}={}'.format(prop, val)]
    return command
```

By updating the `_dict_arg` function to remove the unnecessary double quotes, it should now correctly convert the dictionary to a list of command arguments that match the expected output in the test cases.
