## Analysis:
The `_dict_arg` function takes in a `name` and `value` parameter, checks if the `value` is a dictionary, and constructs a list of command arguments based on the key-value pairs in the dictionary. The function formats the key-value pairs with double quotes around the values.

In both failing test cases, the error occurs when comparing the actual list of command arguments generated by the `_dict_arg` function with the expected list of command arguments. The differences in the lists are due to extra double quotes added by the function around certain values in the generated command list.

## Bug:
The bug in the `_dict_arg` function is that it is incorrectly adding double quotes around the values in the command arguments list, resulting in a mismatch between the expected and actual lists in the test cases.

## Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, the function `_dict_arg` should not add double quotes around the values when constructing the list of command arguments.

## Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, '{0}={1}'.format(prop, val)]
    return command
```

In the corrected version of the function, the `.format` method is used to concatenate the key and value without adding extra double quotes around the values.

By making this change in the `_dict_arg` function, the function will generate the correct list of command arguments without unnecessary double quotes, and the failing tests will pass.
