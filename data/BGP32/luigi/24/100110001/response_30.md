### Analysis:
1. The provided `_dict_arg` function is intended to convert a dictionary into a list of command line arguments.
2. The function iterates over the dictionary items and constructs a list of arguments based on the key-value pairs.
3. The failing tests are checking the command line arguments generated by the module.
4. The error message indicates that there is a mismatch between the expected and actual command line arguments.
5. The discrepancy is due to the fact that the values generated by the `_dict_arg` function are being enclosed in double quotes.

### Bug:
The bug in the `_dict_arg` function is caused by the incorrect use of double quotes around the value while constructing the command list. The quotes are unnecessary and causing the generated command list to differ from the expected list in the tests.

### Fix:
To fix the bug, remove the unnecessary double quotes around the value while constructing the command list.

### Corrected Version:
```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: luigi/contrib/spark.py

# Corrected version of the function
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():  # Changed the variable name 'value' to 'val'
            command += [name, '{0}={1}'.format(prop, val)]  # Removed double quotes around {0}={1}
    return command
```

By making this correction, the generated command list will not unnecessarily enclose the values in double quotes, resolving the mismatch issue with the expected command list in the tests.
