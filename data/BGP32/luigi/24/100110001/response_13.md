### Analysis:
#### Bug:
The `_dict_arg` function is not handling the dictionary values correctly. It is adding double quotes to string values in the dictionary directly, causing a mismatch with the expected output in the test functions.

#### Test Function 1:
The first failing test (`test_run`) expects the output to be a list of arguments for a command. The test fails due to a mismatch between the expected list and the actual list generated by the `_dict_arg` function. The error occurs due to incorrect handling of dictionary values within the function.

#### Test Function 2:
The second failing test (`test_defaults`) also expects the output to be a list of arguments for a command. Similar to the first test, this test fails due to mismatches in the list generated by `_dict_arg` function where dictionary values are not processed correctly.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to modify the `_dict_arg` function to correctly handle dictionary values. Specifically, when building the command list from dictionary items, we need to ensure that string values are formatted correctly without extra quotes and non-string values are handled appropriately.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            if isinstance(val, str):
                command += [name, '{}={}'.format(prop, val)]
            else:
                command += [name, '{}={}'.format(prop, val)]
    return command
```

In the corrected version, the function handles both string and non-string values correctly without adding unnecessary quotes around strings.

By implementing the above correction, the `_dict_arg` function should now correctly format the dictionary values into a list of arguments, allowing the test cases to pass successfully.
