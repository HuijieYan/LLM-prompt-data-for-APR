### Analysis:
1. The `_dict_arg` function is intended to convert a dictionary into a list of command arguments. 
2. The failing tests are checking if the command arguments generated by the `_dict_arg` function match the expected list of arguments.
3. The error messages indicate that there are discrepancies in the arguments generated by `_dict_arg` function, particularly with respect to how string values are handled in the list.
4. The bug seems to be related to how string values from the dictionary are quoted in the command list.

### Bug Cause:
- The bug arises from the use of quotes around `{0}={1}` in the format string `'"{0}={1}"'`. This causes the values from the dictionary to be enclosed in double quotes, resulting in discrepancies when comparing with the expected argument list.

### Fix Strategy:
- Remove the additional double quotes enclosing the value in the format string. This will ensure that the values are directly inserted into the command list without being enclosed in quotes.

### Corrected Code:
```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():  # Changed variable name from 'value' to 'val' to handle nested values
            command += [name, '{0}={1}'.format(prop, val)]  # Removed double quotes around {0}={1}
    return command
``` 

With this corrected version, the values from the dictionary will be directly inserted into the command list without being enclosed in double quotes, fixing the bug.
