### Analysis:
The `_dict_arg` function takes in a dictionary `value` and converts it into a list `command`. The issue arises when creating a formatted string in the command list, which results in extra double quotes being added around the property value.

### Identified Bug:
The bug is in this line:
```python
command += [name, '"{0}={1}"'.format(prop, value)]
```

The usage of double quotes around the formatted property value is causing it to be enclosed in additional quotes if it already contains quotes. This leads to a mismatch when comparing the expected list with the actual list while testing.

### Bug Cause:
The bug causes extra double quotes to be added around the property value in the command list, resulting in a failed comparison during testing. This discrepancy is due to the way the property value is formatted and appended to the command list.

### Fix Strategy:
To fix this bug, we should remove the extra double quotes when formatting the property value to ensure that it gets added correctly to the command list without being enclosed in additional quotes.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, "{0}={1}".format(prop, val)]  # Corrected line without extra quotes
    return command
```

After making this change, the corrected function should now properly format the property value without adding additional quotes. This correction should resolve the failed tests associated with the buggy function.
