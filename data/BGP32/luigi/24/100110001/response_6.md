### Analysis:
1. The `_dict_arg` function in the `spark.py` file is supposed to convert a dictionary of properties to a list of commands.
2. The failing tests are checking the output of the function when provided with specific input dictionaries. The error messages show differences in the format of the generated command lists.
3. The root cause of the bug is the use of string formatting with quotation marks around the values in the generated commands, leading to discrepancies during comparison.

### Bug Cause:
- The `_dict_arg` function is incorrectly adding quotes around the values when constructing the commands from the input dictionary, causing a mismatch with the expected output in the failing tests.

### Fix Strategy:
- Modify the `_dict_arg` function to remove the unnecessary quotation marks from around the values when creating the command list.
- Update the function to properly form the commands without quotation marks around the values.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, '{0}={1}'.format(prop, val)]  # Remove unnecessary quotes
    return command
```

By correcting the `_dict_arg` function as shown above, the bug causing the failing tests should be fixed, and the function should generate the correct output for the given test cases.
