### Analysis:
The provided `_dict_arg` function has a bug where it converts the dictionary values to strings with quotes around them. This conversion causes the failing test cases since the expected values are without quotes. This discrepancy leads to a difference in the lists when compared in the test functions.

### Bug Cause:
The bug in the `_dict_arg` function arises from adding unnecessary quotes around the dictionary values when constructing the command list. This leads to a mismatch between the expected command list in the test functions and the actual generated command list.

### Proposed Fix:
To fix the bug, the unnecessary quotes around the dictionary values need to be removed while constructing the command list. This can be achieved by directly adding the property and value without surrounding them with quotes.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, '{0}={1}'.format(prop, val)]
    return command
```

By eliminating the unnecessary quotes around the values in the `name=value` format, the corrected version of the `_dict_arg` function ensures that the generated command list aligns with the expected command list in the test cases. This correction should resolve the failing test cases.
