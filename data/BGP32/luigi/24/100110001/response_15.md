### Analysis:
The `_dict_arg` function is supposed to convert a dictionary to a list of command-line arguments. However, the bug is in the formatting of the arguments, where the properties and values are enclosed in double quotes in an improper manner.

### Error Location:
The bug is primarily located in the way the properties and values are formatted in the command list.

### Bug Cause:
The buggy function adds double quotes around the properties and values in the command list, which causes a mismatch with the expected command in the test. It results in a failed assertion due to the incorrect formatting.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we should avoid adding double quotes around the properties and values in the command list. Instead, the properties and values should be added as-is to the command list.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, '{0}={1}'.format(prop, val)]
    return command
```

In the corrected version, the function correctly formats the properties and values without enclosing them in double quotes. This change ensures that the command list is generated as expected.

This corrected version should pass the failing tests provided.
