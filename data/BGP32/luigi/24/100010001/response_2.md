### Analysis:
The error messages indicate that there is a discrepancy between the expected list of arguments passed to the subprocess `Popen` function and the actual list of arguments obtained during the test. The discrepancies are due to the presence of additional double quotes around certain arguments in the actual list, which is not present in the expected list.

### Bug:
The function `_dict_arg` is adding double quotes around the property values while generating the command list. This is causing the values to be enclosed in double quotes when building the command, leading to an incorrect command list.

### Fix:
To fix this bug, we need to remove the double quotes around the property values in the `command` list generated by the `_dict_arg` function.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, '{0}={1}'.format(prop, val)]  # removed double quotes from format string
    return command
```

By updating the `_dict_arg` function as shown above, the bug causing extra double quotes around property values will be fixed, ultimately passing the failing tests.
