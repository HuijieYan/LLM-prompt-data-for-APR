### Analysis:
The error messages indicate that there are issues with generating the command list correctly in the `_dict_arg` function. The function is not handling dictionary values properly, resulting in incorrect formatting of key-value pairs in the command list.

### Potential Error Locations:
1. The loop that iterates over the dictionary key-value pairs may not be constructing the command list correctly.
2. The formatting of key-value pairs might be incorrect, resulting in extra quotes in the command list.

### Cause of the Bug:
The bug is caused by the incorrect formatting of key-value pairs when generating the command list. The buggy function is adding extra quotes around the value in the key-value pair, leading to inconsistencies when comparing the generated command list with the expected command list in the test cases.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to modify the `_dict_arg` function to properly handle dictionary values and correctly format key-value pairs without adding unnecessary quotes.

### Corrected Version of the Code:
```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():  # Fix variable name to avoid overwriting value
            command += [name, '{0}={1}'.format(prop, val)]  # Fix formatting of key-value pair without unnecessary quotes
    return command
```

By making these modifications, we ensure that the key-value pairs are formatted correctly in the command list without any extra quotes. This corrected version of the code should pass the failing test cases.
