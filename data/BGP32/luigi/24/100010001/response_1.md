### Analysis:
The error messages indicate that there are issues with how the properties (e.g., '--conf', '--properties-file') are being handled in the command list generated by the `_dict_arg` function. The function is converting the dictionary items to strings in a way that causes discrepancies in the comparison during the test.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is caused by adding extra quotes around the values when forming the command list in the `_dict_arg` function. This extra quoting results in a mismatch between the expected command list and the actual command list generated during the test.

### Bug Fix:
To fix the bug, we need to remove the extra quotes around the values when formatting the command list within the `_dict_arg` function. By ensuring that the values are added without additional quotes, we can generate a command list that matches the expected format.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, value in value.items():
            command += [name, '{0}={1}'.format(prop, value)]
    return command
```

In the corrected version, the formatting of the key-value pairs within the `for` loop has been adjusted to remove the extra quotes. This modification should allow the command list to be generated correctly without additional quoting around the values.
