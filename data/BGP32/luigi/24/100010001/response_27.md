1. The buggy function `_dict_arg` is intended to convert a dictionary argument into a list of command line arguments. The error message indicates a failing test due to a mismatch in the generated command list compared to the expected command list.

2. The potential error location is the formatting of the command list within the loop that iterates over the key-value pairs of the dictionary argument.

3. The bug occurs due to incorrectly formatting the individual command values in the list. The function is adding double quotes around the values in the command list, which is not required and causing the test failures.

4. To fix the bug, we need to remove the unnecessary double quotes and correctly generate the command list.

5. Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():  # Changed 'value' to 'val' to avoid naming conflict
            command += [name, "{0}={1}".format(prop, val)]  # Changed formatting of command values
    return command
```

With this corrected version, the function should correctly format the command list without unnecessary double quotes around the values, resolving the test failures.
