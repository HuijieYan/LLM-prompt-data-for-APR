### Analysis:
The error message indicates that there is a difference between the expected command list and the actual command list generated by the `_dict_arg` function. The difference seems to be related to how dictionary values are handled within the function.

### Potential Error Locations:
The potential error might be in how the function handles dictionary values when creating the command list. Specifically, the issue might be related to the format in which key-value pairs are added to the command list.

### Cause of the Bug:
The bug is caused by the function `_dict_arg` incorrectly formatting the dictionary values as strings with double quotes, causing a mismatch between the expected and actual command lists. This is evident from the error messages showing differences in formatting for dictionary values.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
1. Iterate over the dictionary items and directly append the key and value to the command list without converting the value to a string enclosed in double quotes.
2. Check if the value in a key-value pair is already a string and handle it accordingly to avoid unnecessary formatting.
3. Ensure that the function properly handles different types of values within the dictionary.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, prop_value in value.items():
            if isinstance(prop_value, str):
                command += [name, "{0}={1}".format(prop, prop_value)]
            else:
                command += [name, prop, str(prop_value)]
    return command
```

By modifying the function to handle dictionary values correctly as shown above, we ensure that the key-value pairs are added to the command list in the expected format. This corrected version should resolve the issue and pass the failing tests.
