### Analysis:
The error messages indicate a difference in the expected output and the actual output of the `proc.call_args[0][0]` list. The differences are related to how the `prop` and `value` pairs are handled by the `_dict_arg` function. The function is currently enclosing the value in double quotes which is causing the assertion errors as the expected format does not have double quotes for `prop=value` pairs.

### Bug Location:
The bug lies in the `_dict_arg` function where the values are being enclosed in double quotes unnecessarily.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is caused by the line:  
`command += [name, '"{0}={1}"'.format(prop, value)]`  
This format adds unnecessary double quotes around the values resulting in mismatched formats in the test cases.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug:
- Modify the line to format the `prop` and `value` pair without adding double quotes.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, "{0}={1}".format(prop, val)]
    return command
```

By correcting the function as shown above, the bug will be fixed and the test cases should pass without any assertion errors.
