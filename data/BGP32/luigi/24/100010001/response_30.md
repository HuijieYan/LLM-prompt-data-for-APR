1. The error messages indicate that there are differences between the expected command arguments and the actual command arguments passed to the subprocess. The differences mainly involve how the dictionary arguments are being formatted in the `_dict_arg` function.

2. The potential error location is within the `_dict_arg` function where dictionary key-value pairs are being constructed into a list.

3. The cause of the bug is the incorrect formatting of dictionary key-value pairs in the `_dict_arg` function. The function is adding quotes around the value when constructing the command list, which is leading to differences in the expected and actual command arguments.

4. To fix the bug, we should update the `_dict_arg` function to correctly format the dictionary key-value pairs without adding additional quotes around the values.

5. Here is the corrected version of the `_dict_arg` function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, '{0}={1}'.format(prop, val)]
    return command
```

By making this adjustment, the function will construct the command list without including unnecessary quotes around the values. This change should fix the bug and ensure that the command arguments are correctly formatted for the subprocess calls in the tests.
