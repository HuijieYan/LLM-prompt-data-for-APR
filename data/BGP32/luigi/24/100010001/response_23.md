### Analysis:
The buggy function `_dict_arg` is intended to construct a list based on a dictionary `value`. However, there is a bug in the function where the function appends the key-value pairs instead of just values to the `command` list. This causes unexpected quotes around the values, leading to assertion errors in the tests where the command list is compared.

### Bug:
The bug occurs because the function is using `'"{0}={1}"'.format(prop, value)` to format the key-value pairs, resulting in an extra set of quotes around the values in the resulting list.

### Fix:
To fix the bug, we need to remove the quotes around the values in the key-value pairs. To do this, we can modify the formatting string to use `{0}={1}` instead of `"{0}={1}"`.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items(): # Changed variable name from value to val
            command += [name, '{0}={1}'.format(prop, val)] # Removed quotes around {1}
    return command
```

By making this change, the corrected version of the `_dict_arg` function should now pass the failing tests.
