#### Analysis:
The buggy function `_dict_arg` is intended to convert a dictionary input into a list of command line arguments. The error messages from the failing tests indicate that there is an issue with the conversion of dictionary values to command line arguments. Specifically, the function seems to be adding unnecessary double quotes around some of the property values.

#### Error Location:
The issue lies in this line of code:
```python
command += [name, '"{0}={1}"'.format(prop, value)]
```

#### Cause of the Bug:
The bug is caused by adding double quotes around the value in the format string `"{0}={1}"`. This results in some properties having their values enclosed in double quotes, which leads to mismatching values in the generated command.

#### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to remove the unnecessary double quotes when constructing the command list. This can be achieved by only adding the property name and value without any additional formatting.

#### Corrected Version:
```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, '{0}={1}'.format(prop, val)]
    return command
``` 

By making this change, the function will correctly generate the command list without adding unnecessary double quotes around property values. This should resolve the mismatch issue in the failing tests.
