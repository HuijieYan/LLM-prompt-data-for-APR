### Analysis:
The buggy function `_dict_arg` is intended to convert a dictionary into a list of command-line arguments. However, the bug lies in how the function processes the values of the dictionary. It is currently converting the value in the form of a string with double quotes, which is causing a mismatch with the expected output in the failing tests. The error messages indicate the mismatch occurs due to the presence of extra quotes in the output list.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is caused by the usage of double quotes around the values when formatting them in the `command` list inside the `for` loop. The double quotes are not necessary and they are causing the test to fail as the expected output does not include them.

### Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to remove the double quotes from around the formatted values before appending them to the `command` list. This will ensure that the command list generated by the function matches the expected output in the tests.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, '{0}={1}'.format(prop, val)]
    return command
```

By removing the unnecessary double quotes around the values in the `command` list, the function now correctly converts the dictionary into a list of command-line arguments. This corrected version should pass the failing tests.
