### Analysis:
The buggy function `_dict_arg` in the `spark.py` file is supposed to process a dictionary by converting it into a list of command arguments. The function is iterating through the key-value pairs in the dictionary and appending the arguments to the `command` list. However, in the output provided by the failing test cases, we can see that the function is adding extra double quotes around the values which is causing the lists to differ when compared.

### Potential Error Location:
The error lies in the line where the function appends the arguments to the `command` list by formatting them as strings with quotes.

### Cause of the Bug:
The bug is caused by the incorrect formatting of the values in the dictionary as strings with surrounding double quotes. This formatting is not required and is leading to a discrepancy in the expected command list in the test cases.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to modify the function to not wrap the values with double quotes when appending them to the command list. By directly appending the key-value pair without quotes, the resulting command list will match the expected output in the test cases.

### Corrected Version:
```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: luigi/contrib/spark.py

def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():  # Changed variable name to 'val' to avoid conflict with outer loop variable
            command += [name, '{0}={1}'.format(prop, val)]  # Removed unnecessary quotes around val
    return command
``` 

By making this change, the function will correctly format the key-value pairs from the dictionary without adding unnecessary double quotes. This correction should resolve the differences in the command lists observed in the failing test cases.
