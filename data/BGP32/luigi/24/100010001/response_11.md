### Analysis:
The `error` message indicates that there is a mismatch between the expected and actual lists. The specific elements causing the mismatch are related to the handling of dictionary values within the `_dict_arg` function.

### Potential Error Locations:
1. The function is concatenating the arguments list without handling the dictionary values correctly.
2. The function is formatting the dictionary values incorrectly when constructing the command list.
3. The function is not converting dictionary values to strings properly.

### Cause of the Bug:
The bug in the `_dict_arg` function arises from the incorrect handling of dictionary values. When constructing the command list, the function wraps dictionary values in double quotes, resulting in a mismatch with the expected list of arguments. This discrepancy leads to the assertion errors observed in the failing tests.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug:
1. Ensure that dictionary values are converted to strings without additional quotes.
2. Modify the formatting of dictionary values to match the expected format.
3. Update the function to correctly handle dictionary values when constructing the command list.

### Corrected Version:
Here is the corrected version of the `_dict_arg` function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, '{0}={1}'.format(prop, val)]
    return command
```

By modifying the way dictionary values are processed and formatted within the function, the corrected version is expected to pass the failing tests.
