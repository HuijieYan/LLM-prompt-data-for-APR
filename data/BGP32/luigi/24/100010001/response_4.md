### Analysis:
The buggy function `_dict_arg` is supposed to convert a dictionary into a list of command arguments. However, the bug seems to be related to the formatting of the arguments within the list. The error messages indicate a difference in formatting when converting the dictionary values to command arguments.

### Error:
The function is adding double quotes around both the property and value when constructing the command list. This causes the test cases to fail as the test inputs do not expect the values to be enclosed in quotes.

### Fix:
To fix this bug, we need to modify the `_dict_arg` function to include the property and value directly without enclosing them in double quotes. 

### Corrected Version:
```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, '{0}={1}'.format(prop, val)]  # removed double quotes here
    return command
```

After making this modification, the function should correctly generate the command list without enclosing the property and value in quotes. This change should make the function compatible with the test cases.
