## Analysis:
The error message indicates that there is a difference in the list returned by the `_dict_arg` function and the expected list in the test cases. Specifically, the values within the dictionary arguments are not formatted correctly, causing a mismatch between the expected and actual list of command arguments.

## Error Location:
The error is occurring in the `_dict_arg` function where the values from the dictionary are being incorrectly formatted when constructing the command list.

## Cause of the Bug:
The bug is caused by the way key-value pairs from the dictionary are being formatted. The function is adding double quotes around the value, causing a mismatch with the expected command arguments.

## Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to remove the unnecessary double quotes around the values in the dictionary when constructing the command list.

## Corrected Version:
Here is the corrected version of the `_dict_arg` function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, '{0}={1}'.format(prop, val)]  # Update the format to not include unnecessary quotes
    return command
```

By updating the function to remove the unnecessary quotes around the values, the function should now correctly generate the command list as expected by the test cases.
