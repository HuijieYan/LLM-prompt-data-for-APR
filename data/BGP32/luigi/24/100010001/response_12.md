### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_dict_arg` is intended to convert a dictionary `value` into a list of command line arguments for a command.
2. The error message suggests that the bug arises when handling key-value pairs in the input dictionary.
3. The bug seems to be caused by the extra double quotes surrounding the value of the property in the command list.
4. The strategy to fix the bug is to remove the unnecessary double quotes when formatting the property-value pair in the command list.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():  # Avoid using the variable name 'value' inside the loop
            command += [name, '{0}={1}'.format(prop, val)]  # Removed unnecessary double quotes
    return command
```

By making the above change, the function should now correctly format the property-value pairs without additional double quotes, fixing the bug related to the command list generation.
