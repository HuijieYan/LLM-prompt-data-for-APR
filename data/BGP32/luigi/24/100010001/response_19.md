### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_dict_arg(self, name, value)` is used to format a dictionary into a list for a command configuration.
2. The error messages indicate that the function is not handling dictionary values correctly, resulting in extra quotes around the values which is causing assertion errors in the test cases.

### Potential Error Locations:
1. The use of double quotes `"{0}={1}"` in the format statement may be causing the extra quotes around the property values.
2. Incorrect handling of the dictionary values being passed to the function.

### Bug Cause:
The bug in the `_dict_arg` function lies in the formatting of the property values. The format `"{0}={1}"` is causing unintended double quotes around the values. This leads to mismatched values in the test cases and causes assertion errors.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the formatting of the property values is done without adding extra quotes. We should remove the double quotes around the formatting in order to correctly format the dictionary values.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, "{0}={1}".format(prop, val)]
    return command
```

By removing the double quotes around the formatting in the `"{0}={1}"` statement, the corrected version of the function properly formats the dictionary key-value pairs without adding extra quotes. This should resolve the assertion errors in the test cases.
