### Analysis:
1. The `_dict_arg` function is designed to take a name and a dictionary as arguments, then convert the dictionary into a list of command-line arguments.
2. The error message indicates that there is a difference in the generated command list, specifically in how key-value pairs are formatted.
3. The bug seems to be related to incorrectly wrapping key-value pairs in quotation marks within the command list.
4. To fix the bug, we need to ensure that key-value pairs are not surrounded by additional quotation marks when added to the command list.

### Bug Fix:
```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, '{0}={1}'.format(prop, val)]
    return command
```

By removing the quotation marks from `{0}={1}` format and just directly appending the key-value pairs to the command list, we can fix the bug. This will correctly generate the command list without any additional quotation marks around the key-value pairs.
