### Analysis:
1. The error messages from the failing tests indicate that the values in the command list are not being formatted correctly in the `_dict_arg` function.
2. The function is attempting to format key-value pairs within a dictionary as command arguments, but the formatting is causing issues.
3. The error messages specifically point out differences in the formatting of key-value pairs within the command list.
4. To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the key-value pairs from the dictionary are formatted correctly without additional quotes.
5. The `_dict_arg` function should iterate over the dictionary items and format them properly before adding them to the command list.

### Solution:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, '{0}={1}'.format(prop, val)]
    return command
```

By modifying the `'{0}={1}'` format within the loop, the key-value pairs will be formatted correctly in the command list. This corrected version of the `_dict_arg` function should now properly format the key-value pairs without additional quotes, resolving the bug.
