### Analysis:
The error message indicates that there is a difference in the expected and actual lists being compared. The issue seems to be related to how the values are formatted in the list being generated by the `_dict_arg` function.

### Bug Location:
The bug is within the `_dict_arg` function as it generates a list with incorrect formatting of values, specifically with strings that contain `="value"` format.

### Cause of the Bug:
The bug is caused by the way values are being added to the `command` list in the `_dict_arg` function. The function is adding the values in the format `"{prop}={value}"` within double quotes, which is different from the format expected in the test cases where the values are without double quotes. This inconsistency is causing the test cases to fail.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to modify how the values are being added to the `command` list in the `_dict_arg` function. We should avoid adding the double quotes around the values during concatenation.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, "{0}={1}".format(prop, val)]
    return command
```

By removing the unnecessary double quotes from around the values in the `command` list, the corrected function should now generate the list in the expected format. This should resolve the failing test cases.
