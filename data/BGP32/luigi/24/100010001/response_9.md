### Analysis:
The error message indicates that the assertion failures are due to differences in the way the `"prop1=val1"` arguments are handled. The buggy function `_dict_arg` is responsible for adding double quotes around the property values, leading to mismatches in the test cases.

### Potential Error Locations:
1. The use of `'"{0}={1}"'.format(prop, value)` within the `_dict_arg` function is causing the property values to be enclosed in double quotes.
2. The comparison in the test cases is expecting the property values without double quotes.

### Cause of the Bug:
The bug arises from the incorrect formatting of property values with double quotes within the `_dict_arg` function. This leads to a mismatch between the expected and actual argument lists in the test cases, causing the assertions to fail.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, the double quotes around the property values need to be removed from the command list created by the `_dict_arg` function. This will ensure that the test cases are comparing the expected and actual arguments correctly.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, '{0}={1}'.format(prop, val)]
    return command
```

By removing the double quotes from the format string, the corrected version of the `_dict_arg` function will generate the command list without enclosing the property values in quotes, aligning it with the expected format in the test cases.
