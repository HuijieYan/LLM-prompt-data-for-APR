### Analysis:
1. The `_dict_arg` function in the `luigi/contrib/spark.py` file is intended to build a command list from a dictionary input.
2. The error messages indicate that there are discrepancies between the expected command list and the actual command list generated by the function.
3. The discrepancies stem from the fact that some values are being surrounded by double quotes in the expected command list, while they are not in the actual command list. This is causing the assertion errors.
4. The issue lies in the line where values are formatted with double quotes (`'"{0}={1}"'.format(prop, value)`), causing these values to be enclosed in double quotes in the final command list. This is incorrect for certain cases.
5. To fix the bug, we need to remove the double quotes around the formatted values in the command list.

### Bug Fix:
```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, '{0}={1}'.format(prop, val)]  # Removed double quotes around formatted value
    return command
```

By making this change, the formatted values will not be enclosed in double quotes, fixing the bug and ensuring that the command list is generated correctly. This corrected version should now pass the failing tests.
