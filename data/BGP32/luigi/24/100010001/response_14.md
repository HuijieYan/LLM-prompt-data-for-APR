#### Analysis:
The `test_run` and `test_defaults` tests are failing due to a mismatch in the command arguments generated by the `_dict_arg` function. The function is intended to create a command list from a dictionary of arguments. However, there is an issue when constructing the command strings for each key-value pair.

#### Identified Bug:
- The bug in the `_dict_arg` function is that it is adding double quotes around the value in the command list even if it is not necessary. This is causing the command arguments to be incorrectly formatted.

#### Bug Fix Strategy:
- Update the `_dict_arg` function to check if the value is a string before adding double quotes. If the value is a string, no quotes should be added. If the value is any other type, quotes should be added.

#### Corrected Version:
```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            if isinstance(val, str):  # Check if value is a string
                command += [name, '{0}={1}'.format(prop, val)]  # No quotes for strings
            else:
                command += [name, '"{0}={1}"'.format(prop, val)]  # Add quotes for non-string values
    return command
``` 

By making this change, the `_dict_arg` function will now correctly construct the command list without incorrectly formatting the arguments. The corrected version should pass the failing tests.
