### Analysis:
The error messages indicate that there is a mismatch in the format of the command list that is being generated by the `_dict_arg` function. In both cases, the issue is related to the handling of dictionary values within the function.

### Identified Bug:
The bug is caused by the function `_dict_arg` incorrectly formatting the dictionary values. It is adding extra quotes around the values when constructing the command list, leading to a mismatch when compared with the expected command list.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to adjust the way the values are added to the command list. Specifically, we should not add quotes around the values in the command list for dictionary items.

### Corrected Version:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():  # Changed variable name to avoid conflict
            command += [name, '{0}={1}'.format(prop, val)]  # Removed quotes around the value
    return command
```

By removing the extra quotes around the value in the command construction, the corrected version will generate a command list that matches the expected format.
