### Analysis:
The error messages indicate that there are differences between the expected command lists and the actual command lists generated by the `_dict_arg` function. In both cases, the discrepancy arises from the format of the key-value pairs passed in the dictionary argument.

### Error Locations:
1. The function `_dict_arg` is not handling the key-value pairs correctly when constructing the command list.
2. The function is enclosing the key-values pairs in double quotes, which is causing discrepancies.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is caused by the incorrect handling of key-value pairs in the dictionary argument within the `_dict_arg` function. The function is adding unnecessary double quotes around the values, leading to mismatched command lists.

### Fixing Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to modify the `_dict_arg` function so that it correctly constructs the command list without enclosing the values in double quotes.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, '{0}={1}'.format(prop, val)]
    return command
```

By making this change, the key-value pairs are formatted correctly without unnecessary double quotes, ensuring that the command lists match the expected values in the test cases.
