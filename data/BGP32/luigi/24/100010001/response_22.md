### Analysis:
1. The error message indicates a mismatch between the expected command arguments list and the actual command arguments list returned by the `_dict_arg` function.
2. The error is specifically related to the conversion of dictionary key-value pairs into command arguments.
3. It seems like the `_dict_arg` function is enclosing the value part of key-value pairs within double quotes, which is causing a mismatch in the test cases as the test cases do not expect quotes around the values.
4. The strategy to fix the bug is to update the `_dict_arg` function to only format the key-value pairs without enclosing the values in double quotes.

### Corrected Function:
```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, '{0}={1}'.format(prop, val)]
    return command
```

By removing the double quotes around the `{1}` placeholder in the `format` method, the function will correctly format the key-value pairs without including the quotes in the output. This change should align the function output with the expected command arguments in the test cases.
