### Analysis:
1. The error message indicates that there is a mismatch between the expected command list and the actual command list generated by the `_dict_arg` function.
2. The error is caused by the function `_dict_arg` incorrectly adding quotes around the property value pairs in the generated command list.
3. The function is formatting the property values with quotes, which leads to a mismatch with the expected command list.
4. To fix the bug, we need to modify the `_dict_arg` function to not include quotes around the property value pairs in the command list.

### Correction:
```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, '{}={}'.format(prop, val)]  # removed quotes around {prop}={value}
    return command
```

By removing the quotes around the value in the `'{prop}={value}'` format string, we ensure that the property-value pairs are correctly formatted in the command list without unnecessary quotes.
