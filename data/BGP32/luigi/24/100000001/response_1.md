## Analysis:
The buggy function `_dict_arg` is intended to convert a dictionary argument into a list of strings to be used as command line arguments. It iterates over key-value pairs in the dictionary and constructs a list by formatting the key-value pairs as strings. However, there is a bug in the way the string formatting is done within the function.

## Potential Error Locations:
1. The bug might be related to the way the key-value pairs are formatted as strings using `"{0}={1}"`. The escaping of quotes and equal signs within the format string could be causing issues.
2. The use of the same variable name `value` for the loop variable and function argument could lead to confusion and potential issues.

## Cause of the Bug:
The bug is likely caused by the incorrect formatting of key-value pairs within the list comprehension. The format `"{0}={1}"` is used to construct the string, but the quotes around the placeholders `{0}` and `{1}` are causing errors, as the quotes are unnecessary and can interfere with the command execution.

## Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to change the way the key-value pairs are formatted into strings. Removing the unnecessary quotes around the placeholders in the format string should resolve the issue. Also, using a different variable name for the loop variable would clarify the code and prevent potential confusion.

## Corrected Version:
```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():  # Renamed 'value' to 'val'
            command += [name, "{0}={1}".format(prop, val)]  # Removed unnecessary quotes
    return command
``` 

In the corrected version, the format string `"{0}={1}"` no longer contains unnecessary quotes around the placeholders. Additionally, the loop variable `val` is used instead of `value` to avoid confusion with the function argument name.
