## Analysis:
The buggy function `_dict_arg` is supposed to take a dictionary `value` and convert it into a list of arguments to be used in a command. However, there are potential errors in the implementation that may lead to incorrect output.

## Potential Errors:
1. The function uses the same variable `value` for both the input dictionary and the element values in the dictionary comprehension loop. This can cause conflicts and incorrect output.
2. The formatting of the command concatenation using `+=` may not work as expected.

## Cause of the Bug:
The bug is caused by reusing the same variable name `value` for both the input dictionary and the element values in the loop. This leads to unexpected results and potential conflicts.

## Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, it is important to use different variable names for the input dictionary and the loop iteration value. Additionally, care should be taken in properly formatting and concatenating the command elements.

## Corrected Version:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, prop_value in value.items():
            command += [name, '"{0}={1}"'.format(prop, prop_value)]
    return command
```
