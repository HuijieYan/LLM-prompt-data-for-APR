## Analyzing the buggy function:
The function `_dict_arg` takes in a `name` and a `value` (expected to be a dictionary) and constructs a command by iterating over the key-value pairs in the dictionary. Each key-value pair is added to the `command` list with a specific format. However, there are potential issues with how the command is constructed and returned.

## Potential error locations:
1. The variable `value` is used both as the input value and the loop variable inside the loop, which may cause unexpected behavior.
2. The format used to construct each command element may not be correct for the intended purpose.

## Cause of the bug:
1. Reusing the variable `value` within the loop will overwrite the dictionary value being iterated, leading to incorrect command construction.
2. The format `"{0}={1}"` with double quotes may result in incorrect command string formation.

## Strategy for fixing the bug:
1. Use a different variable name for the loop variable to avoid overwriting the dictionary value.
2. Check the format used to ensure it is suitable for constructing the command string correctly.

## Corrected version of the function:
```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for key, val in value.items():
            command += [name, "{0}={1}".format(key, val)]
    return command
```

In the corrected version:
1. Changed the loop variable from `value` to `val` to avoid overwriting the input dictionary value.
2. Used the format `"{0}={1}"` without enclosing the key-value pairs in double quotes for correct command string construction.
