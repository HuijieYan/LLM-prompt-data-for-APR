### Analyzing the buggy function:

This `_dict_arg` function takes in a `name` and a `value`. It checks if the `value` is a dictionary and if it is, it iterates over the key-value pairs in the dictionary, formatting them into a string and appending them to the `command` list. Finally, it returns the `command` list.

### Potential error locations:
1. The function uses the variable name `value` in the for loop which can override the outer `value` argument.
2. The formatting of the command string might be incorrect.

### Cause of the bug:
1. The bug in this function arises from using the same variable name (`value`) for both the loop iteration value and the external value passed to the function. This causes the external `value` to be overwritten within the loop, leading to unexpected behavior.

2. Also, the way the command string is being formatted may lead to incorrect command generation, especially when expanding the dictionary values.

### Strategy for fixing the bug:
1. Change the variable name used in the loop to avoid overwriting the original `value` argument.
2. Adjust the string formatting to correctly incorporate properties and values from the dictionary into the command.

### Corrected version of the function:
```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, "{0}={1}".format(prop, val)]
    return command
```

In this corrected version, the loop variable `value` has been renamed to `val` to avoid conflicts with the function argument. The string formatting has been adjusted to concatenate `prop` and `val` directly without unnecessary quotation marks.
