### Analysis:
- The buggy function `_dict_arg` is supposed to construct a list of command arguments based on a given dictionary `value`.
- The function iterates through the key-value pairs in the dictionary and appends them to the `command` list in the format `<name> "<prop>=<value>"`.
- The bug in the function is related to reusing the variable name `value` for the inner loop iteration, which overwrites the input dictionary value.


### Potential Error Locations:
- The variable `value` is being used both as the function argument and as the loop variable within the for loop.


### Cause of the Bug:
- The bug occurs because the variable `value` used in the for loop to iterate over the dictionary items overwrites the function argument `value`, causing unexpected behavior and incorrect output.


### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to use a different variable name in the for loop to avoid overwriting the function argument `value`.


### Corrected Version:
```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():  # Using 'val' as a different variable name
            command += [name, '"{0}={1}"'.format(prop, val)]
    return command
```
