## Analysis:
- The function is designed to convert a dictionary `value` into a list of command arguments represented as strings in the format `name "prop=value"`.
- The potential errors in the function are:
  1. Reusing the variable `value` for both the input dictionary and the key of the loop iteration, which can lead to unexpected behavior.
  2. Incorrectly formatting the command string where there shouldn't be double quotes around the `prop=value` pair.

## Bug Explanation:
- The bug in the function is caused by reusing the variable `value` for both the input dictionary and the key of the loop iteration. This causes the original `value` to be overwritten within the loop, resulting in an incorrect command list.

## Bug Fix Strategy:
- To fix the bug, use a different variable name for the loop iteration key to avoid overwriting the original `value` dictionary. Additionally, adjust the string formatting to correctly represent the command.

## Corrected Version:
```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, prop_value in value.items():  # Change the variable name from value to prop_value
            command += [name, "{0}={1}".format(prop, prop_value)]  # Adjust the command string format
    return command
```

This corrected version of the function ensures that the input dictionary is correctly converted into a list of command arguments without facing the bug caused by variable reassignment.
