## Analysis:
The buggy function `_dict_arg` is intended to create a list with command arguments based on a dictionary input. However, there are potential errors in the function:
1. The function modifies the `value` variable inside the loop, which can lead to unexpected behavior.
2. The format used to construct each command argument may not be correct, especially with the double quotes.

## Bug Cause:
The bug arises from the function modifying the `value` variable within the loop, leading to incorrect command construction. Additionally, the formatting of the command arguments concatenates the property and value incorrectly, using double quotes which may create problems when the command is executed.

## Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to avoid modifying the `value` variable in the loop. Furthermore, we should adjust the formatting of the command arguments to ensure they are correctly constructed.

## Corrected Version:
```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, '--{0}={1}'.format(prop, val)]
    return command
```

In the corrected version, the `value` variable inside the loop has been changed to `val` to avoid conflicts. Additionally, the format for constructing the command arguments is adjusted to use '--' instead of double quotes, ensuring proper formatting.
