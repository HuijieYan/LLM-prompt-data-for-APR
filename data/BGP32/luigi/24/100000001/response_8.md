## Analyzing the buggy function:
This function `_dict_arg` is supposed to create command arguments based on a dictionary `value` provided. It checks if the input `value` is a dictionary and if so, iterates over its key-value pairs to construct a command list.

## Potential error locations:
1. The usage of the variable `value` within the loop can lead to a bug as it reassigns the loop iteration variable with the same name as the input parameter to the function.

## Cause of the bug:
The bug is caused by the reassignment of the loop iteration variable `value` within the loop, which overwrites the original dictionary `value` provided as an argument to the function.

## Strategy for fixing the bug:
To fix this bug, it's important to use a different variable name within the loop to avoid overwriting the dictionary `value`.

## Corrected version of the function:
```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, '"{0}={1}"'.format(prop, val)]
    return command
```

By renaming the variable `value` within the loop to `val`, we avoid the bug of overwriting the original dictionary `value`. This corrected version of the function should now work as intended.
