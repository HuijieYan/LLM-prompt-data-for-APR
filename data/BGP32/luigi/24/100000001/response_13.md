## Analysis:
The buggy function `_dict_arg` is designed to take a dictionary of key-value pairs and convert it into a list of command arguments for a command line interface. However, there are several issues in the current implementation that need to be addressed.

## Potential Error Locations:
1. The loop in the function uses the variable name `value` both as the key in the dictionary and as the current value being iterated. This can lead to conflicts and unexpected behavior.
2. The way the arguments are being concatenated to the `command` list may not result in the desired format for command line arguments.

## Cause of the Bug:
The main cause of the bug is the variable name conflict within the loop. This leads to incorrect formatting of the command arguments and potentially missing key-value pairs.

## Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
1. Change the variable name used within the loop to avoid conflicts with the parameter name.
2. Adjust the way the command arguments are constructed to ensure they are correctly formatted for a command line interface.

## Corrected Version:
```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for key, val in value.items():
            command += [name, "{0}={1}".format(key, val)]
    return command
```

In the corrected version, the variable names within the loop have been changed to `key` and `val` to avoid conflicts. The command arguments are formatted without using unnecessary quotes around the values. This should address the issues in the original buggy function.
