## Analysis:
The function `_dict_arg` is intended to convert a dictionary into a list of strings with specific formatting. However, there are potential issues within the function that need to be addressed:
1. The function modifies the `value` variable within the loop, which can lead to unexpected behavior.
2. The combination of `name`, `prop`, and `value` in the command generation is not following the intended format.
3. The handling of empty or non-dictionary values is not clearly defined.

## Bug Explanation:
The bug in the function lies in the line `for prop, value in value.items():` where the variable `value` is being reassigned within the loop, causing unexpected behavior. Additionally, the way the `command` list is constructed with `name`, property, and value is incorrect as it does not match the desired format.

## Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to make sure that the loop variables are named in a way that does not conflict with the function argument `value`. The command generation needs to be adjusted to properly format the elements in the list. We also need to handle cases where the input value is empty or not a dictionary.

## Corrected Version:
```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: luigi/contrib/spark.py

def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for key, val in value.items():
            command.append('{0}="{1}={2}"'.format(name, key, val))
    return command
```

In the corrected version:
1. Renamed the loop variables to `key` and `val` to avoid conflicts with the function argument `value`.
2. Adjusted the command generation to properly format the elements in the list.
3. Used `append` to add formatted strings to the `command` list.
4. Handled the case where the `value` is empty or not a dictionary by not entering the loop in those cases.
