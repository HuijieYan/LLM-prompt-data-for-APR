## Analyzing the buggy function:
This function `_dict_arg` takes in a name and a dictionary value, then formats the dictionary items into a command list. The bug arises from the fact that the function is modifying the loop variable `value`, which is used in both the outer loop and the inner loop, causing unexpected behavior.

## Identified potential error locations:
1. Reusing loop variable `value` in both the outer and inner loops.
2. Incorrectly formatting the command with quotes around the key-value pairs.

## Explanation of the bug:
The bug occurs because the loop variable `value` is being modified in the inner loop, which interferes with the operation of the outer loop. This causes unexpected behavior in the construction of the `command` list. Additionally, the use of double quotes inside the format string to enclose key-value pairs may result in incorrect formatting of the command.

## Strategy for fixing the bug:
1. Use a different variable name for the inner loop to avoid conflict with the outer loop variable.
2. Modify the format string to correctly format the command without unnecessary double quotes.

## Corrected version of the function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, '{0}={1}'.format(prop, val)]
    return command
```

In the corrected version, the inner loop variable has been changed to `val` to avoid conflicting with the outer loop variable. The format string has also been adjusted to correctly format the key-value pairs without unnecessary double quotes.
