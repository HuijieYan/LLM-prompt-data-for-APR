## Analysis:
1. The function `_dict_arg` takes in three parameters: `self`, `name`, and `value`.
2. It checks if the `value` is truthy and if it is an instance of a dictionary.
3. If the value is a dictionary, it iterates over its items, constructs a command string using the keys and values, and appends it to the `command` list.
4. However, there is a potential issue with reusing the variable name `value` within the loop, which can lead to unexpected behavior.

## Bug Cause:
The bug in the function is caused by the reuse of the variable name `value` within the for loop. As a result, the initial value of `value` is overwritten, causing unexpected behavior when constructing the command string.

## Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to avoid reusing the variable name `value` within the loop. One way to achieve this is by renaming the loop variable to something different to prevent conflicts with the function parameter `value`.

## Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, prop_value in value.items():  # Change the variable name here
            command += [name, '"{0}={1}"'.format(prop, prop_value)]
    return command
```

By renaming the loop variable to `prop_value`, we ensure that the function parameter `value` is not inadvertently modified within the loop. This corrected version should now properly construct the command list without any unexpected behavior.
