# Analyzing the buggy function:
The function "_dict_arg" is supposed to take a name and a dictionary as input, iterate over the dictionary items, format them as strings, and append them to a list named "command". Finally, it should return the list of formatted strings.

# Potential error locations:
1. The function uses the variable name "value" both as the argument name and in the for loop iteration.
2. The formatting of the string in the line `command += [name, '"{0}={1}"'.format(prop, value)]` seems incorrect.
3. There is no initialization of the "command" list.

# Explanation of the bug:
The bug arises from the fact that the variable "value" is being reassigned within the for loop, leading to inconsistency in the string formatting. Also, the string formatting is incorrect which may cause issues when combining the name and value into a single string.

# Strategy for fixing the bug:
1. Rename the iteration variable in the for loop to avoid conflict with the input parameter.
2. Correct the string formatting to properly concatenate the name, property, and value into a string.
3. Initialize the "command" list at the beginning of the function.

# Corrected version of the function:
```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command.append('{}={}'.format(prop, val))
    return [name] + command
```
