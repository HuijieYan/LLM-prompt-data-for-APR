## Analysis:
The buggy function `_dict_arg` is intended to take a dictionary as input and convert it into a list of command-line arguments. The function iterates over key-value pairs in the dictionary and constructs a list by formatting the keys and values into string representations. However, there are potential errors in this function that need to be addressed.

## Potential Error Locations:
1. The function is using the variable name `value` for both the dictionary value and the value to be added to the command list, which can lead to confusion and unintended behavior.
2. The formatting of the command items with `"{0}={1}"` may result in incorrect formatting of values.

## Cause of the Bug:
The bug in the function is caused by reusing the variable name `value` for both the dictionary value (within the loop) and the formatted value to be added to the command list. This results in incorrect command items being added to the list.

## Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix this bug, we need to use a different variable name for the formatted value being added to the command list. Additionally, we should ensure that the command items are correctly formatted with the key-value pairs from the input dictionary.

## Corrected Version:
```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, '"{0}={1}"'.format(prop, val)]
    return command
```

In the corrected version, the variable `val` is used to store the dictionary value within the loop, and the command items are formatted using this variable to construct the correct list of command-line arguments from the input dictionary.
