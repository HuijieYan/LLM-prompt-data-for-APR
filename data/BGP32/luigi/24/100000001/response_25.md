## Analyzing the buggy function:
The function `_dict_arg` is designed to convert a dictionary into command line arguments by iterating over the key-value pairs in the dictionary and creating a formatted string for each pair. The bug in this function arises from the variable naming conflict between the loop variable `value` and the function argument `value`.

## Identified potential error locations:
1. The variable `value` is used both as a loop variable and as the function argument, which can cause confusion and result in incorrect behavior.
2. The `command` list does not store the correctly formatted command line arguments due to the incorrect usage of the loop iteration variable.

## Cause of the bug:
The bug occurs because the loop iteration variable `value` overwrites the function argument `value`, leading to the creation of incorrect command line argument strings. This results in the function outputting improperly formatted command arguments.

## Strategy for bug fixing:
To fix this bug, we need to change the name of the loop iteration variable to avoid conflicts with the function argument. Additionally, we need to ensure that the command string is constructed correctly to store the formatted arguments.

## Corrected version of the function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, '"{0}={1}"'.format(prop, val)]
    return command
```

In the corrected version, the loop iteration variable is renamed from `value` to `val` to avoid conflicts. This change ensures that the function argument `value` is not inadvertently modified within the loop. Additionally, the `command` list is correctly updated with the formatted command line arguments for each key-value pair in the dictionary.
