## Analyzing the buggy function:
The function `_dict_arg` is expected to receive a dictionary `value` and create a list of command arguments based on the key-value pairs in the dictionary. It iterates over the items in the dictionary, constructs a formatted string for each key-value pair, and appends it to the `command` list.

## Potential error locations:
1. Reassigning the `value` variable within the loop can lead to unexpected behavior.
2. The formatting of the command string may not be correct.
3. The absence of handling empty dictionary cases.

## Cause of the bug:
The bug lies in the fact that the loop variable `value` is being reassigned within the loop, causing unexpected behavior. Additionally, the formatting of the command string is incorrect, and it does not handle the case of an empty dictionary.

## Strategy for fixing the bug:
1. Use a separate variable for the inner loop to avoid reassigning the value variable.
2. Correctly format the command string without redundant quotes.
3. Handle the case of an empty dictionary gracefully.

## Corrected version of the function:
```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for key, val in value.items():
            command.append(f"{name} {key}={val}")
    return command
```
