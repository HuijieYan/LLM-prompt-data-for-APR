### Analysis:
The buggy function `_dict_arg` is intended to convert a dictionary into a list of command arguments. However, there are potential errors in the implementation that can cause bugs. 

### Potential Error Locations:
1. Reusing the variable `value` for both the dictionary value and the loop variable.
2. Incorrectly formatting the command string.

### Cause of the Bug:
The bug is caused by reusing the variable `value` within the for loop. This leads to unexpected behavior as the variable is overwritten, causing incorrect command formation.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
1. Use a separate variable in the for loop to avoid overwriting the dictionary value.
2. Format the command string correctly to ensure proper formatting.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, '"{0}={1}"'.format(prop, val)]
    return command
```

By using a separate variable `val` in the for loop and correctly formatting the command string, the bug in the `_dict_arg` function should be fixed.
