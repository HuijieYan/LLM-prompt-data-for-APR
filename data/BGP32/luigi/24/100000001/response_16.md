## Analyzing the buggy function:
The function `_dict_arg()` takes in a name and a dictionary value. It is supposed to construct a command list by iterating through the items in the dictionary and formatting them as key-value pairs within quotes. However, there are potential issues in the implementation that lead to bugs.

## Potential error locations:
1. The function reuses the variable name `value` within the loop, potentially causing conflicts.
2. The quotes around the key-value pairs might be causing incorrect formatting.

## Cause of the bug:
The bug in the function arises from the misuse of variable names within the loop and incorrect formatting of key-value pairs with quotes.

## Strategy for fixing the bug:
1. Avoid reusing variable names that are being used in a higher scope to prevent conflicts.
2. Remove unnecessary quotes around key-value pairs to format them correctly.

## Corrected version of the function:
```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for key, val in value.items():
            command += [name, "{0}={1}".format(key, val)]
    return command
```

Now, the corrected version of the `_dict_arg()` function properly formats key-value pairs without unnecessary quotes and avoids conflicts by using distinct variable names within the loop.
