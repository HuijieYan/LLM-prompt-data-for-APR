## Analyzing the buggy function:
The buggy function `_dict_arg` takes in a `name` and a `value`. It checks if the `value` is a dictionary and if it is, it iterates over the items in the dictionary and constructs a command by concatenating `name` with the key-value pairs in the dictionary. However, there is a bug in the function due to reusing the variable `value`.

## Error locations:
1. The variable `value` is being used both as the input argument and the loop variable, which can lead to unexpected behavior.

## Cause of the bug:
The cause of the bug is reusing the variable `value` for both the function argument and the loop variable. This can lead to the loop variable overwriting the function argument `value`, causing unexpected behavior.

## Strategy for fixing the bug:
To fix the bug, we can simply change the loop variable name from `value` to something else to avoid conflict with the function argument.

## Corrected version of the function:
```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: luigi/contrib/spark.py

def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, prop_value in value.items():  # Change loop variable name to avoid conflict
            command += [name, '"{0}={1}"'.format(prop, prop_value)]
    return command
```
