The issues in the provided function are related to the reassignment of variables `value` within the loop without considering the original dictionary value. This results in incorrect command generation. 

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, prop_value in value.items():  # Fixed variable name to avoid reassignment
            command += [name, '"{0}={1}"'.format(prop, prop_value)]  # Used prop_value instead of value
    return command
```

By changing the variable name within the loop from `value` to `prop_value`, we avoid reassigning the loop variable and ensure the correct values are used in constructing the command list. This corrected version should address the bug in the original function.
