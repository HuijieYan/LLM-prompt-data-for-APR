## Analysis:
The buggy function `_dict_arg` aims to convert a dictionary into a list of command arguments. However, there are potential errors in the function that need to be addressed. 

### Potential Error Locations:
1. The use of the variable name `value` both as a parameter and in the loop can lead to confusion and potentially overwrite the original `value` dictionary.
2. The formatting of the command arguments might be incorrect due to the way the key-value pairs are being concatenated.

### Cause of the Bug:
The bug in the function lies in the concatenation of the command arguments. The way the key-value pairs are being formatted and appended to the `command` list can result in incorrectly formatted arguments.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the key-value pairs are formatted correctly and added to the `command` list without overwriting any variables. A more clear and concise way of formatting the command arguments should be implemented.


## Corrected Version:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for key, val in value.items():
            command += [name, f'"{key}={val}"']
    return command
```

In the corrected version:
- Renamed the loop variables to `key` and `val` to avoid confusion with the original `value`.
- Utilized f-string formatting for a clearer and more concise way of building the command arguments.
- Ensured that the correct key-value pairs are formatted and added to the `command` list.

With these adjustments, the corrected function should now properly convert a dictionary into a list of command arguments without any bugs.
