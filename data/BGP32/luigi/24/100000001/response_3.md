## Analyzing the buggy function:
The function `_dict_arg` is designed to take a dictionary `value`, iterate over its key-value pairs, and construct a command list combining the name, property, and value. 

## Potential error locations:
1. Reusing the variable `value` as a loop variable: This can cause confusion and potential loss of the original `value` dictionary.
2. Incorrectly formatting the command string: The use of a double quote around the format string `{0}={1}` may cause issues with proper command string construction.

## Cause of the bug:
The bug in this function lies in mistakenly reassigning the loop variable `value` and using incorrect formatting of the command string, which may lead to unexpected results.

## Strategy for fixing the bug:
To fix the bug, we should use a different variable name in the loop to avoid overwriting the original `value` dictionary. We should also adjust the string formatting to ensure proper command string construction.

## Corrected version of the function:
```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, '{0}={1}'.format(prop, val)]
    return command
```

In the corrected version of the function, we have used `val` as the loop variable to avoid conflict with the original `value` dictionary. We have also adjusted the string formatting to properly construct the command string.
