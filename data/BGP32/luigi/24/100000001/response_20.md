## Analyzing the buggy function:
The function `_dict_arg` takes in a name and a dictionary as arguments, then iterates over the dictionary and appends a formatted string to a list `command` for each key-value pair in the dictionary. Finally, it returns the `command` list. The bug in this function lies in the line where the string is formatted using `"{0}={1}".format(prop, value)`. Due to the placement of the equal sign within the double quotes, the string is not well-formatted and might cause issues when used in subsequent commands.

## Identifying potential error location:
The main error lies in the formatting of the string inside the list where the equal sign is being enclosed within double quotes.

## Cause of the bug:
The issue is caused by incorrectly formatting the string within the list, leading to potential errors when the values are used in subsequent commands.

## Strategy for fixing the bug:
To fix the bug, the equal sign within the formatted string should be placed outside of the double quotes so that the string is formatted correctly.

## Corrected version:
```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, value in value.items():
            command += [name, '{0}={1}'.format(prop, value)]
    return command
``` 

In this corrected version, the equal sign is placed outside of the double quotes within the formatted string, ensuring the correct formatting of the key-value pairs in the `command` list.
