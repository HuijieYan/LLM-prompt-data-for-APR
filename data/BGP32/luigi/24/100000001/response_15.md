## Analyzing the buggy function:
- The function `_dict_arg` takes `name` and `value` as arguments.
- It checks if `value` is a dictionary and then iterates over its items.
- It creates a command list by concatenating the `name` with each key-value pair in the dictionary.

## Potential error locations:
1. The variable name `value` is reused in the loop causing ambiguity with the outer `value`.
2. The format used to concatenate `prop` and `value` might cause issues with formatting.

## Explanation of the bug:
- The bug arises because the inner `value` variable is overwriting the outer `value` parameter, leading to unexpected behavior in the loop. Additionally, the format used for concatenation may not produce the expected results.

## Fixing the bug strategy:
- Rename the inner `value` variable to avoid conflict with the outer variable.
- Modify the format string to ensure proper concatenation.

## Corrected version of the function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, "{0}={1}".format(prop, val)]
    return command
```
