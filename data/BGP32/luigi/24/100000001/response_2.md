## Analysis:
The buggy function `_dict_arg` is intended to create a list of command arguments based on the input dictionary `value`. It checks if `value` is not None and is an instance of a dictionary before iterating over its items and adding them to the `command` list. However, there are two potential issues in this function:
1. The variable `value` is used both as the input parameter and the iteration variable, which can lead to conflicts and unexpected behavior.
2. The formatting of the command string is not correct, as it includes unnecessary quotes around the key value pairs.

## Bug Cause:
The cause of the bug is that the function tries to use the variable `value` both as a dictionary to iterate over its items and as the iteration variable to retrieve key-value pairs. This reassignment of the iteration variable `value` leads to unexpected behavior and incorrect command formatting.

## Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to rename the iteration variable within the loop to avoid conflicts with the input parameter `value`. Additionally, we need to correct the formatting of the command string to remove unnecessary quotes around the key-value pairs.

## Corrected Version:
```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, "{0}={1}".format(prop, val)]
    return command
``` 

In this corrected version, I have renamed the iteration variable within the loop to `val` to avoid conflicts with the input parameter `value`. I have also corrected the formatting of the command string to remove unnecessary quotes, ensuring the output is correctly formatted command arguments.
