Potential error locations:
1. The function takes arguments `name` and `value` but uses the same variable name `value` for the dictionary iteration. This can cause conflict and overwrite the original value.
2. The format string `"{0}={1}"` is used, but the curly braces inside the string might cause issues when formatting.

Cause of the bug:
The bug in the function lies in the variable naming conflict, where the parameter `value` is being used for both the input value to the function and the iterating variable within the loop. This causes the original `value` to get overwritten during the loop, leading to incorrect behavior.

Strategy for fixing the bug:
1. Change the name of the iterating variable in the loop to something different from the function argument `value` to avoid conflicts.
2. Adjust the format string to resolve any issues with curly braces during formatting.

Corrected version of the function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, '{0}={1}'.format(prop, val)]
    return command
``` 

In this corrected version, the iterating variable within the loop has been changed to `val` to avoid conflicts with the input argument `value`. The format string has been adjusted to remove the unnecessary quotes around the values.
