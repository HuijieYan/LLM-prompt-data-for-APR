### Analysis:
The buggy function `_dict_arg` takes in a `name` and `value` as arguments. It checks if the `value` is a dictionary and if so, forms a list `command` by iterating over the key-value pairs in the dictionary. The issue in this function lies in the line where the command is being formatted using `name, '"{0}={1}"'.format(prop, value)`. The format string is incorrect as it is placing the key and value in a single string separated by an equal sign within double quotes. This can lead to unexpected behavior when the command is used in a different context.

### Potential Error Locations:
- Incorrect construction of the command list.
- Improper formatting of key-value pairs in the command.

### Cause of the Bug:
The bug is caused by the incorrect usage of formatting in constructing the command. Due to the improper formatting, the key-value pairs are concatenated in a way that might lead to issues when the command is utilized, especially if the values contain special characters.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, the formatting of the command string in the line `command += [name, '"{0}={1}"'.format(prop, value)]` needs to be modified. The key and value should be separated by an equal sign without being enclosed in double quotes individually.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, '{0}={1}'.format(prop, val)]
    return command
```

In the corrected version, the format string has been updated to `{0}={1}` to correctly represent a key-value pair without unnecessary quotes. This modification ensures that the command list is constructed appropriately for further processing without any unintended consequences.
