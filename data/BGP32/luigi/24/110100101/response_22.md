The issue in the buggy function is that the variable `value` is getting overwritten within the for loop, causing incorrect values to be added to the `command` list. To fix this issue, we need to use different variable names in the for loop to avoid overwriting the input `value`.

Here is the corrected version of the `_dict_arg` function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():  # use a different variable name (e.g., val) instead of value
            command += [name, '"{0}={1}"'.format(prop, val)]
    return command
```

By using a different variable name (`val`) in the for loop, we prevent the original `value` variable from being overwritten and ensure that the correct key-value pairs are added to the `command` list.

This corrected version should now pass the failing test cases provided.
