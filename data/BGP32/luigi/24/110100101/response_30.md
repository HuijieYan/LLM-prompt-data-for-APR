## Analysis
1. The buggy function `_dict_arg` takes two parameters `name` and `value`, where `value` is expected to be a dictionary. It iterates over the key-value pairs in the dictionary and constructs a list `command` based on the key-value pairs.
2. The buggy function seems to have an issue where it does not correctly format the key-value pairs from the dictionary into the desired format for the command list.

## Bug Explanation
The bug in the `_dict_arg` function lies in the way it constructs the command list. The current implementation uses `'{0}={1}'` to format the key-value pairs in the list, but it includes double quotes around the entire formatted string. This is incorrect for constructing command arguments in Python subprocess calls, as the entire argument should not be enclosed in double quotes.

## Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to remove the double quotes around the formatted key-value pairs in the command list. This will ensure that the constructed arguments are correctly formatted for passing to subprocess calls.

## Corrected Version
```python
import luigi

class SparkSubmitTask(luigi.Task):
    """
    Template task for running a Spark job
    
    Supports running jobs on Spark local, standalone, Mesos or Yarn
    
    See http://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/submitting-applications.html
    for more information
    """

    def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
        command = []
        if value and isinstance(value, dict):
            for prop, val in value.items():
                command += [name, '{}={}'.format(prop, val)]
        return command
```

By removing the double quotes around `{}` in the formatting string, the corrected version of the `_dict_arg` function ensures that the constructed command list will contain the key-value pairs in the correct format for passing to subprocess calls. This correction should fix the bug and allow the function to generate the expected command lists in the provided test cases.
