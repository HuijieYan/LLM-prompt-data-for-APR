The cause of the bug in the `_dict_arg` function is that the loop is using the same variable name `value` for the inner loop iteration, which is conflicting with the outer loop variable name `value`. This results in the inner loop overwriting the value of the outer loop, causing incorrect command generation.

To fix this bug, you can rename the inner loop variable from `value` to something else to avoid conflicts with the outer loop variable name. Here is the corrected version of the `_dict_arg` function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():  # change the inner loop variable name to 'val'
            command += [name, '"{0}={1}"'.format(prop, val)]
    return command
```

By changing the inner loop variable name to `val`, we prevent the conflict with the outer loop variable `value`. This corrected version should now generate the correct command list based on the input dictionary.
