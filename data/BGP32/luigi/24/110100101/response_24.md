### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_dict_arg` is supposed to generate a command based on a given name and dictionary value.
2. The function iterates over the key-value pairs in the dictionary and constructs command entries based on the format `name "key=value"`.
3. The bug occurs in the line `for prop, value in value.items():` where the variable `value` is being overwritten causing incorrect command generation.
4. The cause of the bug is that the loop variable `value` is the same as the function argument `value`, leading to unintended behavior as the loop progresses.
5. To fix the bug, we need to use a different variable name in the loop to avoid overwriting the function argument.

### Bug Fix:
```python
class SparkSubmitTask(luigi.Task):

    def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
        command = []
        if value and isinstance(value, dict):
            for prop, val in value.items():  # Changed variable name 'value' to 'val'
                command += [name, '"{0}={1}"'.format(prop, val)]
        return command
```

By modifying the loop variable to `val`, we ensure that the function argument `value` is not unintentionally modified during the loop execution. The corrected version of the function should now generate the correct command entries as expected.
