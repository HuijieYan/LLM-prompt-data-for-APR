### Analysis
The `_dict_arg` function is intended to construct a list of command line arguments based on a dictionary input. The function iterates over the dictionary items and appends key-value pairs formatted as strings to the `command` list. However, in the current implementation, the function uses the variable `value` for both the input dictionary and the inner loop iteration variable, causing issues with variable shadowing.

### Bug
The bug in the current implementation lies in the variable shadowing of `value` within the inner loop. As a result, the function incorrectly constructs the command list, leading to incorrect output.

### Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that different variables are used for the input dictionary and the iteration variable within the loop. It's important to avoid shadowing variables to maintain clarity and prevent unintended behavior.

### Corrected Version
```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():  # Use 'val' instead of 'value' to avoid shadowing
            command += [name, '"{0}={1}"'.format(prop, val)]
    return command
```

By using a different variable (`val`) for the inner loop iteration, we prevent shadowing issues and ensure that the command list is constructed correctly based on the input dictionary.
