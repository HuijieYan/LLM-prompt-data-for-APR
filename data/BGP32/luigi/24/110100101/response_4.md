The bug in the `_dict_arg` function is caused by reusing the variable name `value` in the loop to iterate over the dictionary items which overrides the original `value` parameter. This causes only the last key-value pair from the dictionary to be added to the `command` list.

To fix the bug, we should use a different variable name in the loop to avoid overwriting the original `value` parameter.

Here is the corrected version of the `_dict_arg` function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, prop_value in value.items():  # Changed variable name here to prop_value
            command += [name, '"{0}={1}"'.format(prop, prop_value)]
    return command
```

By changing the variable name to `prop_value` in the loop, each key-value pair from the dictionary will be correctly added to the `command` list.

This corrected version should pass both of the failing test cases provided.
