The bug in the `_dict_arg` function is caused by reusing the variable name `value` inside the loop which overwrites the input variable `value`. This leads to incorrect construction of the `command` list. 

To fix the bug, we should use a different variable name in the loop to avoid overwriting the input variable `value`.

Here is the corrected version of the `_dict_arg` function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():  # Using a different variable name here
            command += [name, '"{0}={1}"'.format(prop, val)]
    return command
```

By making this change, the function will now correctly construct the `command` list based on the input dictionary. This corrected version should pass both the failing test cases provided.
