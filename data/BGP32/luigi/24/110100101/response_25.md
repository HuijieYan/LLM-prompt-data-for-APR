The bug in the `_dict_arg` function arises from reusing the variable name 'value' inside the for loop, which overwrites the input parameter 'value' causing unexpected behavior. This results in only the last key-value pair of the input dict being processed and added to the command list.

To fix this bug, we should use a different variable name in the for loop to iterate over the input dictionary.

Here is the corrected version of the `_dict_arg` function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():  # using a different variable name 'val' in the loop
            command += [name, '"{0}={1}"'.format(prop, val)]
    return command
```

By changing the variable name in the for loop from 'value' to 'val', we prevent overwriting the input parameter value. This change ensures that all key-value pairs from the input dictionary are correctly processed and added to the command list.

This corrected version of the `_dict_arg` function should now pass the failing tests and satisfy the expected input/output values in both cases provided.
