The buggy function `_dict_arg` is supposed to convert a dictionary into a list of command arguments. However, there is a bug in the function as it is not handling the dictionary properly and not creating the command list correctly.

The bug is caused by reusing the variable name `value` inside the loop in the function `_dict_arg`. This causes the original `value` parameter to get overwritten and leads to incorrect command formation.

To fix this bug, we can simply rename the loop variable from `value` to something else, like `v`, to avoid the name conflict.

Here is the corrected version of the `_dict_arg` function:
```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, v in value.items():  # Rename the loop variable to avoid conflicts
            command += [name, '"{0}={1}"'.format(prop, v)]
    return command
```

With this fix, the function should correctly create the command list based on the input dictionary. This correction will ensure that the function behaves as expected in both test cases mentioned.
