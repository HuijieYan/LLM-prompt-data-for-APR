The bug in the `_dict_arg` function lies in the fact that the loop variable `value` is being overwritten by the inner loop. This leads to incorrect values being appended to the `command` list.

To fix this bug, we can simply rename the loop variable inside the inner loop to avoid overwriting the outer loop variable.

Here is the corrected version of the `_dict_arg` function:

```python
    def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
        command = []
        if value and isinstance(value, dict):
            for prop, val in value.items():  # Rename the loop variable from value to val
                command += [name, '"{0}={1}"'.format(prop, val)]
        return command
```

With this correction, the function should now pass the failing tests and produce the correct output for the given input values.
