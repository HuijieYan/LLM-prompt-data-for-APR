### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_dict_arg` is expected to construct a command list based on the input dictionary by formatting key-value pairs.
2. The function loops through the input dictionary and appends key-value pairs to the command list.
3. The bug seems to be related to using the same variable name `value` for the loop iteration and the value of the dictionary. This can lead to unexpected behavior.
4. To fix the bug, we need to differentiate the loop variable from the dictionary value.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is caused by using the same variable name `value` for both the loop iteration and the value within the dictionary. This can result in unexpected behavior when trying to extract the `prop` and `value` from the dictionary.

### Bug Fix:
To fix the bug, rename the loop variable inside the loop to something different from `value` to avoid conflict with the dictionary values.
