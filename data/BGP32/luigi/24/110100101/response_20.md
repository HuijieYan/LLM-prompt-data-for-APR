It seems that the buggy function `_dict_arg` is not correctly constructing the command list when the input `value` is a dictionary. The function is overwriting the `value` variable when iterating over the dictionary items, causing unexpected behavior.

To fix the bug, we need to change the variable names inside the loop to avoid overwriting the `value` parameter. Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, prop_value in value.items():  # Renamed variable to prop_value
            command += [name, '"{0}={1}"'.format(prop, prop_value)]
    return command
```

By renaming the variable inside the loop to `prop_value`, we ensure that we are correctly constructing the command list without overwriting the `value` variable.

This fix should address the issue identified in the failing test cases, allowing the function to generate the expected command list based on the input dictionary values.
