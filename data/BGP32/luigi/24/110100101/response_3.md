The bug in the `_dict_arg` function lies in the fact that the variable `value` is being reassigned within the loop that iterates over the dictionary items. This causes the function to only add the last key-value pair to the command list, resulting in incorrect output.

To fix this bug, we should use a different variable name for the inner loop iteration variable to avoid overwriting the `value` parameter. 

Here is the corrected version of the `_dict_arg` function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, '"{0}={1}"'.format(prop, val)]
    return command
```

By changing `value` to `val` in the inner loop, we ensure that the original value parameter is not overwritten. This correction will allow the function to correctly iterate over all key-value pairs in the input dictionary and build the command list accordingly.
