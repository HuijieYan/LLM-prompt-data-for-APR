The bug in the `_dict_arg` function is caused by reusing the variable name `value` in the loop where properties of the input dictionary are processed. This causes the original `value` parameter to be overwritten, leading to unexpected behavior.

To fix this bug:
1. Change the variable name inside the loop from `value` to something else to avoid reusing the same variable name.
2. Append the correct entries to the `command` list inside the loop.

Here is the corrected version of the `_dict_arg` function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, prop_value in value.items():
            command += [name, '"{0}={1}"'.format(prop, prop_value)]
    return command
```

By making these changes, the function should now correctly generate the command list for the given input dictionary.

Please integrate this corrected version into the `SparkSubmitTask` class in the `luigi/contrib/spark.py` file. This fix should address the bug and make the failing test cases pass as expected.
