The bug in the `_dict_arg` function lies in the fact that it modifies the input `value` dictionary while iterating over its items. This leads to unexpected behavior and incorrect output.

To fix this bug, we can use a different variable name for the inner loop iteration variable. Here is the corrected version of the `_dict_arg` function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():  # Use a different variable name (e.g., val) for inner loop iteration
            command += [name, '"{0}={1}"'.format(prop, val)]
    return command
```

By using a different variable name (`val`) in the inner loop, we prevent unintentional modifications to the `value` dictionary and ensure that the function correctly constructs the command list based on the input dictionary.

This corrected version should now pass the failing test cases provided.
