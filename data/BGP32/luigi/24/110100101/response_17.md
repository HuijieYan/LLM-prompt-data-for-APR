The bug in the `_dict_arg` function is due to using the same variable name `value` in both the outer loop and inner loop. This causes the outer loop to overwrite the `value` variable of the inner loop, leading to incorrect values being added to the `command` list.

To fix this bug, we need to rename the inner loop variable to something different to avoid overwriting the value. 

Here's the corrected version of the `_dict_arg` function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():  # rename the inner loop variable to val
            command += [name, '"{0}={1}"'.format(prop, val)]
    return command
```

With this correction, the function should now correctly construct the command list based on the input dictionary.

This updated version should pass both the provided failing tests and satisfy the expected input/output values.
