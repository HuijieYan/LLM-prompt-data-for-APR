Potential Error Locations:
1. The buggy function `_dict_arg` is not iterating over the dictionary `value` correctly. It is overwriting the `value` variable that is being used in the loop.
2. The string formatting in the line `command += [name, '"{0}={1}"'.format(prop, value)]` could cause issues with quotation marks in the final command.

Cause of the Bug:
The bug is caused by the incorrect iteration over the dictionary `value` in the `_dict_arg` function. Instead of adding each key-value pair to the `command` list with the specified `name`, it is only adding the last key-value pair due to the variable `value` being overwritten.

Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to adjust the iteration over the dictionary `value` and ensure that each key-value pair is correctly added to the `command` list with the specified `name`. We also need to handle the string formatting properly to avoid issues with quotation marks.

Corrected Version of the `_dict_arg` function:
```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, '"{0}={1}"'.format(prop, val)]
    return command
```
