The issue with the `_dict_arg` function is that the inner loop is using the same variable name `value` for the loop iteration and the dictionary value. This causes the dictionary value to be overwritten by the loop iteration value, leading to incorrect command generation.

To fix this issue, we need to use a different variable name for the loop iteration value. Here is the corrected version of the `_dict_arg` function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():  # Changed variable name from value to val
            command += [name, '"{0}={1}"'.format(prop, val)]
    return command
```

By changing the variable name in the loop from `value` to `val`, we ensure that the dictionary values are correctly used to generate the command list.

After applying this fix, the `_dict_arg` function should now correctly generate the command list based on the input dictionary values. This will make the failing test cases pass.
