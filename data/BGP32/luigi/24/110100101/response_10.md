The bug in the `_dict_arg` function lies in the variable names being reused, leading to incorrect values being appended to the `command` list. The inner loop variable `value` is being overwritten by the outer loop variable `value`, causing unexpected behavior.

To fix this bug, we should use distinct variable names for the inner loop and the outer loop. 

Here is the corrected version of the `_dict_arg` function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, '"{0}={1}"'.format(prop, val)]
    return command
```

By using `val` in the inner loop instead of `value`, we ensure that the correct values are added to the `command` list.

This corrected version should now pass both failing test cases provided.
