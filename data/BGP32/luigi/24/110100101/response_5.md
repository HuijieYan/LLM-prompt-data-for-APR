The bug in the `_dict_arg` function is due to the fact that the function is using the same variable name `value` for both the input parameter and the loop variable within the loop to iterate over the dictionary items. This causes the original `value` to be overwritten inside the loop, resulting in incorrect command generation.

To fix this bug, we need to use a different variable name for the loop variable to avoid overwriting the original `value`. Here is the corrected version of the `_dict_arg` function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, '"{0}={1}"'.format(prop, val)]
    return command
```

By using `val` instead of `value` as the loop variable, we avoid overwriting the original `value` parameter. This way, the function will correctly generate the command list based on the input dictionary.

After applying this fix, the function should pass the failing test cases provided above.
