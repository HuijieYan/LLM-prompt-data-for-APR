### Analysis:
1. The `_dict_arg` function takes a key-value pair dictionary as input and converts it into a list of command line arguments in the format `name key=value`.
2. The function iterates over the input dictionary, extracts the key and value pairs, and appends them to the `command` list.
3. The bug occurs in the line where the value is being appended to the `command` list. The issue is that the variable name `value` is being reassigned inside the loop, causing unexpected behavior.

### Bug:
The bug in the `_dict_arg` function is due to the reassignment of the variable `value` inside the loop. This leads to incorrect key-value pairs being added to the `command` list.

### Fix:
To fix the bug, we need to change the variable name in the loop from `value` to something else to avoid reassigning it. This can be accomplished by using a different variable name like `val` instead of `value`.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():  # Changed variable name from value to val
            command += [name, '"{0}={1}"'.format(prop, val)]
    return command
``` 

By changing the variable name inside the loop from `value` to `val`, we prevent the reassignment and ensure that the correct key-value pairs are added to the `command` list.
