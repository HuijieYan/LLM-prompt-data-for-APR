### Analysis:
1. The `_dict_arg` function is intended to convert a dictionary parameter into a list of command arguments.
2. The bug in the function is that it uses the same variable name `value` for both the dictionary input and the loop iteration over the dictionary items. This causes the function to overwrite the original `value`, leading to incorrect command generation.
3. The failing test cases expect the correct translation of dictionary values to command arguments, but due to the bug, the function is not producing the expected output.
4. To fix the bug, we need to use a different variable name for the loop iteration to prevent overwriting the original `value`.

### Bug Fix:
```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, prop_value in value.items():  # Changed variable name to prop_value
            command += [name, '"{0}={1}"'.format(prop, prop_value)]  # Use prop_value instead of value
    return command
``` 

By changing the variable name in the loop from `value` to `prop_value`, we prevent the overwriting issue and correctly generate the command arguments from the dictionary items. This fix should ensure that the function passes the failing test cases with the expected input/output values.
