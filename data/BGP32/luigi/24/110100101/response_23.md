### Analysis
The `_dict_arg` function is designed to take a `name` and a `value` parameter, where the `value` should be a dictionary. It is supposed to convert the dictionary entries into command line arguments to be used in the command. However, there are a few issues with the implementation:
1. The function reuses the variable `value` in the loop, which can cause unexpected behavior.
2. The value in the dictionary should be enclosed in quotes.
3. The key-value pairs should be formatted as key=value.

### Bug Explanation
The bug in the `_dict_arg` function lies in the loop where it constructs the command. The issue arises when the loop tries to access the key and value in the dictionary using the variables `prop` and `value`, respectively. These variables are reused inside the loop and do not hold the original values intended for constructing the command. This results in an incorrect command being generated without the proper formatting.

### Fix Strategy
To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the variables used in the loop are distinct and maintain their original values. Additionally, the key-value pairs should be properly formatted with quotes around the values and in the key=value format.

### Corrected Version
```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():  # change variable name to val to avoid reusing value
            command += [name, '"{0}={1}"'.format(prop, val)]  # format key-value pairs correctly
    return command
```
