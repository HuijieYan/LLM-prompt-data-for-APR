The bug in the `_dict_arg` function is that the inner loop overwrites the `value` variable which leads to incorrect command list formation. To fix this bug, the inner loop variable name should be changed and I will rename it to `prop_value` to prevent overwriting the `value` parameter.

Here is the corrected version of the `_dict_arg` function:
```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, prop_value in value.items():
            command += [name, '"{0}={1}"'.format(prop, prop_value)]
    return command
```

With this correction, the function will correctly build the command list for the given dictionary input, without overwriting any variables. This fix will ensure that the function can pass the failing test cases by correctly constructing the command list based on the input dictionary.
