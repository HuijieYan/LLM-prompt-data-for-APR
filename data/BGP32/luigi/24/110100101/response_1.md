The bug in the `_dict_arg` function is caused by using the same variable name `value` in the for loop, which overwrites the original `value` parameter. This causes the function to only handle the last key-value pair from the input dictionary.

To fix the bug, we need to replace the variable name `value` inside the for loop with a different name to avoid overwriting the original `value` parameter.

Here is the corrected version of the `_dict_arg` function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
        command = []
        if value and isinstance(value, dict):
            for prop, val in value.items():
                command += [name, '"{0}={1}"'.format(prop, val)]
        return command
```

By changing `value` to `val` within the for loop, we can correctly handle all key-value pairs from the input dictionary.

This corrected version should now pass the failing test cases by correctly constructing the command list with all key-value pairs from the input dictionary.
