The bug in the provided function `_dict_arg` lies in the fact that the inner loop variable is named the same as the outer loop variable causing a conflict in the scope of the function.

To fix the bug, we need to rename the inner loop variable to avoid conflicts with the outer loop variable. Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():  # change the variable name from value to val
            command += [name, '"{0}={1}"'.format(prop, val)]
    return command
```

With this fix, the function should now produce the correct output for the provided test cases.

Please update the `_dict_arg` function in the `luigi` package's `spark.py` file with the corrected version. This should resolve the bug and make the test cases pass successfully.
