The bug in the `_dict_arg` function lies in the fact that the same variable name `value` is being used in the loop to iterate over the dictionary and also to store the value of each key in that dictionary. This causes the original `value` parameter to be overwritten, leading to incorrect behavior.

To fix this bug, we need to rename the variable used inside the loop to avoid conflicts with the original `value` parameter. Here is the corrected version:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, '"{0}={1}"'.format(prop, val)]
    return command
```

By renaming the loop variable to `val`, we ensure that the original `value` parameter is not overwritten and the function works as intended.

This correction should now satisfy the expected input/output values provided in the test cases.
