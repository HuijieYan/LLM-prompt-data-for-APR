The bug in the `_dict_arg` function lies in the fact that the inner loop variable `value` is being overwritten by the outer loop variable `value`. This causes the function to incorrectly construct the command list.

To fix this bug, we can simply rename the inner loop variable to something distinct, such as `val` or `inner_value`.

Here is the corrected version of the `_dict_arg` function:

```python
class SparkSubmitTask(luigi.Task):
    def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
        command = []
        if value and isinstance(value, dict):
            for prop, val in value.items():
                command += [name, '"{0}={1}"'.format(prop, val)]
        return command
```

By fixing the variable naming in the inner loop, the function should now correctly construct the command list according to the input dictionary.

This corrected version should now pass both test cases provided.
