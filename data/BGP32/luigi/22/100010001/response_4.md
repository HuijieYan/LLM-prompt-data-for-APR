### Analysis:
The error message `TypeError: unsupported operand type(s) for +: 'NoneType' and 'int'` indicates that there is an issue with performing addition on a `NoneType` and an integer within the `prune` method of the `Worker` class in the `luigi/scheduler.py` file. The error is specifically occurring when trying to add `self.last_active` (which is initialized as None) with `config.worker_disconnect_delay` (which is an integer representing seconds).

### Bug Location:
The bug is located in the `prune` method of the `Worker` class, where an invalid operation is being attempted due to `self.last_active` being initialized to `None`.

### Cause of the Bug:
The bug is caused because the `last_active` attribute of the `Worker` class is initialized as `None` and then used in an arithmetic operation with an integer. Python does not support adding `None` with an integer, leading to the `TypeError`.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to initialize `self.last_active` with a value representing seconds since epoch (similar to `self.started = time.time()`). By doing so, the `self.last_active` will be of the correct type (integer), and the addition operation in the `prune` method will work correctly.

### Corrected Version:
Here is the corrected version of the `__init__` method in the `luigi/scheduler.py` file:

```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: luigi/scheduler.py

def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
    self.id = worker_id
    self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
    self.last_active = time.time() if last_active is None else last_active  # seconds since epoch
    self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
    self.tasks = set()  # task objects
    self.info = {}
```

By initializing `self.last_active` to `time.time()` if it is `None`, we ensure that it is always an integer representing seconds since epoch. This change will fix the bug and the `prune` method will be able to perform the addition operation correctly.
