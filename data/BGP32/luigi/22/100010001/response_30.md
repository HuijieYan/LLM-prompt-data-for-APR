### Analysis:
The error message indicates a `TypeError` where the unsupported operand types for addition are `'NoneType'` and `'int'`. This error occurs on the line `if self.last_active + config.worker_disconnect_delay < time.time():`. It suggests that `self.last_active` is of type `None` while `config.worker_disconnect_delay` is an integer. The problematic line tries to add `None` with an integer, leading to a `TypeError`.

### Bug Cause:
The `__init__` function in the `Worker` class initializes the `last_active` variable with a default value of `None`. This default value causes issues when calculating the worker's activity time, specifically when it is used in comparisons with integers.

### Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to handle the case where `last_active` is `None` gracefully. One approach is to initialize `last_active` with `0` instead of `None`, assuming that this represents the time before any activity. This change will ensure that we can safely compare it with other integer values.

### Corrected Version:
```python
# The correct version of the function with a default value for last_active
def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=0):
    self.id = worker_id
    self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
    self.last_active = last_active  # seconds since epoch
    self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
    self.tasks = set()  # task objects
    self.info = {}
```

By setting a default value of `0` for `last_active` in the `__init__` function, the corrected version ensures that the `last_active` attribute is initialized to a numeric value, allowing safe comparisons with other integers without raising a `TypeError`.
