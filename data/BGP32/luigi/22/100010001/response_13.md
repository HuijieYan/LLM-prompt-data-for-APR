### Analysis:
The error message indicates that the `self.last_active` attribute is a `NoneType`, while the `config.worker_disconnect_delay` is an integer. This leads to a `TypeError` when trying to add these two values together.

### Bug Location:
The bug exists in the `__init__` method of the `Worker` class. The `last_active` parameter is set to `None`, but it should be set to `time.time()` if no specific value is provided.

### Bug Cause:
The cause of the bug is that the `last_active` parameter is not receiving a default value of `time.time()` if no value is passed. Hence, it remains `None`, leading to the error at a later point where it is used in an arithmetic operation.

### Fix Strategy:
To fix this bug, we need to assign the default value for `last_active` as `time.time()` when no value is provided during the initialization of the `Worker` object.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
    self.id = worker_id
    self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
    self.last_active = last_active if last_active is not None else time.time()  # seconds since epoch
    self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
    self.tasks = set()  # task objects
    self.info = {}
```

By making this change, `last_active` will default to the current time if no value is passed, fixing the bug in the function.
