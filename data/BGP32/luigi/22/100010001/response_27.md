The bug in the provided function `__init__` causes a `NoneType` error in the `prune` method. The error occurs when trying to add `self.last_active`, which is initially set to `None`, to an integer value (`config.worker_disconnect_delay`). This results in the error message `TypeError: unsupported operand type(s) for +: 'NoneType' and 'int'`.

To fix this issue, we need to ensure that `self.last_active` is initialized with a valid value in the `__init__` function. One way to do this is to check if `last_active` is provided as an argument and set it to the current time if it is not provided.

Here is the corrected version of the function:
```python
# Corrected version of the buggy function
def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
    self.id = worker_id
    self.reference = None
    self.last_active = last_active if last_active is not None else time.time()  # Set to current time if last_active is None
    self.started = time.time()
    self.tasks = set()
    self.info = {}
```

With this modification, the `last_active` attribute will be initialized to the current time if no value is provided, preventing the `NoneType` error in the `prune` method.
