### Analysis:
The error message indicates that a `TypeError` is occurring in the line `if self.last_active + config.worker_disconnect_delay < time.time():`, specifically due to trying to add `NoneType` and `int` types together.

### Identified Bug:
The bug is within the `__init__` function where `last_active` is being set with a default value of `None`. This default value causes the issue because `self.last_active` is expected to be an integer when performing operations on it.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix this bug, ensure that `last_active` is always an integer value by providing an appropriate default value if one is not provided at initialization.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
    self.id = worker_id
    self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
    
    if last_active is None:
        last_active = time.time()  # set last_active to current time if not provided
    self.last_active = last_active  # seconds since epoch
    
    self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
    self.tasks = set()  # task objects
    self.info = {}
```

By setting `last_active` to `time.time()` if it is not provided, we ensure that `self.last_active` is always an integer, resolving the `TypeError` issue observed in the failing test.
