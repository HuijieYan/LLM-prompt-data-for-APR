### Analysis:
The error message indicates that there is a `TypeError` occurring when trying to add `self.last_active` (which is sometimes `None`) to an integer value. This suggests that `self.last_active` might not always be initialized properly.

### Error Location:
The issue lies in the `__init__` method where `self.last_active` is being set to `None` by default.

### Cause of the Bug:
The bug occurs because `self.last_active` is being initialized as `None`, which causes a `TypeError` when it tries to perform calculations with an integer.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
We need to ensure that if `last_active` is not provided during initialization, it should default to the current time in seconds (`time.time()`).

### Corrected Version:
```python
def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
    self.id = worker_id
    self.reference = None
    self.last_active = last_active if last_active is not None else time.time()
    self.started = time.time()
    self.tasks = set()
    self.info = {}
``` 

By updating the initialization of `self.last_active` to use `time.time()` when `last_active` is not provided, we ensure that it always has a valid time value.
