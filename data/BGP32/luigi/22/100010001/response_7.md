### Analysis:
The error message indicates a `TypeError` caused by trying to add an integer to a `NoneType`. This error occurs in the `prune` method of the `Worker` class due to `self.last_active` being initialized as `None`.

### Error Cause:
In the `__init__` method of the `Worker` class, the `last_active` attribute is set to `None`, causing the issue when attempting to calculate `self.last_active + config.worker_disconnect_delay` in the `prune` method.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to handle the case where `last_active` is not provided during initialization. One approach is to set a default value for `last_active` if it is not provided.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
    self.id = worker_id
    self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
    self.last_active = last_active if last_active is not None else time.time()  # seconds since epoch or current time if not provided
    self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
    self.tasks = set()  # task objects
    self.info = {}
``` 

By adjusting the initialization of `self.last_active`, we ensure that it is set to the current time if no specific time is provided, preventing the `NoneType` error when calculating the worker disconnect time. This corrected version should pass the failing test.
