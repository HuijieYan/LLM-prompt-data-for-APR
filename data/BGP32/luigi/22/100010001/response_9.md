The bug in the provided function `__init__` in the `Worker` class is that it initializes the `last_active` attribute as `None` by default and later performs arithmetic operations on it, causing a `TypeError` when trying to add `None` to an integer in the `prune` method. The error message indicates that the `last_active` attribute, which is initially `None`, is involved in a calculation with an integer.

To fix this bug, we should assign a default value of `0` to `last_active` when it is not explicitly provided during object initialization. This ensures that `last_active` is always an integer that can be used in arithmetic operations.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
    self.id = worker_id
    self.reference = None
    self.last_active = last_active if last_active is not None else 0
    self.started = time.time()
    self.tasks = set()
    self.info = {}
```

By assigning `0` to `last_active` when `None` is provided, we ensure that it is always an integer value. This fix should resolve the `TypeError` in the `prune` method.
