The bug in the code is due to the `last_active` attribute possibly being `None` when the `Worker` object is initialized, which leads to a `TypeError` when trying to add an integer to `None`.

To fix this bug, we can initialize `last_active` with a default value of `None` in the constructor of the `Worker` class and check if `last_active` is not `None` before performing the arithmetic operation.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
    self.id = worker_id
    self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
    self.last_active = last_active if last_active is not None else time.time()  # seconds since epoch
    self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
    self.tasks = set()  # task objects
    self.info = {}
```

This corrected version explicitly checks if `last_active` is `None` before assigning a value based on the current time using `time.time()`. This ensures that the arithmetic operation in the `prune` method will not raise a `TypeError` when `last_active` is `None`.
