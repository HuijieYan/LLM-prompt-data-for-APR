### Analysis:
The error message indicates a `TypeError` due to trying to perform an addition operation between a `NoneType` and an `int`. This error is likely caused by the initialization of `last_active` parameter in the `__init__` method of the `Worker` class with a default value of `None`.

### Identified Bug:
The bug lies in the fact that when creating a `Worker` object without providing the `last_active` parameter, `last_active` is initialized as `None` which is causing the issue during the prune operation.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we should ensure that when `last_active` is not provided during object creation, it should default to the current time in seconds since epoch.

### Corrected Version:
```python
# The corrected version
def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
    self.id = worker_id
    self.reference = None
    self.last_active = last_active if last_active is not None else time.time()  # seconds since epoch
    self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
    self.tasks = set()
    self.info = {}
```

By modifying the initialization of `last_active` to set the current time when `None` is passed as the default value, we can prevent the `TypeError` from occurring during the prune operation.
