## Analysis:
The error message indicates that in the `prune` method of the `Worker` class, there is an unsupported operand type error when trying to add `NoneType` (self.last_active) and an integer (config.worker_disconnect_delay).

## Bug Cause:
The bug occurs because the `last_active` attribute of the Worker instance is initialized as `None` in the `__init__` method, leading to the addition of `None` (NoneType) and an integer in the `prune` method, causing a TypeError.

## Fix:
Initialize `self.last_active` as `time.time()` in the `__init__` method, ensuring that it is an integer from the beginning.

## Corrected Version:
```python
def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
    self.id = worker_id
    self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
    self.last_active = last_active if last_active is not None else time.time()  # seconds since epoch
    self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
    self.tasks = set()  # task objects
    self.info = {}
```

By initializing `self.last_active = last_active if last_active is not None else time.time()`, we ensure that if the `last_active` parameter is not provided, it defaults to the current time instead of being `None`, fixing the bug. This change will allow the addition operation in the `prune` method to proceed without any TypeError.
