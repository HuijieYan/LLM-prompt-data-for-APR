### Analysis:
The error message indicates a `TypeError` occurring at line 245 of the `luigi/scheduler.py` file. The error arises when trying to add `self.last_active` (which is initially set as `None`) with an integer (`config.worker_disconnect_delay`).

### Bug Location:
The bug is in the `prune` method of the `Worker` class. Specifically, the `self.last_active` variable is initialized as `None` in the `__init__` method, and later this value is being used for addition in the `prune` method.

### Cause of the Bug:
The bug occurs because `self.last_active` is initialized as `None` in the `__init__` method, and then the addition operation is attempted with an integer value (`config.worker_disconnect_delay`). This leads to a `TypeError` saying that the operation is not supported between a `NoneType` and an `int`.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix this bug, `self.last_active` needs to have a default value other than `None` when initialized in the `__init__` method so that it can be directly compared and added to other integer values without errors.

### Corrected Version:
```python
# The corrected version of the buggy function
def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
    self.id = worker_id
    self.reference = None
    self.last_active = last_active if last_active is not None else time.time()  # Use the current time if last_active is not provided
    self.started = time.time()
    self.tasks = set()
    self.info = {}
```

In the corrected version, `self.last_active` now defaults to the current time if `last_active` is not provided during initialization. This ensures that `self.last_active` is always an integer value for comparison and addition operations.
