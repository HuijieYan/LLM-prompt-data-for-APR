### Analysis:
The error message indicates a `TypeError` due to the addition operation between `NoneType` and `int` in the `prune` method of the `Worker` class. This is caused by `last_active` being initialized as `None`.

### Error Location:
The error is occurring in the `prune` method due to the usage of `self.last_active`, which is initialized as `None`.

### Bug Cause:
The bug exists because the `last_active` attribute of the `Worker` class is not properly initialized or handled, leading to `None` being present during the addition operation in the `prune` method.

### Fix Strategy:
Initialize last_active explicitly when creating a new `Worker` instance. You can provide a default value for `last_active` in the `__init__` method.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
    self.id = worker_id
    self.reference = None
    self.last_active = last_active if last_active is not None else time.time()
    self.started = time.time()
    self.tasks = set()
    self.info = {}

def prune(self, config):
    if self.last_active + config.worker_disconnect_delay < time.time():
        # pruning logic
        pass
```

In this corrected version, if `last_active` is not provided during initialization, it defaults to the current time. This change ensures that the `last_active` attribute always has a valid value for comparisons.
