The bug in the given function is related to the `last_active` attribute being initialized as `None` by default and the function not handling this case properly when trying to add an integer value to it in the `prune` method. This causes a `TypeError` as you cannot perform arithmetic operations with a `None` type.

To fix the bug, we need to check whether `last_active` is None before trying to perform any arithmetic operations with it. We can set a default value for `last_active` if it is not provided during initialization.

Here is the corrected version:

```python
import time


class Worker:
    def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
        self.id = worker_id
        self.reference = None
        self.last_active = last_active if last_active is not None else time.time()  # Set default value if last_active is None
        self.started = time.time()
        self.tasks = set()
        self.info = {}

    def prune(self, config):
        if self.last_active is not None and self.last_active + config.worker_disconnect_delay < time.time():
            # Perform pruning logic here
            pass
```

With this correction, the `last_active` attribute is checked for `None` value before adding it to the current time in the `prune` method, preventing the `TypeError`.
