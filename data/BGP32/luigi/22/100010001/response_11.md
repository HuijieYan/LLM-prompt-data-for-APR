### Analysis:
The error message indicates a `TypeError` occurring in the `prune` function due to unsupported operand types `'NoneType'` and `'int'`. This suggests that `self.last_active` is possibly not initialized correctly and is `None`, causing the addition operation to fail when trying to compare it against `time.time()`.

### Bug Location:
The bug most likely lies in the `__init__` function where the `last_active` parameter is not being handled properly. If `last_active` is not provided, it should default to `None`.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is caused by not handling the case where `last_active` is not provided. In such cases, `self.last_active` is initialized as `None`, which leads to the error during the prune function.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to provide a default value of `None` for `last_active` if it's not provided when `Worker` object is initialized. This will ensure that the `prune` function can handle the comparison properly.

### Corrected Function:
```python
# Corrected __init__ function
def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
    self.id = worker_id
    self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
    self.last_active = last_active if last_active is not None else time.time()  # seconds since epoch or None
    self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
    self.tasks = set()  # task objects
    self.info = {}
```

By providing a default value of `None` for `last_active` and updating the assignment to consider this default value, the corrected function should now handle the case where `last_active` is not provided correctly. This fix should address the `TypeError` issue identified in the failing test.
