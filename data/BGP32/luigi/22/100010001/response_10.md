### Analysis:
The error message shows that there is a `TypeError` occurring in the `prune` method of the `Worker` class. Specifically, the error is happening in the line where there is an attempt to add `self.last_active` (which is `None`) to an integer value.

### Error Cause:
The `TypeError` occurs because `self.last_active` is initially set to `None` in the `__init__` method. Later, in the `prune` method, when it tries to calculate `self.last_active + config.worker_disconnect_delay`, Python is unable to add `None` and an integer directly.

### Fix Strategy:
To fix this bug, we need to ensure that `self.last_active` is assigned a default value that will allow for correct arithmetic operations when used in the `prune` method. For this case, setting `self.last_active` to `0` or another valid initial value would be a suitable fix.

### Corrected Version:
```python
import time

# The relative path of the buggy file: luigi/scheduler.py

# corrected version of the function
def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
    self.id = worker_id
    self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
    self.last_active = last_active if last_active is not None else 0  # seconds since epoch, setting to 0 if last_active is None
    self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
    self.tasks = set()  # task objects
    self.info = {}
``` 

Now, with this corrected version, the `last_active` value will default to `0` if `None` is passed, ensuring that arithmetic operations in the `prune` method will work correctly without raising a `TypeError`.
