### Analysis:
1. The `__init__` function receives `worker_id` and `last_active` as arguments. `last_active` is set to a default value of `None`.
2. The error message indicates a `TypeError`, specifically due to trying to add `NoneType` and `int` in the `prune` function.
3. The cause of the bug is that `last_active` is not properly initialized. Since `last_active` is initialized to `None`, adding `None` to an integer (`time.time()`) will result in a `TypeError`.
4. To fix the bug, we need to handle the case where `last_active` is `None`. One approach is to initialize `last_active` to `time.time()` if `last_active` is `None`.
   
### Fix:
Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
    self.id = worker_id
    self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
    self.last_active = last_active if last_active is not None else time.time()  # seconds since epoch
    self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
    self.tasks = set()  # task objects
    self.info = {}
```

By checking if `last_active` is `None`, setting it to `time.time()` if it is, we avoid the `TypeError` when trying to add `None` and an integer in the `prune` function.
