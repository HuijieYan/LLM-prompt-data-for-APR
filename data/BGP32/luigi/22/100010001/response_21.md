#### Analysis:
1. The error message indicates that there is a `TypeError` encountered during addition in the `prune` method of the `Worker` class.
2. The error is due to trying to add `NoneType` with an integer in the condition `self.last_active + config.worker_disconnect_delay < time.time()`.
3. The `last_active` attribute is initialized as `None` in the constructor of the `Worker` class, causing the error when adding `None` with an integer.
4. To fix the bug, we need to ensure that `last_active` is initialized to `time.time()` if it is provided as `None` during object creation.

#### Bug Fix:
We need to add a check in the constructor to set a default value for `last_active` if it is provided as `None`. Here is the corrected version of the `__init__` method:

```python
def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
    self.id = worker_id
    self.reference = None
    self.last_active = time.time() if last_active is None else last_active
    self.started = time.time()
    self.tasks = set()
    self.info = {}
```

By setting `self.last_active = time.time() if last_active is None else last_active`, we ensure that `last_active` is initialized to the current time if it is `None`, and this will prevent the `TypeError` encountered in the failing test.
