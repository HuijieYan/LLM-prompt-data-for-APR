The bug in the `__init__` function of the Worker class is caused because the `last_active` attribute is set to `None` if not provided during initialization. Later in the `prune` method, when trying to calculate `self.last_active + config.worker_disconnect_delay`, the addition operation raises a `TypeError` due to trying to add `NoneType` and an `int`.

To fix this bug, we need to handle the case when `last_active` is `None` and assign a default value instead. We can use `time.time()` as a default value in this case. 

Here is the corrected version of the `__init__` function:

```python
def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
    self.id = worker_id
    self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
    self.last_active = last_active if last_active is not None else time.time()  # seconds since epoch or time.time()
    self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
    self.tasks = set()  # task objects
    self.info = {}
```

By modifying the initialization line of `last_active` to use `time.time()` as a default value if `last_active` is not provided, we ensure that the addition operation in the `prune` method will not encounter a `TypeError`.

After making this correction, the `prune` method will be able to calculate `self.last_active + config.worker_disconnect_delay` correctly without any errors.
