### Analysis:
1. The error message indicates a `TypeError` caused by adding a `NoneType` and an `int` in the `prune` method of the `Worker` class.
2. The error occurs when trying to calculate `self.last_active + config.worker_disconnect_delay`.
3. The bug originates from the `__init__` method of the `Worker` class where the `last_active` attribute is initialized as `None`.
4. To fix the bug, it is necessary to ensure that `last_active` is set to a valid timestamp during initialization to avoid `NoneType` errors during calculations.

### Bug Fix:
```python
def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
    self.id = worker_id
    self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
    if last_active is None:
        self.last_active = time.time()  # Set current time if last_active is not provided
    else:
        self.last_active = last_active
    self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
    self.tasks = set()  # task objects
    self.info = {}
```

By modifying the `__init__` method to set `self.last_active` to the current time if it is not provided, we avoid the `NoneType` error when calculating `self.last_active + config.worker_disconnect_delay`. This modification ensures that the `last_active` attribute is always a valid timestamp.
