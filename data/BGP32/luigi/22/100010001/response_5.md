### Analysis:
- The error message indicates that a TypeError is raised due to unsupported operand types for addition. Specifically, it's trying to add a `NoneType` (self.last_active) with an `int` (config.worker_disconnect_delay).

### Identified Issue:
- The issue lies in the initialization of `last_active` as `None` and then trying to add it to an integer in the `prune` method.

### Cause of the Bug:
- The bug occurs because when `self.last_active` is `None`, you cannot directly add it to an integer value in Python, hence the TypeError.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
- To fix this bug, we need to check if `self.last_active` is `None` before trying to perform arithmetic operations on it. If it is None, we should handle this case appropriately without trying to add it to an integer.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
    self.id = worker_id
    self.reference = None
    self.last_active = last_active
    self.started = time.time()
    self.tasks = set()
    self.info = {}

def prune(self, config):
    if self.last_active is not None and self.last_active + config.worker_disconnect_delay < time.time():
        # Perform task pruning actions here
        pass
```

In the corrected version of the code above, the `prune` method now checks if `self.last_active` is not `None` before performing the addition with `config.worker_disconnect_delay`. This change will prevent the TypeError from occurring by making sure that only valid operands are used in the calculation.
