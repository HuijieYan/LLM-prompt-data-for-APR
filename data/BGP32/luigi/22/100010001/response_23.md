### Analysis:
1. The error message indicates a `TypeError` occurring in the `prune` method of the `Worker` class within the `luigi.scheduler.py` file.
2. The error is due to trying to add an integer value to a `NoneType`.
3. The bug is originating from the `__init__` method of the `Worker` class where the `last_active` parameter is initialized with a default value of `None`.
4. To fix the bug, we need to ensure that `last_active` always holds a valid integer value before performing any arithmetic operations on it.

### Fixing the Bug:
The bug can be fixed by providing a default `last_active` value that is an integer equivalent to an epoch time. This way, `last_active` will always have a valid value for comparison.

### Corrected Version:
```python
# The corrected version with the bug fixed
def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=time.time()):  # Providing default value as current epoch time
    self.id = worker_id
    self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
    self.last_active = last_active  # seconds since epoch
    self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
    self.tasks = set()  # task objects
    self.info = {}
```

By providing a valid default value for `last_active` in the `__init__` method, we ensure that arithmetic operations can be safely performed in other methods of the `Worker` class without encountering a `TypeError`.
