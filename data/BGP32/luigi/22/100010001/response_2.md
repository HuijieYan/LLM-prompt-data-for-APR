### Analysis:
1. The error occurs in the `prune` method when trying to calculate whether a worker should be deleted based on its last active time and the current time.
2. The cause of the error is that the `last_active` attribute is initialized as `None` in the `__init__` method, and we are trying to perform arithmetic operations with it later in `prune` method.
3. The error message states that the operation `self.last_active + config.worker_disconnect_delay` results in a `TypeError` due to unsupported operand types.
4. To fix the bug, we need to handle the case when `last_active` is `None` properly in the calculation.

### Bug Fix:
```python
def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
    self.id = worker_id
    self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
    
    if last_active is None:  # Handling the case when `last_active` is None
        self.last_active = time.time()  # Initialize last_active to current time
    else:
        self.last_active = last_active
        
    self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
    self.tasks = set()  # task objects
    self.info = {}
    
def prune(self, config):
    # Delete workers that haven't said anything for a while (probably killed)
    if self.last_active + config.worker_disconnect_delay < time.time():
        # Perform worker pruning logic here
        pass
```

By initializing `self.last_active` to the current time if `last_active` is `None`, we ensure that the arithmetic operation in the `prune` method does not result in a `TypeError`. This bug fix should resolve the issue and allow the test to pass successfully.
