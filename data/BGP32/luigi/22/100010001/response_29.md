The error message states that there is a "TypeError" occurring within the "prune" method of the Worker class in the luigi/scheduler.py file. The specific issue is arising from an unsupported operand type during an addition operation involving "NoneType" and "int".

The bug is due to the fact that the "last_active" attribute can be initialized to "None" in the __init__ method. When trying to calculate the time difference in the prune method, this attribute causes the TypeError.

To fix this bug, we need to handle situations where "last_active" might be set to "None" and ensure that it is properly initialized in a way that is compatible with the time calculations.

Here is the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
    self.id = worker_id
    self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
    self.last_active = last_active if last_active is not None else time.time()  # seconds since epoch
    self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
    self.tasks = set()  # task objects
    self.info = {}
```

In this corrected version, we are checking if the "last_active" parameter is None in the __init__ method and if it is None, we are initializing it to the current time using time.time(). This change ensures that "last_active" is always set to a valid time value during initialization.
