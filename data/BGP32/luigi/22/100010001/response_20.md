The error message indicates a `TypeError` due to trying to add `NoneType` and `int` data types. This error occurs because the `self.last_active` attribute is assigned `None` by default in the `__init__` function, and when trying to calculate `self.last_active + config.worker_disconnect_delay`, it results in this type mismatch.

To fix this bug, we need to initialize `self.last_active` differently to prevent this type mismatch error. One approach is to check if `last_active` is `None` in the `__init__` function, and if it is `None`, set it to 0 instead of `None`.

Here is the corrected version of the `__init__` function:

```python
def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
    self.id = worker_id
    self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
    if last_active is None:
        self.last_active = 0
    else:
        self.last_active = last_active
    self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
    self.tasks = set()  # task objects
    self.info = {}
```

With this correction, the `self.last_active` attribute is initialized to 0 if no value is provided, preventing the `TypeError` when trying to add `None` and `int`. 
After implementing this fix, the test case `test_worker_prune_after_init` should pass successfully.
