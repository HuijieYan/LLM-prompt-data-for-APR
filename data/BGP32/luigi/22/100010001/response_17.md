### Analysis:
The error message indicates a `TypeError` when trying to add `NoneType` and `int` in the condition `self.last_active + config.worker_disconnect_delay < time.time()`. This error happens because `self.last_active` is set to `None` when the `__init__` function is called, and then later on compared with an integer.

### Bug:
The bug is in the initialization of the `Worker` class constructor. The `last_active` parameter is set to `None`, leading to issues when comparing it with an integer value in the `prune` method.

### Fix:
To fix this bug, we need to check for `last_active` value before performing any arithmetic operations. If `last_active` is `None`, we will set it to `0` by default.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
    self.id = worker_id
    self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
    self.last_active = last_active if last_active is not None else 0  # seconds since epoch - set to 0 if None
    self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
    self.tasks = set()  # task objects
    self.info = {}
```

With this corrected version, the `last_active` attribute defaults to `0` if not provided, avoiding the `NoneType` issue. This should resolve the error and allow the `prune` method to function correctly.
