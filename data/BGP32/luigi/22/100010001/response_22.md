The bug in the provided function is caused by `last_active` being initialized as `None` and then used in a comparison operation with an integer value in the `prune` method of the `Worker` class. The error message indicates that `TypeError: unsupported operand type(s) for +: 'NoneType' and 'int'`.

To fix this bug, we need to ensure that `last_active` is always initialized to a valid integer timestamp value. One way to address this issue is to set `last_active` to the current time (integer timestamp) if it is not provided during initialization.

Here is the corrected version of the `__init__` method for the `Worker` class:
```python
def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
    self.id = worker_id
    self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
    
    if last_active is None:
        self.last_active = int(time.time())  # seconds since epoch if last_active is not provided
    else:
        self.last_active = last_active  # seconds since epoch
    
    self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
    self.tasks = set()  # task objects
    self.info = {}
```

By initializing `last_active` to the current time if it is not provided, we ensure that it is always a valid integer value. This will prevent any `NoneType` errors when comparing it with other integer values in the `prune` method.
