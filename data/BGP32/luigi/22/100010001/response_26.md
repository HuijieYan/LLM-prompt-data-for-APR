The bug in the provided function is due to the fact that the `last_active` parameter is initialized as `None` by default, and when trying to add it to an integer in the `prune()` method, it raises a `TypeError` since you cannot add `NoneType` and `int`.

To fix this bug:
1. Make sure to handle the case where `last_active` is `None` in the `prune()` method.
2. Consider setting a default value for `last_active` in the `__init__` method to avoid potential issues in the future.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
    self.id = worker_id
    self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
    self.last_active = last_active if last_active is not None else time.time()  # seconds since epoch
    self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
    self.tasks = set()  # task objects
    self.info = {}

def prune(self, config):
    # Delete workers that haven't said anything for a while (probably killed)
    if self.last_active is not None and self.last_active + config.worker_disconnect_delay < time.time():
        # prune the worker
        pass  # add the pruning logic here
```

By setting `last_active` to `time.time()` if the provided value is `None`, we ensure that it always contains a valid timestamp. In the `prune()` method, we also check if `last_active` is not `None` before performing any calculations involving it to avoid the `TypeError`.
