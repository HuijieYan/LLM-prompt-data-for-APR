The bug in the provided function is caused by the fact that the `last_active` parameter in the constructor can be `None`, but in the `prune` method it is used without checking if it has a valid value. This leads to a `TypeError` when trying to add an integer to a `NoneType`.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the `prune` method to handle cases where `last_active` is `None`. We can add a check to ensure that `last_active` is not `None` before performing the calculation with `config.worker_disconnect_delay`.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
    self.id = worker_id
    self.reference = None
    self.last_active = last_active if last_active is not None else 0
    self.started = time.time()
    self.tasks = set()
    self.info = {}
    
def prune(self, config):
    if self.last_active is not None and self.last_active + config.worker_disconnect_delay < time.time():
        # Perform the pruning logic
        pass
```

With this modification, the function will handle cases where `last_active` is `None` and set it to `0` internally to avoid the `TypeError`. This should resolve the issue and make the test case pass successfully.
