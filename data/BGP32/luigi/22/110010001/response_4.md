1. The buggy function is the `__init__` method of the `Worker` class in the `luigi.scheduler` module. The error message occurs when calling the `prune` method later on, which is not shown in the buggy code snippet. The issue is related to the `last_active` attribute being set to `None` by default in the `__init__` method.

2. The potential error location is the line that compares `self.last_active` with the current time in the `prune` method. 

3. The cause of the bug is that the `__init__` method sets `last_active` to `None` by default. When trying to compare `None` with an integer (current time in seconds), it raises a `TypeError` stating that you can't add `NoneType` and `int` together.

4. A strategy for fixing the bug is to provide a default value for `last_active` that is an integer (preferably the epoch time when the worker was created) instead of `None`. This will ensure that `last_active` is always initialized to a valid integer value.

5. Here is the corrected version of the `__init__` method for the `Worker` class:

```python
class Worker(object):
    """
    Structure for tracking worker activity and keeping their references.
    """

    def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
        self.id = worker_id
        self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
        self.last_active = last_active if last_active is not None else time.time()  # seconds since epoch or current time
        self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        self.tasks = set()  # task objects
        self.info = {}
```

With this correction, the `last_active` attribute will be initialized to the current time if no value is provided, avoiding the `TypeError` when comparing it with the current time in the `prune` method.
