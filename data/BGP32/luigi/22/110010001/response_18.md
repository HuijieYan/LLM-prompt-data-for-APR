1. The buggy function `__init__` is part of the `Worker` class in the `luigi/scheduler.py` file. The buggy function initializes instances of the `Worker` class with the provided `worker_id` and default values for other attributes like `last_active`, `started`, `tasks`, and `info`.

2. The potential error is occurring in the `__init__` function where the `last_active` attribute is set to `None`, causing a `TypeError` later in the code when trying to add `NoneType` to an integer in the `prune` method. The `prune` method checks if a worker has been inactive for a certain duration and deletes it if necessary.

3. The cause of the bug is that when `self.last_active` is set to `None` in the `__init__` function, it cannot be added to an integer in the `prune` method when evaluating if the worker should be pruned based on the time of inactivity. This leads to a `TypeError` when trying to add `NoneType` and an integer.

4. To fix the bug, we need to update the initialization of `self.last_active` to be a valid timestamp (seconds since epoch) instead of `None`. One approach is to set it to the same value as `self.started` during initialization.

5. Here is the corrected version of the `__init__` function within the `Worker` class:

```python
class Worker(object):
    """
    Structure for tracking worker activity and keeping their references.
    """

    def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
        self.id = worker_id
        self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
        self.last_active = last_active if last_active is not None else time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        self.tasks = set()  # task objects
        self.info = {}
```

By setting `self.last_active = last_active if last_active is not None else time.time()`, we ensure that `self.last_active` is either the provided `last_active` value or the current time in seconds since epoch if `last_active` is `None`. This way, the `prune` method will not encounter a `TypeError` when checking for inactivity based on time.
