1. The buggy function is the `__init__` method of the `Worker` class in the `luigi.scheduler` module. The error message is indicating that there is a `TypeError` when trying to add `None` to an integer in the `prune` method of the `Worker` class.

2. The potential error location is the line `self.last_active = last_active` where the `last_active` parameter can be `None`. Later in the code, the issue arises when trying to add `None` to an integer.

3. The cause of the bug is that when the `last_active` parameter is not provided during the initialization of a `Worker` instance, it defaults to `None`. Subsequently, in the `prune` method, there is an attempt to add `None` to a constant delay value, resulting in a `TypeError`.

4. To fix this bug, we need to check if the `last_active` parameter is `None` during initialization and assign the current time in seconds since epoch in such cases.

5. Here is the corrected version of the `__init__` method in the `Worker` class:

```python
# The corrected version of the buggy function

class Worker(object):
    """
    Structure for tracking worker activity and keeping their references.
    """

    def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
        self.id = worker_id
        self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
        
        if last_active is not None:
            self.last_active = last_active
        else:
            self.last_active = time.time()  # If last_active is None, set it to current time
        
        self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        self.tasks = set()  # task objects
        self.info = {}
```

This corrected version checks if `last_active` is `None` and assigns the current time in seconds since epoch when needed. This modification ensures that the `last_active` attribute is always initialized properly, fixing the `TypeError` that was occurring during the `prune` method.
