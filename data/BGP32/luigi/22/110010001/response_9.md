### Analysis:
The buggy function `__init__` initializes the `last_active` attribute with a default value of `None`. This default value causes issues when trying to perform arithmetic operations with it later in the `prune` method. The error message indicates a `TypeError` due to trying to add `None` and an integer value.

### Error Location:
The error is occurring in the `prune` method, specifically at the line where the code attempts to add `self.last_active` (which is `None` by default) and `config.worker_disconnect_delay`.

### Cause of the Bug:
The cause of the bug is the initialization of `last_active` with `None` in the `__init__` method. This default value is incompatible with arithmetic operations.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix this bug, the `last_active` attribute should be assigned with an appropriate initial value that can be used in arithmetic operations later in the `prune` method.

### Corrected Version:
Here is the corrected version of the `__init__` method where `last_active` is initialized with the current time if no value is provided:

```python
# The declaration of the class containing the buggy function
class Worker(object):
    """
    Structure for tracking worker activity and keeping their references.
    """




    # this is the buggy function you need to fix
    def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
        self.id = worker_id
        self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
        self.last_active = last_active if last_active is not None else time.time()  # seconds since epoch or current time
        self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        self.tasks = set()  # task objects
        self.info = {}
```

By assigning the current time to `last_active` if no value is provided, we ensure compatibility with arithmetic operations later in the `prune` method.
