1. The buggy function is the `__init__` method of the `Worker` class in the `luigi/scheduler.py` file. The error message is a `TypeError` occurring when trying to add a `NoneType` to an `int` in the `prune` method, due to the `last_active` attribute being initialized as `None`.

2. The potential error location is in the initialization of the class attributes, particularly the `last_active` attribute, which is set to `None`. This leads to issues when trying to use it in other methods that expect it to be an integer representing seconds since epoch.

3. The cause of the bug is that the `last_active` attribute is initialized as `None`, causing a `TypeError` when trying to perform an addition operation with it in the `prune` method. The error message is clear in pointing out that the addition operation is between a `NoneType` and an `int`, which is not supported.

4. To fix the bug, we need to ensure that `last_active` is properly initialized as an integer representing seconds since epoch. One potential strategy is to assign the current time (seconds since epoch) to `last_active` if it is passed as `None` during instantiation.

5. Here's the corrected version of the `Worker` class:

```python
class Worker(object):
    """
    Structure for tracking worker activity and keeping their references.
    """

    def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
        self.id = worker_id
        self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
        self.last_active = last_active if last_active is not None else time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        self.tasks = set()  # task objects
        self.info = {}
```

This corrected version ensures that `last_active` is set to the current time in seconds since epoch if it is passed as `None` during instantiation.
