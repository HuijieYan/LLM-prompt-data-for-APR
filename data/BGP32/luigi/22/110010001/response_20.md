1. The buggy function `__init__` within the `Worker` class is causing an issue where the `last_active` attribute is assigned a default value of `None`, leading to a `TypeError` when trying to perform arithmetic operations on it in the `prune` method.
   
2. The potential error location is the initialization of the `last_active` attribute within the `__init__` method, where it is set to `None` which causes the issue when used in the `prune` method.

3. The bug occurs because the `last_active` attribute is initialized as `None` in the `__init__` method of the `Worker` class. When attempting to add `config.worker_disconnect_delay` to it in the `prune` method, it encounters a `TypeError` as `None` cannot be added to an integer.

4. To fix the bug, we need to handle the case where `last_active` might be `None` in the `prune` method. We can set a default value for `last_active` if it is not provided during initialization.

5. Here is the corrected version of the `Worker` class with the bug fixed:

```python
class Worker:
    """
    Structure for tracking worker activity and keeping their references.
    """

    def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
        self.id = worker_id
        self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
        self.last_active = last_active or time.time()  # seconds since epoch or current time
        self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        self.tasks = set()  # task objects
        self.info = {}

    def prune(self, config):
        if self.last_active is not None and self.last_active + config.worker_disconnect_delay < time.time():
            # Perform pruning operation if last_active is not None
            pass
```

This corrected version sets `last_active` to the current time if it is `None`, ensuring that arithmetic operations can be performed on it without encountering a `TypeError`. Additionally, a check is added in the `prune` method to ensure that `last_active` is not `None` before performing the operation.
