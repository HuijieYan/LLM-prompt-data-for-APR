1. The buggy function `__init__` within the `Worker` class has an issue with the initialization of the `last_active` attribute. It is set to `None` by default in the constructor signature, but later in the function, it is used in a comparison which leads to a `TypeError`.

2. The error occurs when trying to compare `self.last_active + config.worker_disconnect_delay` with `time.time()`. Since `self.last_active` is `None`, it causes the `TypeError` because `None` cannot be added to an `int`.

3. The bug is caused by the default initialization of `last_active` as `None` in the `__init__` function. When this value is later compared with an integer in the `prune` method, it results in a `TypeError`.

4. To fix this bug, we can modify the assignment of `last_active` in the `__init__` function. Instead of setting it to `None`, we can use `time.time()` as the default value, ensuring it is already an integer for comparison later in the code.

5. Here is the corrected version of the `__init__` function:

```python
# The corrected version of the __init__ function
def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
    self.id = worker_id
    self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
    if last_active is None:
        last_active = time.time()  # Set default value if last_active is None
    self.last_active = last_active
    self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
    self.tasks = set()  # task objects
    self.info = {}
``` 

By setting the default value of `last_active` to `time.time()` if it is `None`, we ensure that it is always an integer and can be compared properly in other functions like `prune`.
