### Analysis:
1. The buggy function is the `__init__` method of the `Worker` class in the `luigi/scheduler.py` file. The function initializes a `Worker` object with certain attributes.
2. The error message occurs in the `test_worker_prune_after_init` test method of the `SchedulerTest` class, where the `prune` method is called on a `Worker` object. The error happens because the `last_active` attribute in the `Worker` object is initially set to `None`, which causes a `TypeError` when trying to perform arithmetic operations with it.
3. The cause of the bug is due to the `last_active` attribute being initialized as `None` by default, and later the code tries to add an `int` value to it, resulting in a `NoneType` and `int` combination error.
4. To fix the bug, we should set `last_active` to the current time (as an integer) if it is not provided during object creation.
   
### Corrected Version:
```python
class Worker(object):
    """
    Structure for tracking worker activity and keeping their references.
    """

    def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
        self.id = worker_id
        self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
        self.last_active = last_active if last_active is not None else int(time.time())  # seconds since epoch
        self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        self.tasks = set()  # task objects
        self.info = {}
``` 

By setting `self.last_active = last_active if last_active is not None else int(time.time())`, we ensure that `last_active` is initialized to the current time if it is not provided during object creation, resolving the `NoneType` and `int` issue.
