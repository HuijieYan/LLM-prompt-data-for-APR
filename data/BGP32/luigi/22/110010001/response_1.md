1. The buggy function is the `__init__` method within the `Worker` class in the `luigi/scheduler.py` file. The function initializes instances of the `Worker` class with a `worker_id`, `last_active`, etc.

2. The potential error location is at the line `if self.last_active + config.worker_disconnect_delay < time.time():`, specifically involving the addition operation using `self.last_active` which can be `None` in some cases.

3. The cause of the bug is due to the fact that the `last_active` attribute is initialized as `None` in the `__init__` function. When an attempt is made to add `config.worker_disconnect_delay` (assumed to be an integer) to `self.last_active`, it results in a `TypeError` due to the unsupported operand types for the addition operation ('NoneType' and 'int'). The error message clearly explains this issue.

4. To fix the bug, we need to handle the case where `last_active` is `None` by first checking if it is not `None` before performing the addition operation with `worker_disconnect_delay`.

5. Here is the corrected version of the `__init__` method within the `Worker` class:
```python
class Worker(object):

    def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
        self.id = worker_id
        self.reference = None
        self.last_active = last_active
        self.started = time.time()
        self.tasks = set()
        self.info = {}

    def prune(self, config):
        # Delete workers that haven't said anything for a while (probably killed)
        if self.last_active is not None and self.last_active + config.worker_disconnect_delay < time.time():
            # Perform the operation only if last_active is not None
            pass  # Placeholder for pruning logic
```

By checking if `self.last_active` is not `None` before attempting the addition, we prevent the `TypeError` from occurring and ensure that the comparison is done correctly.
