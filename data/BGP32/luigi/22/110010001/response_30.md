1. The buggy function is the `prune` method within the `Worker` class in the `luigi/scheduler.py` file. The error message indicates that there is a TypeError when trying to add `NoneType` and `int` together within the `prune` method.

2. Potential error locations within the `prune` method involve the use of `self.last_active`, which is initialized to `None` in the `__init__` method. This `None` can cause issues when trying to add it to an integer value in the `prune` method.

3. The bug is caused by the fact that `self.last_active` is set to `None` in the `__init__` method, and when trying to compare it with an integer (config.worker_disconnect_delay) in the `prune` method, it results in a TypeError due to unsupported operand types.

4. One strategy to fix this bug is to set a default value for `last_active` in the `__init__` method, such as 0 (if there is no specific requirement for `last_active` to be `None` initially). This way, `last_active` will always be an integer value, avoiding the TypeError when performing arithmetic operations.

5. Here is the corrected version of the `__init__` method and the `prune` method:

```python
class Worker(object):
    """
    Structure for tracking worker activity and keeping their references.
    """

    def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=0):
        self.id = worker_id
        self.reference = None
        self.last_active = last_active
        self.started = time.time()
        self.tasks = set()
        self.info = {}

    def prune(self, config):
        if self.last_active + config.worker_disconnect_delay < time.time():
            # Pruning logic goes here
            pass
```

By setting a default value of 0 for `last_active` in the `__init__` method, we ensure that it is always an integer. This change should prevent the TypeError when comparing with integer values in the `prune` method.
