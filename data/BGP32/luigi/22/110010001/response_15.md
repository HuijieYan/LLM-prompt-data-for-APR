### Analysis:
The error message is pointing to the line where the addition operation is happening between `self.last_active` and `config.worker_disconnect_delay`. The error specifically states that the addition operation is being attempted between a 'NoneType' and an 'int', which means that `self.last_active` is set to `None`. The buggy function initializes `last_active` with a default value of `None`, but it is not properly handling this case when performing operations.

### Bug Cause:
The bug occurs because when `last_active` is set to `None`, the program encounters an error when trying to add an integer (`config.worker_disconnect_delay`) to `None`.

### Bug Fix:
To fix this bug, we need to handle the case when `last_active` is `None` properly. One approach is to check if `last_active` is `None` and assign the current time instead. Another approach is to set `last_active` to the current time by default if no value is provided.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
class Worker(object):
    """
    Structure for tracking worker activity and keeping their references.
    """

    def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
        self.id = worker_id
        self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
        self.last_active = last_active if last_active is not None else time.time()  # seconds since epoch or current time
        self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        self.tasks = set()  # task objects
        self.info = {}

    def prune(self, config):
        # Delete workers that haven't said anything for a while (probably killed)
        if self.last_active + config.worker_disconnect_delay < time.time():
            # Prune the worker
            pass  # Placeholder for actual pruning logic
```

By updating the constructor logic to handle the case where `last_active` is not provided, the corrected version ensures that `last_active` defaults to the current time if no value is specified. This change should prevent the error encountered in the failing test case.
