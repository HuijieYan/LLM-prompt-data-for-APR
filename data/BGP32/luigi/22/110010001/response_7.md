1. The buggy function is the `__init__` method of the `Worker` class. The error message is generated from the `prune` method called in the failing test. The error is a `TypeError` caused by trying to add a `NoneType` and an `int` in the `prune` method.

2. The potential error location is the `self.last_active` attribute that is initialized to `None` in the `__init__` method of the `Worker` class.

3. The cause of the bug is that the `last_active` attribute is set to `None` by default. When attempting to add this `None` value and an `int` representing seconds since epoch in the `prune` method, it results in a `TypeError`.

4. To fix the bug, we need to ensure that `last_active` is properly initialized to an integer representing seconds since epoch so that it can be added with other integers without causing a `TypeError`.

5. Here is the corrected version of the `__init__` method of the `Worker` class:

```python
class Worker(object):
    """
    Structure for tracking worker activity and keeping their references.
    """

    def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
        self.id = worker_id
        self.reference = None
        self.last_active = last_active if last_active is not None else time.time()  # Initializing last_active to current time if None
        self.started = time.time()
        self.tasks = set()
        self.info = {}
```

With this correction, the `last_active` attribute will default to the current time if not provided, ensuring that it is always an `int` representing seconds since epoch. This adjustment will prevent the `TypeError` encountered in the failing test scenario.
