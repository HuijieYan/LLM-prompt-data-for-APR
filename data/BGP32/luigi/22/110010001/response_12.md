1. The buggy function is the `__init__` constructor within the `Worker` class in the `luigi/scheduler.py` file. The error message indicates a `TypeError` related to unsupported operand types during addition. The issue seems to be with the addition operation involving `self.last_active` and `config.worker_disconnect_delay`.

2. The potential error location is identified in the line where `self.last_active` is being accessed in the `prune` method.

3. The cause of the bug is as follows:
   - In the `__init__` function of the `Worker` class, `last_active` parameter is set to `None` by default.
   - When `worker.prune()` method is called in the test, it tries to access `self.last_active` (which is `None`) and add `config.worker_disconnect_delay` to it with the intention of checking if the worker should be pruned.
   - The addition operator (`+`) encounters an operand of type `NoneType`, leading to the `TypeError`.

4. To fix the bug, we need to modify the `prune` method to handle the case where `last_active` might be `None`. We can do this by first checking if `self.last_active` is `None` before performing the addition.

5. Here is a corrected version of the `Worker` class with the fix implemented:

```python
class Worker(object):
    def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
        self.id = worker_id
        self.reference = None
        self.last_active = last_active
        self.started = time.time()
        self.tasks = set()
        self.info = {}
        
    def prune(self, config):
        # Delete workers that haven't said anything for a while (probably killed)
        if self.last_active is not None and self.last_active + config.worker_disconnect_delay < time.time():
            # Perform pruning action here
            pass
```

In the corrected version, before performing the addition, we first check if `self.last_active` is not `None`. This way, we handle the case where the `last_active` attribute is `None` appropriately.
