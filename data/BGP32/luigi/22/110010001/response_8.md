### Analysis:
1. The buggy function is the `__init__` method of the `Worker` class in the `luigi.scheduler` module.
2. The error message is a `TypeError` related to unsupported operand types for addition.
3. The error occurs when trying to add `self.last_active` (which is initialized as `None`) to an integer (`config.worker_disconnect_delay`).
4. The bug is caused by attempting to add `None` to an integer, resulting in a type mismatch.
5. To fix the bug, we need to handle the case where `last_active` is `None` and avoid performing addition in that scenario.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
1. Check if `self.last_active` is `None` in the `prune` method before performing the addition.
2. If `last_active` is `None`, simply skip the addition and return `False` (indicating that the worker should not be pruned yet).
3. If `last_active` is not `None`, proceed with the original logic to check if the worker should be pruned based on the configured delay.

### Corrected Version:
```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: luigi/scheduler.py

class Worker(object):
    """
    Structure for tracking worker activity and keeping their references.
    """

    def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
        self.id = worker_id
        self.reference = None
        self.last_active = last_active
        self.started = time.time()
        self.tasks = set()
        self.info = {}

    def prune(self, config):
        if self.last_active is None:
            return False  # worker hasn't been active, so no need to prune
        elif self.last_active + config.worker_disconnect_delay < time.time():
            return True  # worker should be pruned
        else:
            return False  # worker should not be pruned yet
```

With this correction, the addition in the `prune` method will only be attempted if `self.last_active` is not `None`, avoiding the `TypeError` and ensuring that the worker pruning logic works correctly.
