### Analysis:
1. The buggy function is the `__init__` constructor in the `Worker` class of the `luigi` package.
2. The error message is a `TypeError` indicating that there is an issue with the addition operation between a `NoneType` and an `int` in the `prune` method.
3. The cause of the bug is that the `last_active` attribute in the `Worker` class is assigned a default value of `None`, causing the addition operation in the `prune` method to fail when trying to add `None` with an integer (`config.worker_disconnect_delay < time.time()`). This results in the `TypeError`.
4. The strategy for fixing the bug is to provide a default value that can be added with an integer when initializing the `last_active` attribute to ensure that it is always a valid `int` value.

### Corrected Version:
```python
# The corrected version of the buggy function

class Worker(object):

    def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=0):  # Assign default value of 0 instead of None
        self.id = worker_id
        self.reference = None
        self.last_active = last_active
        self.started = time.time()
        self.tasks = set()
        self.info = {}
``` 

By setting the default value of `last_active` to 0 instead of `None`, the issue of trying to add `None` with an integer when pruning workers will be resolved. This corrected version should now pass the failing test.
