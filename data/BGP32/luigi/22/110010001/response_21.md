1. The buggy function is the `__init__` method of the `Worker` class in the `luigi/scheduler.py` file. The error message indicates a `TypeError` occurring when adding a NoneType to an integer.

2. The potential error location is identified in the line where `self.last_active + config.worker_disconnect_delay < time.time()` is calculated in the `prune` method.

3. The cause of the bug is that the `last_active` attribute is being initialized with a default value of `None` in the `__init__` method. When trying to add the `config.worker_disconnect_delay` (which is an integer) to `None`, it results in a `TypeError` during the comparison operation.

4. To fix the bug, we need to ensure that `last_active` is initialized with a valid value (preferably a timestamp) instead of `None`.

5. Here is the corrected version of the `__init__` method in the `Worker` class:

```python
class Worker(object):
    """
    Structure for tracking worker activity and keeping their references.
    """

    def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
        self.id = worker_id
        self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
        self.last_active = last_active if last_active is not None else time.time()  # seconds since epoch if not provided
        self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        self.tasks = set()  # task objects
        self.info = {}
```

In the corrected version, we check if `last_active` is provided during initialization. If it is provided, we use that value; otherwise, we set it to the current timestamp using `time.time()`. This ensures that `last_active` is always a valid timestamp and avoids the `TypeError` when comparing it with an integer in the `prune` method.
