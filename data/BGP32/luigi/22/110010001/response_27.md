1. Analysis:
The buggy function is the `__init__` method of the `Worker` class in the `luigi.scheduler` module. The error message indicates a `TypeError` in the `prune` method, specifically when trying to add `config.worker_disconnect_delay` to `self.last_active`, which is of type `NoneType`. This suggests that `last_active` is not being initialized properly in the `__init__` method of the `Worker` class.

2. Error location:
The error is likely occurring in the line where `last_active` is assigned in the `__init__` method.

3. Cause of the bug:
The bug is caused by the default value of `None` for the `last_active` parameter in the `__init__` method. When `prune` method tries to add `config.worker_disconnect_delay` to `self.last_active`, it raises a `TypeError` because `None` cannot be added to an integer.

4. Strategy for fixing the bug:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that `last_active` is properly initialized to an appropriate value. This can be achieved by either assigning a default value that is an integer representing the seconds since epoch, or by setting the default value to `time.time()` directly in the `__init__` method.

5. Corrected version of the code:
```python
# The corrected version of the class containing the fixed function
class Worker(object):
    """
    Structure for tracking worker activity and keeping their references.
    """

    def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
        self.id = worker_id
        self.reference = None
        self.last_active = last_active if last_active is not None else time.time()
        self.started = time.time()
        self.tasks = set()
        self.info = {}
```

By making the correction shown above, the `last_active` parameter in the `__init__` method will now be initialized to `time.time()` if the incoming value is `None`, resolving the `TypeError` when trying to perform arithmetic operations using `None`.
