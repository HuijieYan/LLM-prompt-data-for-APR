1. The buggy function is the `__init__` constructor of the `Worker` class in the `luigi.scheduler` module. The error message indicates a `TypeError` when trying to add `NoneType` to an `int` in the `prune` method of the same class.

2. The potential error location is where `self.last_active` is being used in the `prune` method without checking if it is `None`, resulting in the `TypeError`. 

3. The cause of the bug is that the `last_active` parameter in the `__init__` method of the `Worker` class is set as `None` by default, but it is used directly in the `prune` method without handling the `None` case. This causes the `TypeError` when trying to perform arithmetic operations with `None`.

4. To fix the bug, we need to handle the case where `self.last_active` is `None` in the `prune` method before performing any arithmetic operations.

5. Here is the corrected version of the `Worker` class:

```python
class Worker(object):
    """
    Structure for tracking worker activity and keeping their references.
    """

    def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
        self.id = worker_id
        self.reference = None
        self.last_active = last_active
        self.started = time.time()
        self.tasks = set()
        self.info = {}
        
    def prune(self, config):
        # Delete workers that haven't said anything for a while (probably killed)
        if self.last_active is not None and self.last_active + config.worker_disconnect_delay < time.time():
            # Perform prune operation
            pass
```

In the corrected version, before trying to add `self.last_active` to the `config.worker_disconnect_delay`, we first check if `self.last_active` is not `None`. This check prevents the `TypeError` when operating on `None` and an integer.
