1. The buggy function is the `__init__` method of the `Worker` class in the `luigi.scheduler` module. The error message indicates that there is a TypeError when trying to add `NoneType` and `int` in the `prune` method of the Worker class.

2. The potential error is in the `__init__` method where the `last_active` parameter is set to `None`. This leads to the issue when trying to add `None` with an integer value in the `prune` method.

3. The cause of the bug is the initialization of the `last_active` parameter to `None` in the `Worker` class. Since `last_active` is being used in the `prune` method without any check for `None` value, it leads to a TypeError when trying to add `None` with an integer value.

4. To fix the bug, we should ensure that the `last_active` parameter is set to the current time in seconds since epoch if it is not provided during initialization. This will prevent any `None` values from causing issues in the `prune` method.

5. Here is the corrected version of the `__init__` method in the `Worker` class with the fix applied:

```python
class Worker(object):
    """
    Structure for tracking worker activity and keeping their references.
    """

    def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
        self.id = worker_id
        self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
        self.last_active = last_active if last_active is not None else time.time()  # seconds since epoch or current time
        self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        self.tasks = set()  # task objects
        self.info = {}
```

By checking if the `last_active` parameter is `None` and setting it to the current time if it is, we prevent the TypeError when using the parameter in the `prune` method.
