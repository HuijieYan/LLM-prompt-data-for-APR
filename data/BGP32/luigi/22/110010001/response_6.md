### Analyzing the buggy function and error message:
The `Worker` class contains an `__init__` method which initializes the instance of the class. The bug is occurring in the `prune` method of the `Worker` class, where it is trying to perform arithmetic operations involving `self.last_active`, which can be `None`, and an integer. This results in a `TypeError` since `None` is not a valid operand for addition.

### Potential error locations:
The error is occurring in the line where `self.last_active + config.worker_disconnect_delay` is performed. The issue lies in how `last_active` is initialized or handled in the `__init__` method of the `Worker` class.

### Cause of the bug:
The bug arises because the `last_active` attribute of the `Worker` class is being assigned `None` by default in its `__init__` method. When the `prune` method tries to add `config.worker_disconnect_delay` to this attribute, which results in `None + int`, causing the error.

### Strategy for fixing the bug:
To fix this bug, we need to handle the case where `last_active` can be `None` and ensure it is properly initialized or handled before performing any arithmetic operations. One approach is to provide a default value for `last_active` which will be used if none is provided.

### Corrected version of the `__init__` method:
Here is the corrected version of the `__init__` method that provides a default value for `last_active` attribute:
```python
def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
    self.id = worker_id
    self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
    self.last_active = last_active if last_active is not None else time.time()  # seconds since epoch if not provided
    self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
    self.tasks = set()  # task objects
    self.info = {}
```

This correction ensures that if `last_active` is not provided during initialization, it defaults to the current time (`time.time()`) to ensure it is an integer value.

By making this change, the arithmetic operation in the `prune` method will work correctly without raising a `TypeError`.
