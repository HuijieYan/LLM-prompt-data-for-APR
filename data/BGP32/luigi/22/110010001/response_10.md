### Analysis:
1. The buggy function is the `__init__` method of the `Worker` class in the `luigi.scheduler` module.
2. The error message occurs in the `prune` method of the `Worker` class, specifically when trying to add `self.last_active` (which can be None) with `config.worker_disconnect_delay` which is an integer.
3. The error message indicates a `TypeError` because Python does not support addition between `NoneType` and `int`.
4. To fix the bug, we need to ensure that `last_active` is either initialized to a valid value during object creation or handle the case when it is `None` in the `prune` method.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Initialize `last_active` to the current time if `None` during object creation to ensure it always has a valid value.
2. Update the `prune` method to handle the case when `last_active` is `None` before performing the addition operation.

### Corrected Version:
```python
import time

class Worker(object):
    """
    Structure for tracking worker activity and keeping their references.
    """

    def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
        self.id = worker_id
        self.reference = None  
        self.last_active = last_active if last_active is not None else time.time()
        self.started = time.time()
        self.tasks = set()
        self.info = {}

    def prune(self, config):
        if self.last_active is not None and self.last_active + config.worker_disconnect_delay < time.time():
            # perform pruning logic here
            pass
```

By initializing `last_active` to the current time if it is `None` during object creation and adding a check for `None` in the `prune` method, we can ensure that the corrected version handles the issue of unsupported operands between `NoneType` and `int`.
