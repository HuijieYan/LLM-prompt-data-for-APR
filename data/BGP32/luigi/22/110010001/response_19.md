1. The buggy function is the `__init__` method of the `Worker` class in the `luigi/scheduler.py` file. The error message is `TypeError: unsupported operand type(s) for +: 'NoneType' and 'int'` which indicates that the `last_active` attribute is being treated as a `NoneType` when trying to add `worker_disconnect_delay` to it.

2. The potential error location is the `self.last_active + config.worker_disconnect_delay` line in the `prune` method.

3. The cause of the bug is that `last_active` is being set to `None` if it is not provided when initializing a `Worker` object. This results in a `NoneType` error when trying to add `worker_disconnect_delay` to it. The error message highlights this issue where the `last_active` attribute is of the wrong type for arithmetic operations.

4. To fix this bug, we need to handle the case where `last_active` is `None` and convert it to a valid timestamp before performing any arithmetic operation on it.

5. Here is the corrected version of the `__init__` method of the `Worker` class:

```python
class Worker(object):
    """
    Structure for tracking worker activity and keeping their references.
    """

    def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
        self.id = worker_id
        self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
        self.last_active = last_active if last_active is not None else time.time()  # seconds since epoch or current time
        self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        self.tasks = set()  # task objects
        self.info = {}
```

By checking if `last_active` is `None` during initialization and assigning `time.time()` if it is, we prevent the `last_active` attribute from being `NoneType`. This will ensure that arithmetic operations involving `last_active` are valid and prevent the `TypeError` encountered in the failing test.
