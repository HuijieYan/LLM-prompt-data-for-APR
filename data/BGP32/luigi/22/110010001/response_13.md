1. The buggy function is the `__init__` method of the `Worker` class in the `luigi/scheduler.py` file. The error message indicates a `TypeError` occurring at line 245 of the `luigi/scheduler.py` file.

2. The potential error location in the buggy function is the line `self.last_active = last_active`. If the `last_active` argument is not provided when creating a `Worker` object, it defaults to `None`. This leads to a `NoneType` error when trying to add an integer to it.

3. The cause of the bug is that `last_active` is being initialized as `None` by default, causing an issue when performing arithmetic operations (addition) on it, as shown in the error message.

4. To fix the bug, we need to handle the case when `last_active` is not provided during the initialization of a `Worker` object. One way to handle this is by setting a default value for `last_active` inside the `__init__` method, such as the current time in seconds.

5. Here is the corrected version of the `__init__` method of the `Worker` class:

```python
class Worker(object):
    """
    Structure for tracking worker activity and keeping their references.
    """

    def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
        self.id = worker_id
        self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
        self.last_active = last_active if last_active is not None else time.time()  # seconds since epoch or current time
        self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        self.tasks = set()  # task objects
        self.info = {}
```

By initializing `last_active` with `time.time()` if it is not provided, we ensure that it always has a valid numeric value, preventing the `TypeError` when performing calculations involving it later on.
