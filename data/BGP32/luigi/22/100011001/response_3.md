### Bug Analysis
The error message indicates a `TypeError` due to trying to add a `NoneType` and an `int` in the line `if self.last_active + config.worker_disconnect_delay < time.time():`. The `last_active` attribute is initialized as `None` when not provided explicitly in the `__init__` method, causing this issue.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix this bug, we need to make sure that `last_active` is assigned a valid timestamp if it is not provided explicitly during the object initialization.

### Corrected Version
```python
def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
    self.id = worker_id
    self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
    self.last_active = last_active if last_active is not None else time.time()  # seconds since epoch if not provided
    self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
    self.tasks = set()  # task objects
    self.info = {}
```
