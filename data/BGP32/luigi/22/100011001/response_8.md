The issue in the buggy function is with the `last_active` parameter being set to `None` initially, causing a `TypeError` when trying to perform an addition operation with an `int` value in the `prune` method. To fix this bug, we need to handle the case where `last_active` is `None` before performing the addition operation.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
import time

def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
    self.id = worker_id
    self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
    self.last_active = last_active if last_active is not None else time.time()  # seconds since epoch if last_active is None
    self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
    self.tasks = set()  # task objects
    self.info = {}
```

By checking if `last_active` is `None` before setting its value, we ensure that it defaults to the current time if no value is provided. This change will prevent the `TypeError` when trying to add an integer value to `None`.

After making this correction, the failing test `test_worker_prune_after_init` should pass successfully.
