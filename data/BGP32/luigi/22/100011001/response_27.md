### Analysis
The error message indicates a `TypeError: unsupported operand type(s) for +: 'NoneType' and 'int'`, specifically in the line `if self.last_active + config.worker_disconnect_delay < time.time():`. This error occurs because `self.last_active` is initialized as `None` in the buggy function, and when trying to add an integer (`config.worker_disconnect_delay`) to `None`, it raises a `TypeError`.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix this bug, we need to ensure that `self.last_active` is initialized as the current time in seconds since epoch if no `last_active` parameter is provided during the initialization of the `Worker` object. This way, we can avoid the `NoneType` mismatch with the integer value when comparing it with `config.worker_disconnect_delay`.

### Corrected Version
```python
def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
    self.id = worker_id
    self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
    self.last_active = last_active if last_active is not None else time.time()  # seconds since epoch
    self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
    self.tasks = set()  # task objects
    self.info = {}
```
