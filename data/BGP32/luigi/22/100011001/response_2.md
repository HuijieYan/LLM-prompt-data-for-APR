### Analyzing the Bug
The error message indicates a `TypeError` at line 245 of the `luigi/scheduler.py` file, specifically in the `prune()` method. The issue arises when attempting to add `self.last_active` (which is initially `None`) with an integer (`config.worker_disconnect_delay`) using the `+` operator.

### Bug Explanation
- In the `__init__` method of the `Worker` class, the `last_active` parameter is initialized as `None`, causing the `self.last_active` attribute to have a `NoneType`.
- When the `prune()` method is called and tries to compare `self.last_active + config.worker_disconnect_delay` with the current time (`time.time()`), the operation fails due to the unsupported operand types (`NoneType` and `int`).

### Bug Fix Strategy
- Ensure that `self.last_active` is properly initialized to a numerical value when not provided during the `Worker` object creation.
- Update the comparison in the `prune()` method to handle the scenario where `self.last_active` is `None`.

### Corrected Version
```python
class Worker:
    def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
        self.id = worker_id
        self.reference = None
        self.last_active = last_active if last_active is not None else time.time()  # Initialize last_active if not provided
        self.started = time.time()
        self.tasks = set()
        self.info = {}

    def prune(self, config):
        if self.last_active is not None and self.last_active + config.worker_disconnect_delay < time.time():
            # Perform pruning actions
            pass

# Test should now pass with the corrected version
``` 

With these changes, the `Worker` class now initializes `self.last_active` to the current time if no value is provided, preventing the `NoneType` issue in the `prune()` method. The updated comparison also checks if `self.last_active` is not `None` before performing the arithmetic operation.
