### Analysis
The error message indicates a `TypeError` due to trying to perform addition between a `NoneType` and an `int`. The error occurs when the `prune` method is called and the `last_active` attribute is `None`. 

### Bug Cause
The bug is caused by not providing a default value for `last_active` in the `__init__` method. When `last_active` is not provided, it defaults to `None`, causing the error when trying to perform addition in the `prune` method.

### Fix
To fix the bug, we need to assign a default value to `last_active` during initialization, such as the current time if no `last_active` value is supplied.

### Corrected Version
```python
# The corrected version of the function
def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
    self.id = worker_id
    self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
    if last_active is None:
        self.last_active = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
    else:
        self.last_active = last_active
    self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
    self.tasks = set()  # task objects
    self.info = {}
``` 

By providing a default value for `last_active` based on the current time if none is provided, we prevent the `NoneType` error when performing arithmetic operations in the `prune` method.
