### Explanation:
The error occurs because the `last_active` parameter in the `__init__` function is set to `None` by default, and then when trying to calculate `self.last_active + config.worker_disconnect_delay`, the `NoneType` cannot be added to an integer value.

### Fix:
To fix the bug, we need to provide a default value for `last_active` that is compatible with the addition operation. One way to do this is to set `last_active` to `time.time()` if no value is provided.

### Corrected version of the function:
```python
def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
    self.id = worker_id
    self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
    self.last_active = last_active if last_active is not None else time.time()  # seconds since epoch or current time
    self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
    self.tasks = set()  # task objects
    self.info = {}
```
