The issue in the buggy function is that the `last_active` parameter can be `None`, causing a `TypeError` when trying to add an `int` value to it in the `prune` method.

To fix this issue, we need to handle the case where `last_active` is `None` and set it to a default value before performing the addition in the `prune` method. One common approach is to set it to a default value if `last_active` is `None` using a conditional statement.

Here is the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
    self.id = worker_id
    self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
    self.last_active = last_active if last_active is not None else time.time()  # seconds since epoch or current time
    self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
    self.tasks = set()  # task objects
    self.info = {}
```

This update ensures that if `last_active` is `None`, it will default to the current time using `time.time()`.

With this correction, the `prune` method will be able to perform the addition operation without encountering a `TypeError` due to `NoneType`.
