### Explanation
The error message `TypeError: unsupported operand type(s) for +: 'NoneType' and 'int'` indicates that the variable `self.last_active` is `None`, which is causing the addition operation in the `prune` method to fail.

### Bug Analysis
In the `__init__` method of the `Worker` class, the `last_active` parameter has a default value of `None`. This default value is retained when no value is provided during the instantiation of a `Worker` object. Therefore, when the `prune` method tries to calculate `(self.last_active + config.worker_disconnect_delay)`, it encounters a `NoneType` which cannot be added to an `int`.

### Proposed Fix
To fix the issue, we can set a default value for `last_active` to be the current timestamp using `time.time()` if no value is provided during the instantiation of a `Worker` object.

### Corrected Version
```python
def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
    self.id = worker_id
    self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
    
    if last_active is None:
        self.last_active = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
    else:
        self.last_active = last_active
        
    self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
    self.tasks = set()  # task objects
    self.info = {}
``` 

By making this change, the `last_active` attribute will default to the current timestamp if no value is provided, ensuring that the arithmetic operation in the `prune` method will work correctly.
