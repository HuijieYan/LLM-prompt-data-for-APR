### Bug Analysis
The error message indicates a `TypeError` when trying to add an integer value to `NoneType`. This occurs in the `prune` method when attempting to calculate `self.last_active + config.worker_disconnect_delay`.

Looking at the initial values of `last_active` provided during initialization, the default value is `None`. When trying to perform addition with an integer value (`config.worker_disconnect_delay`), the operation fails due to the `None` type.

### Bug Fix
To fix this issue, we need to introduce a default value for `last_active` in the `__init__` method. This default value would allow for smooth addition operations in the `prune` method.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
import time

def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
    self.id = worker_id
    self.reference = None
    self.last_active = last_active if last_active is not None else time.time()  # Setting a default value here
    self.started = time.time()
    self.tasks = set()
    self.info = {}
```

With this modification, the `last_active` value will default to the current time (seconds since epoch) if not explicitly provided during initialization, resolving the `TypeError` issue in the `prune` method.
