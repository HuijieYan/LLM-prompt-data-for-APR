### Bug Analysis
The error message indicates a `TypeError` when trying to add `NoneType` and `int` while executing the `prune()` method of the `Worker` class. This error occurs due to the `last_active` attribute being initialized as `None` in the `__init__()` method and used in the `prune()` method without appropriate handling.

### Bug Fix Strategy
1. Update the initialization of `last_active` in the `__init__` method to a default value to avoid `NoneType` errors.
2. Update the `prune()` method to handle the case where `last_active` is `None`.

### Corrected Version
```python
# The corrected version of the buggy function
def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
    self.id = worker_id
    self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
    self.last_active = last_active if last_active is not None else time.time()  # seconds since epoch if not provided
    self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
    self.tasks = set()  # task objects
    self.info = {}

def prune(self, config):
    # Delete workers that haven't said anything for a while (probably killed)
    if self.last_active is not None and self.last_active + config.worker_disconnect_delay < time.time():
        # Pruning logic here
        pass
```

By initializing `last_active` with the current time if not provided during initialization and adding a check in the `prune()` method to handle the case where `last_active` is `None`, the corrected version prevents the `TypeError` that occurred in the buggy code.
