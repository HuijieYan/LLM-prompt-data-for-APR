The issue in the buggy function arises because the `last_active` parameter is initialized as `None`, and an attempt is made to add an integer value to `None` in the `prune` method. This results in a `TypeError`.

To fix this issue, you can initialize `self.last_active` to a default value if `last_active` is not provided during initialization. One approach could be setting `self.last_active` to `time.time()` if `last_active` is `None`. This way, the `last_active` parameter will always have a valid value and prevent the `TypeError`.

Here is the corrected version of the function:
```python
def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
    self.id = worker_id
    self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
    self.last_active = last_active if last_active is not None else time.time()  # seconds since epoch
    self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
    self.tasks = set()  # task objects
    self.info = {}
```

This modification ensures that `self.last_active` is always a valid timestamp, either provided by the input `last_active` parameter or the current timestamp using `time.time()`.
