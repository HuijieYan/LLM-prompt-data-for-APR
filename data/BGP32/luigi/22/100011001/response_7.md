The error message indicates a `TypeError` caused by trying to add an integer to a `NoneType` object in the `prune` method.

The issue lies in the `__init__` method where the `last_active` parameter is set to `None` by default. Later, in the `prune` method, when trying to calculate `self.last_active + config.worker_disconnect_delay`, it results in the error because `None` cannot be added to an integer.

To fix this bug, we need to handle the case where `last_active` is `None` in the `prune` method. One approach is to set a default value to `last_active` if it is `None` in the `__init__` method.

Here is the corrected version of the `__init__` method:

```python
def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
    self.id = worker_id
    self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
    self.last_active = last_active if last_active is not None else time.time()  # seconds since epoch or set to current time if None
    self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
    self.tasks = set()  # task objects
    self.info = {}
```

With this modification, if `last_active` is not provided during initialization, it will default to the current time. This adjustment ensures that there won't be any `None` values causing errors when performing calculations in the `prune` method.
