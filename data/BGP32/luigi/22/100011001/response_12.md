The bug in the provided code is due to the `last_active` parameter being set to `None` initially, resulting in a `NoneType` error when attempting to perform arithmetic operations with it.

### Cause of the bug:
- The `last_active` parameter is initialized as `None` in the constructor.
- In the `prune()` method, when trying to calculate `self.last_active + config.worker_disconnect_delay`, an error occurs since you can't add an integer to `None`.

### Fix strategy:
Initialize `last_active` with the current time when it is not provided as a parameter during object creation.

### Corrected version of the function:
```python
def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
    self.id = worker_id
    self.reference = None  
    self.last_active = last_active if last_active is not None else time.time()  
    self.started = time.time()  
    self.tasks = set()  
    self.info = {}
```

By setting `last_active` to the current time if it's not provided, we ensure that it always holds a valid numerical value, preventing the `NoneType` error in the `prune()` method.
