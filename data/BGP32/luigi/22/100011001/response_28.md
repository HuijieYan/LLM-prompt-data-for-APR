### Bug Analysis
The error message `TypeError: unsupported operand type(s) for +: 'NoneType' and 'int'` indicates that the addition operation is being performed between a `NoneType` and an `int`, specifically in the line `if self.last_active + config.worker_disconnect_delay < time.time():`.

Looking at the runtime values, we can see that `self.last_active` is initialized with a default value of `None`. As a result, when the `prune` method is called and `self.last_active` is `None`, the addition operation with an `int` value (`config.worker_disconnect_delay`) triggers the error.

### Fix Strategy
To fix this bug, we need to handle the case where `self.last_active` is `None` before performing the addition operation. One possible approach is to check if `self.last_active` is `None`, and if so, set it to the current time. This way, we ensure that `self.last_active` always contains a valid numeric value for comparison.

### Corrected Version
```python
def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
    self.id = worker_id
    self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
    self.last_active = last_active if last_active is not None else time.time()  # seconds since epoch
    self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
    self.tasks = set()  # task objects
    self.info = {}

def prune(self, config):
    # Set last_active to current time if it is None
    if self.last_active is None:
        self.last_active = time.time()
    
    # Delete workers that haven't said anything for a while (probably killed)
    if self.last_active + config.worker_disconnect_delay < time.time():
        # Perform pruning logic here
        pass
``` 

By making the initialization of `self.last_active` conditional on its value being `None`, we ensure that it always contains a valid numeric value, preventing the `TypeError` during the addition operation.
