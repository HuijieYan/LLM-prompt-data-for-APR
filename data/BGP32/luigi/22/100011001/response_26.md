The issue in the buggy function lies in the initialization of `self.last_active`, which is set to `None`. This causes a` TypeError` when trying to add an integer value to `None` in the `prune` method.

To fix this issue, we need to handle the case where `last_active` is `None` by setting a default value for it. We can use the current time as the default value if `last_active` is not provided during initialization.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
    self.id = worker_id
    self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
    if last_active is not None:
        self.last_active = last_active  # seconds since epoch
    else:
        self.last_active = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
    self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
    self.tasks = set()  # task objects
    self.info = {}
```

This modification ensures that `self.last_active` is always initialized either with the provided `last_active` value or with the current time if `last_active` is `None`. This will prevent the `TypeError` when trying to add an integer to `None` in the `prune` method.
