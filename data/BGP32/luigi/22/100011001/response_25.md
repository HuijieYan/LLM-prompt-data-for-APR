### Bug Explanation
The error message `TypeError: unsupported operand type(s) for +: 'NoneType' and 'int'` indicates that there is an issue with trying to add a `NoneType` value to an integer in the expression `self.last_active + config.worker_disconnect_delay`. This error occurs because the `last_active` attribute of the `Worker` object is initialized as `None`, and when trying to add the `worker_disconnect_delay` value to `None`, it causes a type mismatch error.

### Bug Fix
To fix this bug, we need to handle the case where `last_active` is `None` by providing a default value. One common approach is to assign a default value to `last_active` if it is not provided during initialization.

### Corrected Version
```python
def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
    self.id = worker_id
    self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
    self.last_active = last_active if last_active is not None else time.time()
    self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
    self.tasks = set()  # task objects
    self.info = {}
```

By assigning the current time using `time.time()` as the default value for `last_active` if it is not provided, we ensure that `last_active` is always initialized with a valid timestamp, preventing the `NoneType` error when performing arithmetic operations. This correction should resolve the bug and allow the failing test to pass successfully.
