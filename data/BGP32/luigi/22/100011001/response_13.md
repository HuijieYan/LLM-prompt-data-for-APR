The bug in the provided function is due to the `last_active` parameter being set as `None`. When trying to add an integer value (`config.worker_disconnect_delay`) to `None` in the `prune` method, a `TypeError` is raised.

### Bug Cause:
- The `last_active` parameter is initialized as `None`, which leads to the error when trying to compare it with an integer value in the `prune` method.

### Fix Strategy:
- Check if `last_active` is `None`, and if so, handle it appropriately to avoid the `TypeError`.

### Corrected Version:

```python
def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
    self.id = worker_id
    self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
    self.last_active = last_active if last_active is not None else time.time()  # seconds since epoch or current time
    self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
    self.tasks = set()  # task objects
    self.info = {}

def prune(self, config):
    # Delete workers that haven't said anything for a while (probably killed)
    if self.last_active + config.worker_disconnect_delay < time.time():
        # prune the worker
        pass
```

With this correction, the `last_active` parameter will default to the current time if it is `None`, preventing the `TypeError` when comparing it with an integer value in the `prune` method.
