### Bug Analysis
The error message indicates a `TypeError` in the `prune` method related to an unsupported operand type(s) for addition between a `NoneType` and an `int`. This suggests that `self.last_active` may be `None` at some point during the execution of the code.

### Bug Explanation
In the `__init__` method, the `self.last_active` parameter is set to `None` by default. Later in the `prune` method, the code tries to add `config.worker_disconnect_delay` (which is an `int`) to `self.last_active`. However, if `self.last_active` is `None`, the addition operation will raise a `TypeError`.

### Bug Fix
To fix the bug, you can verify if `self.last_active` is `None` before attempting to calculate the pruning condition. If it's `None`, you can handle it accordingly. One approach is to set a default value when `last_active` is not provided.

### Corrected Version
```python
def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
    self.id = worker_id
    self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world (Currently a dict containing just the host)
    self.last_active = last_active if last_active is not None else time.time()  # seconds since epoch or current time
    self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
    self.tasks = set()  # task objects
    self.info = {}
``` 

In the corrected version, if `last_active` is `None`, the current time is used instead as a default value to avoid the `NoneType` issue during pruning calculations.
