### Explanation
The error message indicates a `TypeError` when trying to add `NoneType` and `int`. This error occurs because the `last_active` parameter is initialized as `None`, and when trying to perform the comparison `self.last_active + config.worker_disconnect_delay`, it leads to adding `None + int`, resulting in a `TypeError`.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix this bug, we need to handle the case where `last_active` is `None` before performing the comparison. One common approach is to set a default value for `last_active` if it is `None`. We can set it to `0` (epoch time) or the current time depending on the desired behavior.

### Corrected Version
```python
def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
    self.id = worker_id
    self.reference = None
    self.last_active = last_active if last_active is not None else 0
    self.started = time.time()
    self.tasks = set()
    self.info = {}

def prune(self, config):
    if self.last_active + config.worker_disconnect_delay < time.time():
        # Perform pruning operation here based on the condition
```
