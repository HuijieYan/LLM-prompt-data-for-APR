The issue in the code is due to the `last_active` parameter being initialized as `None` in the `__init__` method of the `Worker` class. When trying to calculate `self.last_active + config.worker_disconnect_delay` in the `prune` method, Python raises a `TypeError` because you cannot perform arithmetic operations with a `NoneType` and an `int`.

To fix this issue, you can set default values for the `last_active` parameter in the `__init__` method. If no value is provided, set it to the current time using `time.time()`.

Here is the corrected version of the `__init__` method in the `Worker` class:

```python
def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
    self.id = worker_id
    self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world (currently a dict containing just the host)
    self.last_active = last_active if last_active is not None else time.time()  # seconds since epoch
    self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
    self.tasks = set()  # task objects
    self.info = {}
```

By initializing `last_active` with the current time if no value is provided, you ensure that it is always a valid value for arithmetic operations.

After making this change, the `prune` method should work correctly without raising the `TypeError` when trying to compare `self.last_active` with the current time.
