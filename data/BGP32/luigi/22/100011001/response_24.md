### Analyzing the buggy function and error message
The error message indicates a `TypeError` when trying to perform addition between a `NoneType` and an `int`. This error occurs in the `prune()` method when checking if `self.last_active + config.worker_disconnect_delay < time.time()`. The `NoneType` value is due to the `last_active` parameter being initialized as `None` in the `__init__` method of the `Worker` class.

### Bug cause
The `last_active` attribute of the `Worker` class is initialized as `None`, and when trying to add `config.worker_disconnect_delay` to it, it results in a `TypeError` because you cannot add an `int` to `None`.

### Fix strategy
To fix the bug, initialize `last_active` with the current time if it is not provided during object creation. This way, the attribute will always have a valid timestamp for comparison.

### Corrected version of the buggy function
```python
def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
    self.id = worker_id
    self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
    self.last_active = last_active if last_active is not None else time.time()  # seconds since epoch or current time
    self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
    self.tasks = set()  # task objects
    self.info = {}
```
