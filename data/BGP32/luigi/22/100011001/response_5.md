### Bug Analysis
The error message `TypeError: unsupported operand type(s) for +: 'NoneType' and 'int'` indicates that the variable `self.last_active` is `None` when the `prune()` method is called. This causes an issue when trying to add `config.worker_disconnect_delay` to it.

### Bug Explanation
The variable `self.last_active` is initialized to `None` in the `__init__` method. When the `prune()` method is called, if `self.last_active` remains `None`, an error occurs when trying to add an integer value to `None`.

### Bug Fix
To fix this issue, we need to ensure that `self.last_active` is properly initialized to a default value when `last_active` is not provided during object creation. One way to do this is to check if `last_active` is `None` in the `__init__` method and assign a default value to `self.last_active` if needed.

### Corrected Version
```python
def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
    self.id = worker_id
    self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
    self.last_active = last_active if last_active is not None else time.time()  # seconds since epoch if not provided
    self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
    self.tasks = set()  # task objects
    self.info = {}
``` 

By checking if `last_active` is `None` and assigning `time.time()` if it is, we ensure that `self.last_active` always has a valid value before using it in the `prune()` method.
