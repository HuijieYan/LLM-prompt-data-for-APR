### Bug Analysis
The error is occurring when trying to add `self.last_active` (which is initially set to `None`) to a value of `config.worker_disconnect_delay` and comparing it with `time.time()`.

### Bug Explanation
The error message `TypeError: unsupported operand type(s) for +: 'NoneType' and 'int'` indicates that the addition operation between a `NoneType` and an `int` is not supported, which is happening when trying to add `self.last_active` (which is `None`) to an integer value (`config.worker_disconnect_delay`).

### Bug Fix
We need to handle the case when `self.last_active` is `None` by checking if it is set before performing the addition operation.

### Corrected Version
```python
def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
    self.id = worker_id
    self.reference = None
    self.last_active = last_active
    self.started = time.time()
    self.tasks = set()
    self.info = {}

def prune(self, config):
    if self.last_active is not None and self.last_active + config.worker_disconnect_delay < time.time():
        # Perform pruning operation here
```
