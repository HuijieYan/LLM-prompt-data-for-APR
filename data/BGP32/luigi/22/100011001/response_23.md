### Bug Analysis
The error message indicates a `TypeError` caused by trying to add `NoneType` with an `int` in the line `if self.last_active + config.worker_disconnect_delay < time.time():`. The runtime values show that `self.last_active` is initialized as `None`, causing the error.

### Bug Cause
The `last_active` parameter defaults to `None` in the `__init__` function, and since no value is assigned to it while creating a `Worker` object in the test, it remains as `None`. This leads to the error when trying to perform addition with `None` and an `int`.

### Fix Strategy
To fix this bug, ensure that if `last_active` is not provided during `Worker` object creation, it should be initialized to the current time in seconds instead of `None`. This will ensure that the subsequent comparison in the `prune` function works correctly.

### Corrected Version
```python
def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
    self.id = worker_id
    self.reference = None
    self.last_active = last_active if last_active is not None else time.time()
    self.started = time.time()
    self.tasks = set()
    self.info = {}
``` 

By making this change, the `last_active` will default to the current time if no value is provided, preventing the `TypeError` when comparing it with other time values.
