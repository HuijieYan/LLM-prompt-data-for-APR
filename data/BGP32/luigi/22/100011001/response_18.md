### Analyzing the buggy function
The `__init__` function of the Worker class is designed to initialize worker objects with specific attributes like `id`, `last_active`, `started`, `tasks`, and `info`. The bug is caused by the `last_active` attribute being initialized with a default value of `None` and then subsequently used in a calculation without checking if it's `None`. This leads to a `TypeError` when trying to add an integer to `None`.

### Bug cause
The bug occurs because when the `last_active` attribute is not provided during object initialization, it defaults to `None`. Then, when the `prune` method is called and tries to add an integer (config.worker_disconnect_delay) to `None`, it raises a `TypeError`.

### Fix strategy
To fix the bug, we need to check if `self.last_active` is not `None` before performing any calculations with it in the `prune` method. If it's `None`, we can choose to either set it to the current time or handle it differently based on the desired behavior.

### Corrected version of the function
```python
def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
    self.id = worker_id
    self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
    self.last_active = last_active if last_active is not None else time.time()  # seconds since epoch or set to current time
    self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
    self.tasks = set()  # task objects
    self.info = {}
    
def prune(self, config):
    if self.last_active is not None and self.last_active + config.worker_disconnect_delay < time.time():
        # perform pruning operation here
        pass
```

By incorporating the check for `None` in the initialization of `last_active`, we ensure that it is correctly initialized with either the provided value or the current time. This way, the calculation in the `prune` method will proceed without raising a `TypeError`.
