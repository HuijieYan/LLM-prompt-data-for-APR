## Analysis:
1. The buggy function `__init__` within the `Worker` class in `luigi/scheduler.py` is missing the `self` parameter in its definition.
2. The error message indicates that the `last_active` attribute is potentially `None`, leading to a `TypeError` when trying to add `config.worker_disconnect_delay` to it.
3. The bug occurs because the `last_active` attribute is set as `None` by default, and when trying to perform arithmetic operations with `None`, it raises a `TypeError`.
4. To fix this bug, we should initialize `last_active` to a default value if it's not provided during object creation.

## Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
1. Initialize the `last_active` attribute to `0` if no value is provided during object creation to avoid `NoneType` errors when calculating time differences.
2. Ensure that the `Worker` class has the `self` parameter in its `__init__` method to correctly initialize the object's attributes.

## Corrected Version of the Buggy Function:

```python
# The corrected version of the buggy function
def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
    self.id = worker_id
    self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
    self.last_active = last_active if last_active is not None else 0  # seconds since epoch, set to 0 if None
    self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
    self.tasks = set()  # task objects
    self.info = {}
```

By making the above correction, the `Worker` object will be properly initialized with a default value of `0` for `last_active` if no value is provided, preventing the `TypeError` encountered in the failing test scenario.
