## Analysis:
1. The `__init__` function of the `Worker` class in the buggy code initializes the `self.last_active` variable with a default value of `None`.
2. The `prune` method in the failing test code tries to access `self.last_active` and perform addition with `config.worker_disconnect_delay`.
3. The error message indicates a `TypeError` due to trying to add `NoneType` and an integer.

## Bug Cause:
The bug is caused because `self.last_active` is being initialized as `None` in the `__init__` function. This causes an error when `prune` method tries to add an integer to `None`.

## Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, you should handle the case where `last_active` is `None` in the `prune` method by providing a default value or validating the input.

## Corrected Version:
```python
def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
    self.id = worker_id
    self.reference = None
    self.last_active = last_active if last_active is not None else time.time()  # Check if last_active is provided, else default to current time
    self.started = time.time()
    self.tasks = set()
    self.info = {}

def prune(self, config):
    if self.last_active is not None and self.last_active + config.worker_disconnect_delay < time.time():  # Check if last_active is not None before adding
        # Perform prune operation
```
