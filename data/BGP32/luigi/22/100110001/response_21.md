### Analysis:
1. The `__init__` function of the `Worker` class in the `luigi.scheduler` module is missing the required parameter `self`.
2. The `last_active` parameter is assigned a default value of `None`, which causes the bug when trying to perform addition operations on it.
3. The failing test `test_worker_prune_after_init` tries to call the `prune` method on a `Worker` instance with a configuration object that includes a `worker_disconnect_delay` attribute.
4. The bug occurs when the `prune` method attempts to compare `self.last_active` (which is `None` by default) with an integer, resulting in a `TypeError`.

### Fix Strategy:
1. Update the `__init__` function to include the `self` parameter.
2. Change the default value for `last_active` to `time.time()` to ensure it is initialized with a valid timestamp.

### Corrected Version:
```python
# The corrected version of the buggy function
def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
    self.id = worker_id
    self.reference = None
    self.last_active = last_active if last_active is not None else time.time()
    self.started = time.time()
    self.tasks = set()
    self.info = {}

def prune(self, config):
    if self.last_active + config.worker_disconnect_delay < time.time():
        # Perform pruning logic here
        pass
```

By making these changes, the `Worker` class's `__init__` function will properly initialize the `last_active` attribute, allowing the `prune` method to execute without causing a `TypeError`.
