The issue in the provided code is that the `last_active` parameter in the `__init__` method of the `Worker` class is set to `None` when no value is provided. This causes a `TypeError` when trying to add `config.worker_disconnect_delay` to `self.last_active` in the `prune` method.

1. The failing test `test_worker_prune_after_init` creates a `Worker` object with an `id` of `123` and then calls the `prune` method on it with a custom configuration object `TmpCfg`.
2. The failing line in the test triggers the `prune` method in the `Worker` class which tries to add `config.worker_disconnect_delay` to `self.last_active`.
3. The error message shows that the addition operation in `prune` method fails due to the `NoneType` value of `self.last_active` when trying to add an integer value (`config.worker_disconnect_delay`) to it.
4. To fix this bug, we need to set a default value for `last_active` in the `__init__` method of the `Worker` class if no value is provided, like `0` or the current time. This will ensure that the addition operation in the `prune` method works correctly.

Here is the corrected version of the `__init__` method in the `Worker` class:

```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: luigi/scheduler.py

# The corrected __init__ method
def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
    self.id = worker_id
    self.reference = None
    self.last_active = last_active if last_active is not None else time.time()  # Setting a default value
    self.started = time.time()
    self.tasks = set()
    self.info = {}
```

By setting a default value for `last_active` in the `__init__` method, the `prune` method will no longer raise a `TypeError` and the corrected version should pass the failing test successfully.
