The bug in the code arises from the fact that the `last_active` attribute of the `Worker` class is initialized with a default value of `None` which causes a `TypeError` when it is used in the `prune` method to perform addition with an integer value.

To fix this bug, we need to ensure that `last_active` is always assigned a valid integer value. One possible strategy is to check if `last_active` is `None` when initializing the `Worker` object and set it to the current time if it is `None`.

Here is the corrected version of the `__init__` function:

```python
def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
    self.id = worker_id
    self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
    
    if last_active is None:
        last_active = time.time()  # Set last_active to current time if not provided
    self.last_active = last_active  # seconds since epoch
    
    self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
    self.tasks = set()  # task objects
    self.info = {}
```

By initializing `last_active` with the current time if it is `None`, we ensure that it always holds a valid integer value. This will prevent the `TypeError` when trying to add an integer to `None`.

With this correction in place, the `Worker` object will now be able to properly prune based on the time comparison in the `prune` method and the failing test will pass successfully.
