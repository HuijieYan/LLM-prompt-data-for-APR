The bug in the provided function `__init__` is that it accepts `last_active` as an optional parameter with a default value of `None`, but it is expected to be compared with an integer later in the `prune` method. The error message indicates that there is a `TypeError` occurring due to an unsupported operand type for `+` between `NoneType` and `int`.

To fix this bug, we need to ensure that `last_active` is initialized to an integer timestamp in the `__init__` method if it is not provided during object creation.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
import time

def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
    self.id = worker_id
    self.reference = None
    if last_active is not None:
        self.last_active = last_active
    else:
        self.last_active = time.time()
    self.started = time.time()
    self.tasks = set()
    self.info = {}
```

By initializing `self.last_active` to `time.time()` if `last_active` is `None`, we ensure that it will always be an integer timestamp and prevent the `TypeError` that was occurring before. This correction ensures that the function works as expected and passes the failing test.
