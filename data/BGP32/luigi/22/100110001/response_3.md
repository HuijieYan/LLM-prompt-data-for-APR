## Analysis:
1. The error occurs when trying to add `self.last_active` (which could be `None`) with an integer value in the line `if self.last_active + config.worker_disconnect_delay < time.time():`.
2. The `__init__` of the `Worker` class initializes `self.last_active` as `None`, causing the TypeError during the `prune` method.

## Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Update the `__init__` method of the `Worker` class to set `self.last_active` to the current time if `last_active` is not provided.
2. This change ensures that `self.last_active` is never `None`, avoiding the TypeError.

## Corrected Buggy Function:
```python
def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
    self.id = worker_id
    self.reference = None
    if last_active is not None:
        self.last_active = last_active
    else:
        self.last_active = time.time()
    self.started = time.time()
    self.tasks = set()
    self.info = {}
```

By making this adjustment in the initialization of the `Worker` class, the corrected version ensures that `self.last_active` is always assigned a valid time value.
