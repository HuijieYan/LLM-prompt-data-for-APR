### Analysis:
The error message indicates a `TypeError` due to unsupported operand types during addition, specifically between a `NoneType` and an `int`. This points to an issue with the `last_active` variable being assigned as `None` initially, which causes the error when trying to add it to `config.worker_disconnect_delay`.

### Bug Location:
The bug is located in the `__init__` function of the `Worker` class in the `luigi.scheduler.py` file where `last_active` is initialized as `None`.

### Cause of the Bug:
The bug occurs because the `last_active` variable is not properly initialized or set to the current time of the worker's last activity. When the `prune` method is called with a configuration that includes a delay value, it tries to add `None` (initial value of `last_active`) to an integer value, resulting in a `TypeError`.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that `last_active` is initialized with the correct timestamp (seconds since epoch) either by passing it as an argument or setting it to the current time at the time of worker initialization.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
    self.id = worker_id
    self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
    self.last_active = last_active if last_active is not None else time.time()  # seconds since epoch
    self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
    self.tasks = set()  # task objects
    self.info = {}

def prune(self, config):
    # Delete workers that haven't said anything for a while (probably killed)
    if self.last_active + config.worker_disconnect_delay < time.time():
        # Perform prune operation
        pass
```

### Summary:
By initializing `last_active` with the current time if it is not provided explicitly, the error of adding `None` to an integer is avoided in the corrected version of the code. This correction ensures that the `prune` method can correctly calculate the time difference between the worker's last activity and the current time for pruning operations.
