The bug in the provided `__init__` function of the `Worker` class is due to the `last_active` parameter being passed as `None`, which causes a `TypeError` when added to an integer in the `prune` method. To fix this, we should handle the case when `last_active` is `None` and set it to the current time in that scenario.

Here is the corrected version of the `__init__` function:

```python
def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
    self.id = worker_id
    self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
    
    if last_active is None:
        self.last_active = time.time()
    else:
        self.last_active = last_active
        
    self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
    self.tasks = set()  # task objects
    self.info = {}
```

By checking if `last_active` is `None` and setting it to the current time if it is, we ensure that the `last_active` attribute is always a valid time value. This correction will prevent the `TypeError` that occurred during the test execution.
