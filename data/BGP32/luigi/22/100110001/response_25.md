The issue in the buggy code lies in the `__init__` method of the `Worker` class. The `last_active` parameter is allowed to be `None`, which causes a `TypeError` when trying to add the `config.worker_disconnect_delay` to it in the `prune` method.

To fix this bug, we need to ensure that `last_active` is always initialized to a default value (such as 0) if it is not provided.

Here is the corrected version of the `__init__` method:

```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: luigi/scheduler.py

def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
    self.id = worker_id
    self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world (Currently a dict containing just the host)
    if last_active is None:
        self.last_active = 0
    else:
        self.last_active = last_active
    self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
    self.tasks = set()  # task objects
    self.info = {}
```

With this correction, the `last_active` attribute will default to 0 if not provided during the initialization of the `Worker` object. This change ensures that the addition operation in the `prune` method does not result in a `TypeError`, and the corrected function will pass the failing test case.
