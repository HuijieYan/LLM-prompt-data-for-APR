## Analysis:
1. The buggy function is the `__init__` method of the `Worker` class in the `luigi.scheduler` module.
2. The failing test is trying to create a worker instance and then calling the `prune` method on that worker instance.
3. The error message indicates a `TypeError` occurring in the `prune` method of the `Worker` class at line 245 of `luigi/scheduler.py`, specifically due to adding an integer value to a `NoneType`.
4. The cause of the bug is that the `last_active` attribute of the worker is initialized as `None`, and when the `prune` method tries to calculate the time difference, it tries to add an integer to `None`, resulting in a `TypeError`.

## Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that `last_active` is properly initialized with a valid timestamp when the worker is created. One approach is to modify the `__init__` method to initialize `last_active` with the current time if it is not provided during worker creation.

## Corrected Version of the buggy function:
```python
def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
    self.id = worker_id
    self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
    self.last_active = last_active if last_active is not None else time.time()  # seconds since epoch
    self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
    self.tasks = set()  # task objects
    self.info = {}
```

By initializing `last_active` with the current time if it is not provided explicitly, we ensure that there won't be a `NoneType` mismatch when performing calculations in the `prune` method or any other method that uses `last_active`.
