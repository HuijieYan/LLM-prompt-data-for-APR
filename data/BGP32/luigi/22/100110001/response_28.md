The bug in the `Worker` class arises from the fact that the `last_active` parameter can be `None`, and when attempting to sum it with an integer value (the worker disconnect delay), it raises a `TypeError` due to unsupported operand types.

### Fix Strategy:
To fix this bug, we need to handle the case where `last_active` is `None` before attempting to perform any arithmetic operations with it.

### Corrected Version of the `Worker` class:
```python
def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
    self.id = worker_id
    self.reference = None
    self.last_active = last_active if last_active is not None else time.time()  # Set to current time if None
    self.started = time.time()
    self.tasks = set()
    self.info = {}
```

By initializing `last_active` to the current time if it is `None`, we ensure that it always holds a valid timestamp for comparison in the `prune` method. This fix will allow the corrected version to pass the failing test case.
