The bug in the `__init__` function is causing the error in the `worker.prune()` method. The `last_active` attribute is initialized as `None`, and when trying to access it in the `prune` method, it results in a `TypeError` because you cannot add an integer to `None`.

To fix this issue, you need to modify the initialization of the `last_active` attribute so that if it is not provided, it defaults to `time.time()`.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
    self.id = worker_id
    self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
    self.last_active = last_active if last_active is not None else time.time()  # seconds since epoch
    self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
    self.tasks = set()  # task objects
    self.info = {}
```

With this correction, the `last_active` attribute will default to the current time if no value is provided during initialization, preventing the `TypeError` when trying to add an integer to `None`.

After applying this fix, the failing test should pass without any errors.
