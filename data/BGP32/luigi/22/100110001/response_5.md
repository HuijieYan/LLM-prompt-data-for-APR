### Analysis:
The error message indicates a `TypeError` when trying to add `NoneType` and `int` in the `prune` method of the `Worker` class. This happens when `self.last_active` is `None` and the code tries to add `config.worker_disconnect_delay` to it.

### Bug Location:
The bug is located in the `prune` method where `self.last_active` is not checked for `None` before performing arithmetic operations with it.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is caused by initializing `last_active` in the `__init__` method with a default value of `None`, and then directly using it in the `prune` method without checking if it is `None` or not.

### Fix Strategy:
The fix would be to ensure that if `self.last_active` is `None`, then it should not be involved in arithmetic operations. We can introduce a conditional check to handle this scenario appropriately.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
    self.id = worker_id
    self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
    self.last_active = last_active  # seconds since epoch
    self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
    self.tasks = set()  # task objects
    self.info = {}

def prune(self, config):
    if self.last_active is not None and self.last_active + config.worker_disconnect_delay < time.time():
        # Only perform the operation if last_active is not None
        # Otherwise, do nothing as desired
        pass
```

By adding a check to ensure that `self.last_active` is not `None` before performing arithmetic operations, the corrected version will avoid the `TypeError` encountered in the failing test.
