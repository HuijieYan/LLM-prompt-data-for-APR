The bug in the __init__ function of the Worker class is that the parameter 'last_active' is set to None, which causes an issue when trying to add it to a integer value in the prune function. To fix this bug, we need to check if 'last_active' is None before performing operations on it.

Here is the corrected version of the __init__ function:

```python
def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
    self.id = worker_id
    self.reference = None
    self.last_active = last_active if last_active is not None else time.time()  # Set to current time if not provided
    self.started = time.time()
    self.tasks = set()
    self.info = {}
```

With this change, the 'last_active' parameter is initialized to the current time if None is passed, thus avoiding the TypeError when trying to add None to an integer value. The corrected version of the function should now pass the failing test without any issues.
