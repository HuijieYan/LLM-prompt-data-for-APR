The bug in the `__init__` function of the `Worker` class arises from the fact that the `last_active` parameter is defaulting to `None`. In the failing test `test_worker_prune_after_init`, the `prune` method is called on a `Worker` object with a configuration object that needs to check if `self.last_active` is less than a provided delay time. When trying to add `config.worker_disconnect_delay` to `self.last_active`, a `TypeError` is raised due to the mismatch in data types (`NoneType` and `int`).

To fix this bug, we need to ensure that `last_active` is properly initialized with seconds since epoch when it is not provided. One way to handle this is to set `last_active` to `time.time()` if it is not provided during object creation.

Here is the corrected version of the `__init__` function:

```python
def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
    self.id = worker_id
    self.reference = None
    self.last_active = last_active if last_active is not None else time.time()
    self.started = time.time()
    self.tasks = set()
    self.info = {}
```

Now, with this correction, the `last_active` attribute will default to the current time if not explicitly provided, preventing the `TypeError` when comparing it with an integer.

After applying this fix, the failing test `test_worker_prune_after_init` should pass successfully without any errors.
