### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `__init__` in the `Worker` class is missing the `self` parameter.
2. The error occurs in the `prune` method of the `Worker` class because `self.last_active` is initialized as `None` in the `__init__` method, causing the TypeError when trying to add an integer to `None`.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is caused by trying to add an integer to `None` in the `prune` method since `self.last_active` is initialized as `None` in the `__init__` method.

### Fix Strategy:
Initialize `self.last_active` with the specific value of `last_active` passed into the `__init__` method, if it's provided. If not, use the current time to initialize `last_active`.

### Corrected Code:
```python
def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
    self.id = worker_id
    self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
    self.last_active = last_active if last_active is not None else time.time()  # seconds since epoch
    self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
    self.tasks = set()  # task objects
    self.info = {}
```

By adding the check `last_active is not None`, we ensure that `self.last_active` is initialized with a valid value, either the provided `last_active` or the current time. This correction should resolve the TypeError in the failing test.
