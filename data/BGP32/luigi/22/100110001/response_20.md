The issue with the provided code is that the `last_active` attribute of the `Worker` class is initialized as `None`, causing a `TypeError` when trying to add an integer value to it in the `prune` method. The correction needed is to handle the case where `self.last_active` is `None` before performing the addition.

Here is the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
    self.id = worker_id
    self.reference = None
    self.last_active = last_active if last_active is not None else time.time()
    self.started = time.time()
    self.tasks = set()
    self.info = {}
```

By checking if `last_active` is `None` before assigning a value to `self.last_active`, we ensure that it defaults to the current time if no specific value is provided.

With this correction, the `prune` method should work correctly with the provided test case without raising a `TypeError`.
