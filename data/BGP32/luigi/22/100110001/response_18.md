The issue in the buggy function is related to the `self.last_active` attribute being initialized with a default value of `None`. When the `prune` method is called in the test and tries to perform arithmetic operations on `self.last_active`, which is `None`, it results in a `TypeError`.

To fix this bug, you need to ensure that if `last_active` is not provided during initialization, it should default to `0` instead of `None`. This way, calculations involving `last_active` will not result in a `TypeError`.

Here is the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=0):
    self.id = worker_id
    self.reference = None
    self.last_active = last_active
    self.started = time.time()
    self.tasks = set()
    self.info = {}
```

By setting `last_active` to `0` if not provided, the `self.last_active + config.worker_disconnect_delay` operation in the `prune` method will work correctly as both operands will be integers.

This corrected version should pass the failing test that was provided.
