The bug in the code is caused by the fact that the `last_active` attribute is initialized as `None`, and when attempting to perform an addition operation with `config.worker_disconnect_delay`, an unsupported operand type error is raised due to adding an integer to `None`.

To fix this bug, we need to provide a default value for `last_active` if it is not provided during initialization. In this case, we can set `last_active` to the current time using `time.time()` if no value is passed. This will ensure that `last_active` is always an integer representing seconds since epoch.

Here is the corrected version of the `__init__` function in the `Worker` class:

```python
def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
    self.id = worker_id
    self.reference = None
    self.last_active = last_active if last_active is not None else time.time()
    self.started = time.time()
    self.tasks = set()
    self.info = {}
```

With this modification, the `last_active` attribute will be initialized with the current time if no value is provided explicitly, avoiding the `NoneType` error in the test case.
