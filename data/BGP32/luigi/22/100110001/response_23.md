## Analysis:
1. The error occurs in the `prune` method of the `worker` object where it tries to check if the worker's `last_active` time plus the `config.worker_disconnect_delay` is less than the current time.
2. The error message highlights a `TypeError` caused by adding `NoneType` and `int` in the line: `if self.last_active + config.worker_disconnect_delay < time.time():`
3. The buggy function `__init__` initializes `last_active` parameter of the Worker class which can be `None`, and in the failing test, `prune` method tries to handle this `None` value leading to the error.
4. To fix the bug, we need to ensure that when `last_active` is not provided during initialization, the worker's `last_active` should default to a valid epoch time instead of `None`.

## Fix:
```python
def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
    self.id = worker_id
    self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
    self.last_active = last_active if last_active is not None else time.time()  # seconds since epoch
    self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
    self.tasks = set()  # task objects
    self.info = {}
``` 

By updating the initialization logic for `last_active`, the fixed code now handles cases where `last_active` is not provided and sets it to the current epoch time. This change ensures that the `prune` method can correctly compare the time values without encountering the `TypeError`.
