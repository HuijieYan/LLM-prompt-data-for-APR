The bug in the current implementation is that the `last_active` attribute of the `Worker` class is initialized with a default value of `None`, causing a `TypeError` when trying to perform arithmetic operations on it. To fix this bug, we need to ensure that a valid value (e.g., 0) is provided for `last_active` if no value is passed during initialization.

Here is the corrected version of the `Worker` class:

```python
# The corrected version of the buggy function
def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
    self.id = worker_id
    self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
    self.last_active = last_active if last_active is not None else 0  # seconds since epoch
    self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
    self.tasks = set()  # task objects
    self.info = {}
```

By providing a default value of 0 for `last_active` if it is not provided during initialization, we ensure that the arithmetic operation in the `prune` method will work correctly.

This corrected version should now pass the failing test without raising a `TypeError`.
