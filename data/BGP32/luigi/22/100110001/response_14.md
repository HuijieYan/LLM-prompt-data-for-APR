## Analysis:
1. The `Worker` class in the `luigi.scheduler` module has an `__init__` method that initializes various attributes including `last_active`.
2. The failing test `test_worker_prune_after_init` tries to create a `Worker` object and call the `prune` method on it with a custom configuration `TmpCfg`.
3. The error message indicates a `TypeError` at line 245 of `luigi/scheduler.py` which is caused by trying to perform an addition operation involving `NoneType`.
4. The bug is due to the default value of `last_active` in the `__init__` method being `None` which causes an issue when trying to add it to an integer in the `prune` method.

## Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to handle the case where `last_active` is `None` in the `prune` method before performing any operations on it. We can set a default value for `last_active` in the `__init__` method to avoid the `None` value.

## Corrected Version:
```python
import time

# Corrected version of the buggy function
def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=0):
    self.id = worker_id
    self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
    self.last_active = last_active if last_active is not None else 0  # seconds since epoch
    self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
    self.tasks = set()  # task objects
    self.info = {}
```

Now, with the default value for `last_active` set to `0`, the addition operation in the `prune` method won't raise a `TypeError` when `last_active` is `None`.

You can now run the failing test `test_worker_prune_after_init` which should pass with this corrected version of the `Worker` class.
