The bug in the provided function `__init__` is that the `last_active` parameter is allowed to be `None`, which leads to a `TypeError` when trying to add it to an integer value in the `prune` method of the `Worker` class. We need to handle the case where `last_active` is `None` gracefully.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
    self.id = worker_id
    self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
    self.last_active = last_active if last_active is not None else 0  # seconds since epoch, default to 0 if None
    self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
    self.tasks = set()  # task objects
    self.info = {}
```

By setting `self.last_active = last_active if last_active is not None else 0`, we ensure that `last_active` is always an integer value representing the seconds since epoch, even when it is not provided explicitly in the constructor.

With this correction, the `last_active` parameter will default to 0 if it is not specified, preventing the `TypeError` when trying to add it to the `worker_disconnect_delay` in the `prune` method. The corrected function will pass the failing test successfully.
