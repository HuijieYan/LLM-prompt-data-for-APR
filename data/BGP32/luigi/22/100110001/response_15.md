The issue in the provided buggy function is that the `last_active` attribute is set as `None` by default, and when trying to add an integer value to `None`, it results in a `TypeError`.

### Error Analysis:
- The failing test `test_worker_prune_after_init` is trying to test the `prune` method of the `Worker` class with a custom configuration object `TmpCfg` that sets `worker_disconnect_delay` to 10.

- The `prune` method tries to compare `self.last_active + config.worker_disconnect_delay` with the current time using `time.time()`. However, since `last_active` is initialized with `None` and there's no guard condition for when `last_active` is None, it raises a TypeError when trying to add an integer to `None`.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix this bug, we need to ensure that `last_active` is properly initialized with a default value that can be compared with an integer value without raising a TypeError. We can set it to zero if not provided during object initialization.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=0):
    self.id = worker_id
    self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
    self.last_active = last_active  # seconds since epoch or default to 0
    self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
    self.tasks = set()  # task objects
    self.info = {}
```

By setting the default value of `last_active` to 0, the bug should be resolved, and the corrected version of the `__init__` function should now pass the failing test without raising a TypeError.
