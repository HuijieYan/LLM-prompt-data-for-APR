The bug in the code is due to the `last_active` parameter being set to `None` by default, causing a `TypeError` when trying to perform addition with `time.time()`. To fix this, we need to handle the case when `last_active` is `None` and initialize it properly.

One way to fix this is by providing a default value for `last_active` in the function signature itself. We can set it to `None` and then check if it is `None` before performing any operations on it.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
    self.id = worker_id
    self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
    self.last_active = last_active if last_active is not None else time.time()  # seconds since epoch or current time
    self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
    self.tasks = set()  # task objects
    self.info = {}
```

With this fix, the `last_active` parameter will either take the provided value or default to the current time if no value is provided, avoiding the `TypeError`. The corrected function should pass the failing test and produce the expected input/output values.
