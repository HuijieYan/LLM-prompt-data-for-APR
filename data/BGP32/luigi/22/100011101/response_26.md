The bug in the provided code is due to the `last_active` parameter being set to `None` by default. When trying to add this `None` value with an integer in the `prune` method, a `TypeError` is raised.

To fix this bug, we need to ensure that `last_active` is set to the `last_active` parameter value if it's provided during initialization, or to the current time if not provided. This will prevent the `NoneType` error when trying to perform arithmetic operations on it in the `prune` method.

Here is the corrected version of the function:
```python
def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
    self.id = worker_id
    self.reference = None
    self.last_active = last_active if last_active is not None else time.time()
    self.started = time.time()
    self.tasks = set()
    self.info = {}
``` 

This fix ensures that `last_active` is set to the provided parameter value if not `None`, or to the current time if `None`. This will prevent the `TypeError` when trying to compare the `last_active` value in the `prune` method with the current time.
