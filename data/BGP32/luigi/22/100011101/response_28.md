The bug in the function is caused by the `last_active` parameter being set to `None` by default, leading to a `NoneType` error when trying to add it to an integer in the `prune` method.

To fix this bug, we need to initialize `last_active` to the current time if no value is provided. Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
    self.id = worker_id
    self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
    
    if last_active is not None:
        self.last_active = last_active
    else:
        self.last_active = time.time()
    
    self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
    self.tasks = set()  # task objects
    self.info = {}
```

This fix ensures that `last_active` is set to the current time if no value is provided, preventing the `NoneType` error when comparing it with an integer in the `prune` method.
