## Bug Explanation
The bug occurs because the `last_active` parameter has a default value of `None` in the `__init__` function of the `Worker` class. When the `prune` method is called and tries to compare `self.last_active + config.worker_disconnect_delay`, it attempts to add `None` (type `NoneType`) with an integer value, causing a `TypeError`. The comparison between `None` and an integer is not supported.

## Fix Strategy
To fix this bug, we need to ensure that `last_active` is always initialized to a float value instead of `None` in the `__init__` function of the `Worker` class. This way, we can perform arithmetic operations on `last_active` without encountering a `TypeError`.

## The corrected version of the function
```python
import time

class Worker:
    def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=time.time()):  # default to current time instead of None
        self.id = worker_id
        self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
        self.last_active = last_active  # seconds since epoch
        self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        self.tasks = set()  # task objects
        self.info = {}

    def prune(self, config):
        # Delete workers that haven't said anything for a while (probably killed)
        if self.last_active + config.worker_disconnect_delay < time.time():
            # Perform pruning logic here
            pass
```

By initializing `last_active` to the current time if no value is provided, we ensure that it is always a valid float value. This prevents the `TypeError` when performing arithmetic operations with `last_active`.
