The issue in the provided function is that `last_active` is set to `None` by default, causing a `TypeError` when trying to add an integer value to it in the `prune` method.

To fix this bug, we should handle the case where `last_active` is `None` to prevent the `TypeError`. We can set `last_active` to the current time when it's not provided in the constructor.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
import time

class Worker:
    def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
        self.id = worker_id
        self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
        self.last_active = last_active if last_active is not None else time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        self.tasks = set()  # task objects
        self.info = {}
    
    def prune(self, config):
        # Delete workers that haven't said anything for a while (probably killed)
        if self.last_active + config.worker_disconnect_delay < time.time():
            # prune logic here
            pass
```

This correction ensures that if `last_active` is not provided during initialization, it defaults to the current time, avoiding the `TypeError` when adding an integer value to it while performing pruning operations.
