The cause of the bug is that the `last_active` parameter is set to `None` by default in the `__init__` function, and when trying to perform an arithmetic operation with `self.last_active` (which is `None`) and an integer in the `prune` method, it results in a `TypeError`.

To fix this bug, you should initialize `self.last_active` with the value of `last_active` if it's provided, or set it to the current time using `time.time()` if `last_active` is not provided.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
import time

# The relative path of the buggy file: luigi/scheduler.py

# Corrected version of the function
def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
    self.id = worker_id
    self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
    if last_active is not None:
        self.last_active = last_active  # seconds since epoch
    else:
        self.last_active = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
    self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
    self.tasks = set()  # task objects
    self.info = {}
```

With this correction, the `prune` method should now work correctly without causing a `TypeError`.
