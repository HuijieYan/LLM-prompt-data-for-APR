The bug in the provided function is due to the `last_active` parameter having a default value of `None`, which causes a `TypeError` when trying to add it to an integer in the `prune` method.

To fix this bug, we need to ensure that `last_active` is set to the provided value if it is not `None`. If `last_active` is not provided, we can set it to `time.time()`.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
    self.id = worker_id
    self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
    if last_active is not None:
        self.last_active = last_active  # seconds since epoch
    else:
        self.last_active = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
    self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
    self.tasks = set()  # task objects
    self.info = {}
```

This corrected version of the function ensures that `last_active` is always initialized correctly and avoids the `TypeError` when adding it to an integer in the `prune` method.
