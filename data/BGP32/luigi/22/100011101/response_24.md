The bug in the provided function is that the `last_active` parameter defaults to `None`, causing a `TypeError` when trying to add an integer to `None`. To fix this issue, we need to ensure that `last_active` is always initialized to a default value if not provided.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
    self.id = worker_id
    self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
    if last_active is None:
        last_active = time.time()  # Initialize last_active to the current time if not provided
    self.last_active = last_active  # seconds since epoch
    self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
    self.tasks = set()  # task objects
    self.info = {}
```

With this modification, the `last_active` variable will default to the current time if it is not provided, ensuring that the addition operation in the `prune` method does not result in a `TypeError`. This corrected version should now pass the failing test and produce the expected output values.
