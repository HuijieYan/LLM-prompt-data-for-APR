## Bug Explanation
The bug occurs because the `last_active` parameter is set to `None` by default in the function definition, leading to a `TypeError` when trying to add an integer to a `NoneType` object in the `prune` method.

## Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to check if `last_active` is `None` in the `__init__` method and handle this case appropriately.

## The corrected version of the function
```python
def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
    self.id = worker_id
    self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
    if last_active is None:
        self.last_active = time.time()  # Initialize last_active to current time if not provided
    else:
        self.last_active = last_active
    self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
    self.tasks = set()  # task objects
    self.info = {}
```
