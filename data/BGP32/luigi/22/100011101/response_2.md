The issue in the provided buggy function is due to the `last_active` parameter being optional and defaulting to `None`, which causes a `TypeError` when trying to add an integer value to it in the `prune` method.

To fix this issue, we need to ensure that if `last_active` is not provided as an argument during initialization, it should default to the current time in seconds since epoch.

Here is the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
    self.id = worker_id
    self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
    self.last_active = last_active if last_active is not None else time.time()  # seconds since epoch
    self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
    self.tasks = set()  # task objects
    self.info = {}
```

With this correction, the `last_active` parameter will default to the current time in seconds since epoch if not provided, ensuring that the addition operation in the `prune` method does not encounter a `TypeError`.

This fix will allow the `prune` method to work correctly and satisfy the expected input/output values, resolving the `TypeError` issue identified in the failing test case.
