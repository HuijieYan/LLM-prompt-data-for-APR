The bug in the provided code is due to the `last_active` parameter having a default value of `None`. When the `prune` method is called, it tries to add the `last_active` parameter (which is `None` in this case) to an integer `config.worker_disconnect_delay`. This results in a `TypeError` due to the unsupported operand types.

To fix the bug, we can modify the `__init__` function to handle the case where `last_active` is not provided by setting it to the current time if `last_active` is `None`.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
    self.id = worker_id
    self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
    if last_active is None:
        self.last_active = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
    else:
        self.last_active = last_active
    self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
    self.tasks = set()  # task objects
    self.info = {}
```

With this correction, the `last_active` attribute is initialized with the current time if no value is provided, ensuring that it doesn't remain as `None`. This change will allow the `prune` method to correctly compare the time values without raising a `TypeError`.

Make sure to update the `Worker` class in the appropriate file with this corrected `__init__` function to resolve the bug and pass the failing test.
