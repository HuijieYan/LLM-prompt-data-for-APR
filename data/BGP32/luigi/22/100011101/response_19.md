## Bug Explanation
The bug is caused by the `last_active` parameter being set to `None` as a default value in the `__init__` function of the `Worker` class. When trying to add `last_active` with an integer value in the `prune` function, a `TypeError` occurs due to the unsupported operation between `None` and `int`.

## Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that `last_active` is always initialized with a valid integer value in the `__init__` function. This can be achieved by providing a default integer value instead of `None` for the `last_active` parameter.

## The Corrected Version
```python
# The corrected version of the __init__ function
def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=0):
    self.id = worker_id
    self.reference = None
    self.last_active = last_active
    self.started = time.time()
    self.tasks = set()
    self.info = {}
```

With this corrected version, the `last_active` parameter is initialized with `0` instead of `None` when not provided, ensuring that it is always set to a valid integer value. This change should resolve the `TypeError` when adding `last_active` with an integer value in the `prune` function.
