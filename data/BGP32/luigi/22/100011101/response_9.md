The bug in the provided function arises from the fact that the `last_active` parameter is defaulted to `None`, but when the `prune` method is called, it tries to perform arithmetic operations with `None` resulting in a TypeError.

To fix this bug, we need to ensure that if `last_active` is not provided, it should default to the current time, which is what the intention of the code seems to be. 

Here is the corrected version of the function:
```python
def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
    self.id = worker_id
    self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
    self.last_active = last_active if last_active is not None else time.time()  # seconds since epoch
    self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
    self.tasks = set()  # task objects
    self.info = {}
```

By checking if `last_active` is `None` before assigning the default value of `time.time()`, we ensure that the `last_active` variable will only be set to the current time when it is not explicitly provided. This change addresses the TypeError that was occurring when trying to perform arithmetic operations with `None`.

This corrected version of the function should now pass the failing test and maintain the expected input/output values.
