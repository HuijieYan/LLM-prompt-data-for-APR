The bug in the code arises from the fact that the `last_active` parameter of the `__init__` function is set to `None` by default, which leads to a `NoneType` error when attempting to add the `worker_disconnect_delay` to it in the `prune` method.

To fix this bug, we need to ensure that if `last_active` is not provided during the initialization of the `Worker` object, it should default to the current time using `time.time()`.

Here is the corrected version of the code:

```python
def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
    self.id = worker_id
    self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
    self.last_active = last_active if last_active is not None else time.time()  # seconds since epoch or current time
    self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
    self.tasks = set()  # task objects
    self.info = {}
```

With this fix, the `last_active` parameter in the `__init__` function will default to the current time if not provided, preventing the `NoneType` error in the `prune` method.
