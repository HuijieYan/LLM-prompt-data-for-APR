## Fixing the buggy function

### Problem identified:
The issue in the code arises from the fact that the `last_active` parameter can be passed as `None`, leading to a `NoneType` error when trying to calculate the next active time.

### Solution:
We need to handle the case where `last_active` is `None` and provide a default value if it is not specified in the function call.

### Corrected version of the function:
```python
def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
    self.id = worker_id
    self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
    self.last_active = last_active if last_active is not None else time.time()  # seconds since epoch or current time
    self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
    self.tasks = set()  # task objects
    self.info = {}
```

By modifying the assignment of `self.last_active`, we ensure that if `last_active` is not provided, it defaults to the current time. This change resolves the issue with the `NoneType` error when trying to calculate the next active time.
