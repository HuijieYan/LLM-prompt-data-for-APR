The issue in the buggy function is that the `last_active` parameter is set to `None` by default, causing a `TypeError` when trying to perform arithmetic operations with `None` and an integer in the `prune` method.

To fix this issue, we can modify the `__init__` method to provide a default value for `last_active` if it is not explicitly provided.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
    self.id = worker_id
    self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
    self.last_active = last_active if last_active is not None else time.time()  # seconds since epoch
    self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
    self.tasks = set()  # task objects
    self.info = {}
```

This modification ensures that if `last_active` is not provided during the initialization of the `Worker` object, it will default to the current time using `time.time()`.

By making this change, the test `test_worker_prune_after_init` should pass without raising a `TypeError`.
