The issue in the buggy function arises from the `last_active` parameter being set to `None` by default, causing a `TypeError` when trying to add an integer to it. To fix this issue, we need to ensure that `last_active` is initialized to the correct value if it is not provided.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
    self.id = worker_id
    self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
    self.last_active = last_active if last_active is not None else time.time()  # seconds since epoch
    self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
    self.tasks = set()  # task objects
    self.info = {}
```

This corrected version checks if `last_active` is provided during initialization. If it is not provided (`None`), then the current time will be used to initialize `last_active`. This modification ensures that the `last_active` variable will always have a valid value and no `TypeError` will occur when trying to add an integer to it.
