The bug in the provided function is that the `last_active` parameter is allowed to be `None`, which leads to a `TypeError` when trying to perform arithmetic operations on it in the `prune` method. To fix this bug, we need to ensure that `last_active` is always initialized to a valid value when the `Worker` object is created.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
# The corrected version of the buggy function
def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
    self.id = worker_id
    self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
    self.last_active = last_active if last_active is not None else time.time()  # seconds since epoch
    self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
    self.tasks = set()  # task objects
    self.info = {}
```

By this correction, if the `last_active` parameter is not provided during the `Worker` object instantiation, it will default to the current time using `time.time()`, ensuring that `last_active` is always initialized to a valid value.

This correction will ensure that the `prune` method will not encounter a `TypeError` when trying to perform arithmetic operations with `last_active`.
