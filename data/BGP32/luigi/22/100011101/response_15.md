Based on the error message and the provided information, the bug in the buggy function is caused by `self.last_active` being initialized as `None`. This leads to a `TypeError` when trying to add an integer (config.worker_disconnect_delay) to `None` in the `prune` method.

To fix this bug, we need to ensure that `last_active` is initialized with a default value if no value is provided during object creation.

Here is the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
import time

class Worker:
    def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
        self.id = worker_id
        self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
        self.last_active = last_active if last_active is not None else time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        self.tasks = set()  # task objects
        self.info = {}

    def prune(self, config):
        # Delete workers that haven't said anything for a while (probably killed)
        if self.last_active + config.worker_disconnect_delay < time.time():
            print("Worker pruned successfully")

# Output the corrected Worker object after fixing the bug
worker = Worker(123)
worker.prune(TmpCfg())
```

With this correction, the `last_active` attribute of the `Worker` class will default to the current time if not explicitly provided. This change ensures that the `TypeError` encountered during the test will be resolved, and the test `test_worker_prune_after_init` should pass successfully.
