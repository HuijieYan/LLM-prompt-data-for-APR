## Solution

### Analysis
The error message indicates a `TypeError` due to attempting to add `NoneType` and `int` in the expression `self.last_active + config.worker_disconnect_delay`. This error occurs when `last_active` is `None`. To fix this bug, we need to ensure that `last_active` is properly initialized if `None`, possibly by setting it to the current timestamp when `last_active` is not provided as an argument.

### Fix
I will modify the `__init__` function to ensure that `last_active` is initialized properly, and if not provided, it will default to the current time.

### Corrected Function
```python
def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
    self.id = worker_id
    self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
    self.last_active = last_active if last_active is not None else time.time()  # seconds since epoch
    self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
    self.tasks = set()  # task objects
    self.info = {}
```

By adding the condition `if last_active is not None else time.time()`, we ensure that `last_active` will be initialized with the current time if it is not provided. This modification addresses the bug by handling the case where `last_active` is `None` during initialization.
