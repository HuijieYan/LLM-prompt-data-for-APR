The bug in the provided function is due to the `last_active` parameter being set to `None` by default, causing a `TypeError` when trying to add `config.worker_disconnect_delay` to it since you can't perform addition on a `None` type and an integer.

To fix this bug, we need to check if `last_active` is `None` and set it to the current time in that case. This will ensure that we always have a valid timestamp to work with.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
    self.id = worker_id
    self.reference = None
    if last_active is None:
        last_active = time.time()  # setting default last_active to current time if not provided
    self.last_active = last_active
    self.started = time.time()
    self.tasks = set()
    self.info = {}
```

With this correction, the function will now properly initialize the `last_active` attribute even when it's not explicitly provided, avoiding the `TypeError` that was previously occurring. The function should now pass the failing test successfully.
