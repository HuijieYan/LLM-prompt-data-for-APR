The bug in the `__init__` function of the `Worker` class is due to the `last_active=None` default argument. When `last_active` is not provided during object creation, it defaults to `None`. Later in the code, when checking if `self.last_active + config.worker_disconnect_delay < time.time()`, it results in a `TypeError` because you cannot add `None` (NoneType) to an integer (`time.time()`).

To fix this bug, you can modify the default argument `last_active=None` to set it to the current time if it is not provided during object creation. This way, it guarantees that `last_active` is always initialized with a valid timestamp.

Here is the corrected version of the `__init__` function:

```python
def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
    self.id = worker_id
    self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
    self.last_active = last_active if last_active is not None else time.time()  # seconds since epoch
    self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
    self.tasks = set()  # task objects
    self.info = {}
```

After applying this fix, the `Worker` object will always have a valid `last_active` timestamp, either provided by the user or initialized to the current time. This change ensures that the comparison with `time.time()` will work correctly without raising a `TypeError`.
