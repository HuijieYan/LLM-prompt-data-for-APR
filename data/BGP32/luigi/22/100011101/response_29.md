The bug in the provided code is due to the `last_active` parameter being `None` by default and causing a `TypeError` when trying to add an integer to `None`.

To fix this bug, we can assign the current time to `last_active` if it is not provided during initialization. This ensures that `last_active` will always have a valid timestamp.

Here is the corrected version of the function:
```python
def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
    self.id = worker_id
    self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
    
    if last_active is not None:
        self.last_active = last_active
    else:
        self.last_active = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
    
    self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
    self.tasks = set()  # task objects
    self.info = {}
```

With this fix, the `last_active` parameter will default to the current time if not provided, avoiding the `TypeError` when trying to perform arithmetic operations with `None`.
