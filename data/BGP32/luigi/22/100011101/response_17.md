## Bug Explanation
The error message is raised because the `last_active` parameter is initialized as `None` in the `__init__` function, and when trying to add `config.worker_disconnect_delay` to it, it causes a `TypeError` since you can't add an integer to `None`.

## Fix Strategy
To fix this bug, we need to check if the `last_active` parameter is `None` before performing any operations with it. If it is `None`, we should set it to the current time using `time.time()`.

## The corrected version of the function
```python
def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
    self.id = worker_id
    self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
    self.last_active = last_active if last_active is not None else time.time()  # seconds since epoch
    self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
    self.tasks = set()  # task objects
    self.info = {}
```
