The bug in the provided code is due to the `last_active` variable being set to `None` as a default value. This causes the TypeError when trying to add an integer to `None` in the `prune` method.

To fix this issue, we need to handle the case when `last_active` is `None` by providing a default value for it. One common approach is to set it to the current time when it is not provided. 

Here is the corrected version of the `__init__` method that addresses the bug:

```python
def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
    self.id = worker_id
    self.reference = None
    self.last_active = last_active if last_active is not None else time.time()  # Set default value to current time if last_active is None
    self.started = time.time()
    self.tasks = set()
    self.info = {}
```

By setting a default value to `last_active` based on the current time when it is `None`, the bug causing the TypeError should be resolved. This change ensures that `last_active` always holds a valid value, whether it is explicitly provided or not.
