To fix the bug in the provided function, we need to ensure that the `last_active` parameter is properly initialized when it is not provided. As the error message indicates that there is an issue with adding `NoneType` and `int`, we need to set a default value for `last_active` that is not `None`.

Here's a corrected version of the function:

```python
def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
    self.id = worker_id
    self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
    
    if last_active is None:
        last_active = time.time()
        
    self.last_active = last_active  # seconds since epoch
    self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
    self.tasks = set()  # task objects
    self.info = {}
```

Explanation:
- In the corrected version, we added a check to see if `last_active` is `None`. If it is `None`, we set it to the current time using `time.time()`, ensuring that it is always an integer value representing seconds since epoch.
- By ensuring that `last_active` is always an integer value, we prevent the TypeError that occurred when trying to add `NoneType` and `int`.

This corrected version should allow the function to work as expected and pass the failing test.
