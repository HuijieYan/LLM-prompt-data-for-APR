## Solution:
The issue in the buggy function is that it assigns `None` to `self.last_active` by default, which causes a `TypeError` when trying to perform addition with an integer in the `prune` method. To fix this bug, we need to initialize `self.last_active` to a valid time value if `last_active` is not provided.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
# The corrected function
def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
    self.id = worker_id
    self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
    self.last_active = last_active if last_active is not None else time.time()  # seconds since epoch
    self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
    self.tasks = set()  # task objects
    self.info = {}
```

By initializing `self.last_active` as `time.time()` if `last_active` is not provided, we can ensure that it always has a valid time value, preventing the `TypeError` when comparing it in the `prune` method.

This corrected version should pass the failing test and satisfy the expected input/output values provided.
