## Analysis
The error message indicates a `TypeError` due to trying to add a `NoneType` and an `int` in the line `if self.last_active + config.worker_disconnect_delay < time.time():`. This error occurs because `last_active` is initialized as `None` in the `__init__` function.

## Bug Fix
To fix this issue, we need to ensure that `last_active` is set to the input parameter `last_active` if it is provided in the `__init__` function. If `last_active` is not provided, we should set it to `None`.
Additionally, we need to adjust the comparison in the `prune` function to check if `last_active` is not `None` before performing the subtraction operation.

Here is the corrected version of the function:
```python
def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
    self.id = worker_id
    self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
    self.last_active = last_active if last_active is not None else None  # seconds since epoch
    self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
    self.tasks = set()  # task objects
    self.info = {}

def prune(self, config):
    if self.last_active is not None and self.last_active + config.worker_disconnect_delay < time.time():
        # Perform the pruning operation
        pass
```

By updating the `__init__` function to correctly handle the `last_active` parameter and adjusting the comparison in the `prune` function to check for `None`, the error should be resolved.
