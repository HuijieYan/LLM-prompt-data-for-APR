The issue in the buggy function is that when the `last_active` parameter is not provided, it defaults to `None`. Later in the code, it tries to add this `None` value with an integer value, which causes a `TypeError`.

To fix this bug, we need to ensure that if `last_active` is not provided, it should default to the current time. This way, we avoid the `NoneType` error when adding it to an integer value.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
    self.id = worker_id
    self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
    self.last_active = last_active if last_active is not None else time.time()  # seconds since epoch
    self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
    self.tasks = set()  # task objects
    self.info = {}
```

This corrected version ensures that `last_active` defaults to the current time if not provided, preventing the `TypeError` when performing arithmetic operations in the `prune` method.
