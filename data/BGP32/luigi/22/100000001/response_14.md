## Analysis:
The provided function is missing the `self` parameter in its definition, making it an instance method that cannot access instance attributes. This will result in an error where the function tries to access instance attributes without the `self` reference.

## Error Locations:
1. Missing `self` parameter in the function definition.
2. Instance attributes are being accessed without `self`.

## Bug Cause:
The buggy function lacks the `self` parameter in its definition, causing it to be unable to access instance attributes like `id`, `reference`, `last_active`, etc. This leads to potential errors or unexpected behavior when trying to use these attributes.

## Strategy to Fix the Bug:
1. Add the `self` parameter to the function definition to make it an instance method.
2. Replace attribute references like `self.id`, `self.reference`, `self.last_active`, etc., instead of `id`, `reference`, `last_active`, etc., within the function.

## Corrected Version:
```python
# The corrected version of the function
def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
    self.id = worker_id
    self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
    self.last_active = last_active  # seconds since epoch
    self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
    self.tasks = set()  # task objects
    self.info = {}
```

By adding `self.` before the attribute references within the function, we ensure that the function can correctly access the instance attributes of the class instance.
