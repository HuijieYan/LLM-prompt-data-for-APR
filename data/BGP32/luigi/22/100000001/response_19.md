The buggy function provided is an `__init__` method of a class but seems to be missing the class definition itself. The potential error locations within the function could be a missing class definition, incorrect use of the `self` parameter, and the use of `time.time()` without importing the `time` module.

The cause of the bug is that the method is defined as an `__init__` method without being inside a class definition. To fix this bug, the method should be placed inside a class definition.

A strategy for fixing the bug would involve creating a class definition that contains the `__init__` method and ensuring that the necessary imports are present. 

Here is the corrected version of the function with a class definition and proper use of the `time` module:
```python
# The corrected version of the function
import time

class Worker:
    def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
        self.id = worker_id
        self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
        self.last_active = last_active  # seconds since epoch
        self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        self.tasks = set()  # task objects
        self.info = {}
```

This corrected code defines a class named `Worker` with the `__init__` method that initializes the attributes of a worker object.
