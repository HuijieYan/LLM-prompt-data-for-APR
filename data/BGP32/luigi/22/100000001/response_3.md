## Analysis:
The buggy function is missing the class definition, which indicates that it might be part of a class and should be within a class definition.

## Error:
The function should be inside a class definition to properly initialize the attributes of the class.

## Cause:
The function is defined as `__init__` which suggests it should be the constructor of a class, but it is missing the class definition. This causes the function to be standalone and not associated with any class, resulting in incorrect initialization of attributes.

## Strategy:
Create a class definition and encapsulate the function within the class to ensure proper initialization of attributes.

## Corrected Version:
```python
import time

class Worker:
    def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
        self.id = worker_id
        self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
        self.last_active = last_active  # seconds since epoch
        self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        self.tasks = set()  # task objects
        self.info = {}

# Instantiate the Worker class
worker = Worker("12345")
``` 

In this corrected version, the `__init__` function is now enclosed within a class named `Worker`. You can create an instance of the `Worker` class by instantiating it with appropriate parameters. This will ensure proper initialization of the attributes for each worker object.
