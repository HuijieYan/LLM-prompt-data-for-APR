Buggy Function Analysis:
The buggy function appears to be a constructor method (__init__) for a class, as it initializes various attributes of an object. The issue with the function lies in the fact that it is missing the class definition, which is essential for object-oriented Python programming.

Potential Error Location:
The lack of a class definition in the provided code snippet is the primary cause of the bug. Without a class wrapping around the constructor function, an error will be raised when attempting to create an instance of the object using this constructor.

Cause of the Bug:
The function lacks a class definition, thereby preventing the correct instantiation of an object from this constructor. In Python, all class methods, including the constructor, must be defined within a class.

Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to wrap the provided constructor function within a class. By doing so, the function can be used to initialize objects of that class correctly.

Corrected Version:
```python
import time

class Worker:
    def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
        self.id = worker_id
        self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
        self.last_active = last_active  # seconds since epoch
        self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        self.tasks = set()  # task objects
        self.info = {}

# Create an instance of the Worker class
worker = Worker(worker_id=1)
```
