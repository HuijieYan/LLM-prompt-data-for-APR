The bug in the provided function is the incorrect usage of the `__init__` method. The code is meant to be a part of a class in Python, but it lacks the class definition itself. The `__init__` method should be inside a class and must have `self` as the first parameter.

Here's the corrected version of the function:
```python
import time

class Worker:
    def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
        self.id = worker_id
        self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
        self.last_active = last_active  # seconds since epoch
        self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        self.tasks = set()  # task objects
        self.info = {}
```

To correct the bug:
1. Define a class (in this case, `Worker`) that encapsulates the attributes.
2. Move the `__init__` method inside the class and include the `self` parameter as the first argument.
3. Use the correct class name (`Worker`) when calling the `__init__` method.

With these corrections, the function should work correctly within the context of a class definition.
