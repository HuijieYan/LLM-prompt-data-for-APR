The buggy function is the `__init__` method within a class in the file `luigi/scheduler.py`. This method is intended to initialize attributes for a worker object, such as `id`, `reference`, `last_active`, `started`, `tasks`, and `info`.

The potential error locations within the buggy function:
1. The `__init__` method is missing the `self` parameter in its signature, which is necessary to refer to the instance being created.
2. The `import time` statement is not within the function, although it is used for setting the `started` attribute.

The cause of the bug in the buggy function is that the `self` parameter is missing in the method signature, which will lead to errors related to accessing instance attributes. Additionally, the use of `time.time()` outside a function scope could potentially cause issues if the code is executed before the necessary imports are available.

To fix the bug:
1. Add the missing `self` parameter to the `__init__` method signature.
2. Move the import statement `import time` into the function to ensure it is available when setting the `started` attribute.

Corrected version of the function:
```python
# The corrected __init__ method
class Worker:
    def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
        self.id = worker_id
        self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
        self.last_active = last_active  # seconds since epoch
        import time
        self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        self.tasks = set()  # task objects
        self.info = {}
```
