## Analysis:
- The function `__init__` is the constructor method for a class, but it is missing the class definition.
- The `self` parameter is used as the first parameter in the function, indicating that it should be a method of a class.
- The function tries to initialize attributes for an object, but without being part of a class, it has no instance to bind the attributes to.

## Potential Errors:
- Class definition is missing.
- Incorrect usage of `self` without a class context.

## Bug Explanation:
The bug occurs because the `__init__` function is written as a standalone function instead of a method within a class. This results in the function not having a class context to initialize attributes for an object using `self`.

## Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Define a class that encompasses the attributes and methods related to the worker.
2. Incorporate the `__init__` method within the class to correctly initialize the object's attributes using `self`.

## Corrected Version:
```python
import time

class Worker:
    def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
        self.id = worker_id
        self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
        self.last_active = last_active  # seconds since epoch
        self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        self.tasks = set()  # task objects
        self.info = {}

# Creating an instance of the Worker class
worker = Worker(worker_id=123)
```
