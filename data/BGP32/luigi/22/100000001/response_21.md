## Corrected Version:

```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: luigi/scheduler.py

import time

def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
    self.id = worker_id
    self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
    self.last_active = last_active if last_active is not None else time.time()  # seconds since epoch
    self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
    self.tasks = set()  # task objects
    self.info = {}

```


## Analysis:
The buggy function `__init__` is missing a check for `last_active` being `None` before assigning `time.time()` to it. This can lead to incorrect initialization of `last_active` when a value is not provided during object creation. The initial implementation assigns `time.time()` to `last_active` unconditionally which can lead to inconsistencies.

## Potential Error Locations:
1. Incorrect initialization of the `last_active` attribute.
2. Lack of validation for `last_active` input.

## Cause of the Bug:
The bug occurs due to the unconditional assignment of `time.time()` to `last_active`, potentially overriding the user-supplied value for `last_active`.

## Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to check if `last_active` is `None` before setting it to `time.time()`. This ensures that if the user provides a value for `last_active`, it will be used, otherwise set it to the current time.

By adding a conditional statement to the assignment of `last_active`, we ensure that the user-provided value is honored, and if no value is provided, it defaults to the current time during object creation.
