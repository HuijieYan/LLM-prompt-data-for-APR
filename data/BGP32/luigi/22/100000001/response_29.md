## Analysis:
The `__init__` function has an issue where the `time` module is being used without importing it.

## Error Location:
The error is present in the line:
```python
self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
```

## Cause of the Bug:
The `time` module is being used directly without importing it first, leading to a `NameError` as `time` is undefined in the context of the function.

## Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To resolve this issue, we need to include the `import time` statement at the beginning of the file to make the `time` module available for use within the function.

## Corrected Version:
```python
import time

def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
    self.id = worker_id
    self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
    self.last_active = last_active  # seconds since epoch
    self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
    self.tasks = set()  # task objects
    self.info = {}
```
