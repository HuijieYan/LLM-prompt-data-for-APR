The buggy function is the `__init__` method of a class in the file `luigi/scheduler.py`. The function is intended to initialize certain attributes of the class instance.

The potential error in the function lies in the `last_active` parameter. The function is setting `self.last_active` to the value passed in the parameter `last_active`. However, if `last_active` is not provided, the function should set `self.last_active` to `None`. 

The bug in the function is that while `last_active` is set as an optional parameter with a default value of `None`, the logic inside the function does not handle cases when `last_active` is not provided. It will raise a `TypeError` because `None` cannot be serialized using `time.time()`.

To fix this bug, we can modify the logic to check if `last_active` is `None` before using it to set `self.last_active`. If it is `None`, we can initialize `self.last_active` to `None`, otherwise, we can use the provided `last_active` value.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
    self.id = worker_id
    self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
    if last_active is not None:
        self.last_active = last_active  # seconds since epoch
    else:
        self.last_active = None
    self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
    self.tasks = set()  # task objects
    self.info = {}
``` 

With this modification, the function will correctly initialize the `self.last_active` attribute based on whether the `last_active` parameter is provided or not.
