The issue in the provided function is that the `__init__` method is not defined within a class. The `__init__` method is typically used in Python classes to initialize instance variables when an object is created.

To fix the bug:
1. Define a class for which the `__init__` method should be a part of.
2. Pass `self` as the first argument to the `__init__` method.
3. Include any necessary arguments after `self`, such as `worker_id` and `last_active`.

Here is the corrected version of the buggy function:
```python
# The corrected version of the function
import time

class Scheduler:
    def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
        self.id = worker_id
        self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
        self.last_active = last_active  # seconds since epoch
        self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        self.tasks = set()  # task objects
        self.info = {}
```

Now, the `__init__` method is defined within the `Scheduler` class, ensuring that the instance variables are properly initialized when an object of the `Scheduler` class is created.
