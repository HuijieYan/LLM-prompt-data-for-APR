### Analysis:
The __init__ function provided seems to be a constructor for a worker object in a job scheduling system. The bug in this function is related to the default argument `last_active=None`. The bug occurs because default mutable arguments (like dictionaries or lists) are created only once when the function is defined, and not every time the function is called with a missing argument. This means that if `last_active` is not provided when creating a new worker, all workers would end up sharing the same `last_active` dictionary instance.

### Error Location:
The potential error location lies in the line `self.last_active = last_active`.

### Cause of the Bug:
The bug is caused by the mutable default argument for `last_active`, which leads to shared state among all worker instances.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix this bug, we need to avoid using a mutable default argument. One common approach is to use `None` as the default and then check if the argument is `None` inside the function to provide a new dictionary if needed.

### Corrected Version:
```python
# The corrected version of the function
def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
    self.id = worker_id
    self.reference = None
    self.last_active = {} if last_active is None else last_active
    self.started = time.time()
    self.tasks = set()
    self.info = {}
```
