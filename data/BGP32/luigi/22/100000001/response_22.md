The buggy function is an `__init__` method of a class without the class definition provided. From the context given, it seems like this method is supposed to initialize attributes of a worker instance.

### Potential Error Locations:
1. Incorrect parameter usage: The `__init__` method should have 'self' as its first parameter, but 'self' seems to be missing in the provided code.
2. Uninitialized 'self' variables: The 'self' variables `id`, `reference`, `last_active`, `started`, `tasks`, and `info` are being assigned values without being declared in the code snippet, which is a potential issue.

### Bug Explanation:
The bug in the provided code is due to the missing 'self' parameter in the `__init__` method, causing the instance attributes to be set on the class rather than the instance itself. This can lead to incorrect behavior when creating worker instances.

### Strategy to Fix the Bug:
1. Add the 'self' parameter as the first parameter of the `__init__` method.
2. Define a class containing the `__init__` method and declare 'self' variables within the class.

### Corrected Version:
```python
import time

# Define the worker class
class Worker:
    def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
        self.id = worker_id
        self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
        self.last_active = last_active  # seconds since epoch
        self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        self.tasks = set()  # task objects
        self.info = {}

# Create an instance of the Worker class
worker = Worker("worker_id_value")

# Accessing attributes of the worker instance
print(worker.id)
print(worker.reference)
print(worker.last_active)
print(worker.started)
print(worker.tasks)
print(worker.info)
``` 

In this corrected version, we have defined a `Worker` class with the `__init__` method properly declared. By instantiating the `Worker` class, we can create worker instances with the specified attributes initialized correctly.
