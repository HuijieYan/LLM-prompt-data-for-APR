The bug in the provided code is that the `__init__` function is missing the `self` parameter. In Python, the `self` parameter is used to refer to the instance of the class. Without the `self` parameter, the function will not have access to the instance attributes and will raise an error when trying to access `worker_id`, `last_active`, etc.

To fix this bug, we need to add the `self` parameter to the `__init__` function. Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
    self.id = worker_id
    self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
    self.last_active = last_active  # seconds since epoch
    self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
    self.tasks = set()  # task objects
    self.info = {}
```

With this corrected code, the `__init__` function now accepts the `self` parameter, allowing it to properly initialize the instance attributes when a new instance of the class is created.
