The bug in the provided function `__init__` is that it is missing the `self` parameter in the function definition. In Python, when defining instance methods within a class, the first parameter should always be `self` to refer to the instance itself.

To fix this bug, we need to add the `self` parameter to the `__init__` function definition. 

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: luigi/scheduler.py

# corrected version of the function
def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
    self.id = worker_id
    self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
    self.last_active = last_active  # seconds since epoch
    self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
    self.tasks = set()  # task objects
    self.info = {}
```

By adding the `self` parameter, the function will now correctly refer to the instance of the class when setting the attributes.
