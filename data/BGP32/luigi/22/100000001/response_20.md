The bug in the provided function is related to the incorrect use of the `__init__` method in a class definition. The function is missing the class declaration and should be part of a class definition. 

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
# The correct version of the function
class Scheduler:
    def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
        self.id = worker_id
        self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
        self.last_active = last_active  # seconds since epoch
        self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        self.tasks = set()  # task objects
        self.info = {}
```

By defining the function within a class named `Scheduler`, we encapsulate the attributes and methods related to a scheduler. The corrected version ensures that the `__init__` function initializes the attributes correctly within the context of the class.

To further improve the code, you may consider adding more methods to the `Scheduler` class to handle operations related to scheduling tasks, updating worker status, etc.
