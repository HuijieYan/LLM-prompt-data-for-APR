There are a few potential errors in the buggy function provided:
1. The function `__init__` is missing the class definition.
2. The usage of `self.id` without initializing `self` as an instance of a class.
3. Initializing `self.reference` without passing any arguments.

To fix the bugs in the function:
1. Define a class that will have the `__init__` method.
2. Pass the `worker_id` and `last_active` as arguments to the `__init__` method.
3. Initialize `self` as an instance of the class within the `__init__` method.

Here is the corrected version of the function:
```python
import time

class Worker:
    def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
        self.id = worker_id
        self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
        self.last_active = last_active  # seconds since epoch
        self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        self.tasks = set()  # task objects
        self.info = {}

# Example usage:
worker = Worker("Worker1")
print(worker.id)  # Output: Worker1
```
