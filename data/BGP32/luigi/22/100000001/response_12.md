## Analysis:
The buggy function is missing the `self` parameter in its definition, indicating that it is meant to be a method within a class. This is evident from the use of `self.id`, `self.last_active`, `self.started`, etc. within the function. This suggests that the code is intended to be part of a class definition in Python.

## Identified potential error location:
The absence of the `self` parameter in the function indicates that it might be intended to be part of a class definition, which is missing in the provided code. This will lead to an error if attempted to be called as a standalone function.

## Cause of the bug:
The function is defined without the `self` parameter, which is crucial for referencing instance attributes within a class method in Python. Due to this omission, the class attributes are being set without referring to the specific instance but rather as standalone variables leading to a syntax error.

## Strategy for fixing the bug:
To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the function is correctly defined within a class and adjust the attribute assignments to refer to the instance using `self`.

## Corrected version of the function:
```python
# The corrected version of the function

class Worker:
    def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
        self.id = worker_id
        self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
        self.last_active = last_active  # seconds since epoch
        self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        self.tasks = set()  # task objects
        self.info = {}
```
