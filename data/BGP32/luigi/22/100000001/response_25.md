The potential issue in the given buggy function is that the `__init__` method is not properly defined within a class, which can cause errors when trying to instantiate an object using this function.

To fix this bug, we need to encapsulate the `__init__` method within a class definition. Here is a corrected version of the function:

```python
import time

class Worker:
    def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
        self.id = worker_id
        self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world (currently a dict containing just the host)
        self.last_active = last_active  # seconds since epoch
        self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        self.tasks = set()  # task objects
        self.info = {}
```

In this corrected version, the `__init__` method is encapsulated within a class named `Worker`. This class can now be instantiated to create worker objects.
