The bug in the provided function `__init__` is that it seems to be missing the class definition where this function should belong. Typically, the `__init__` function is part of a class definition in Python.

Given the function signature `def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None)`, it is expected to be a constructor method of a class. However, the class definition is missing from the provided code snippet.

To fix this bug, we need to create a class with the provided attributes and the `__init__` method within it. Here is the corrected version:

```python
import time

class Worker:
    def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
        self.id = worker_id
        self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
        self.last_active = last_active  # seconds since epoch
        self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        self.tasks = set()  # task objects
        self.info = {}

# Create an instance of the Worker class
worker_instance = Worker(worker_id='12345')
```

In the corrected version, we defined a class called `Worker` with the provided attributes and initialized them in the `__init__` method of the class. Finally, we created an instance of the `Worker` class to demonstrate the corrected usage.
