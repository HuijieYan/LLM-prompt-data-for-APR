The buggy function `__init__` is missing the class declaration and constructor signature. It seems like it should belong to a class, but it's defined as a standalone function.

### Correction Steps:
1. Define a class surrounding the `__init__` function.
2. Add the `self` parameter to the `__init__` function for proper instantiation.
3. Make sure that the worker_id argument is passed when creating an instance of the class.
4. Import the `time` module before using `time.time()`.

### Corrected Version:
```python
import time

class Worker:
    def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
        self.id = worker_id
        self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
        self.last_active = last_active  # seconds since epoch
        self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        self.tasks = set()  # task objects
        self.info = {}
```

By fixing the above issues, the `__init__` function is now properly encapsulated within a class and can be used to instantiate `Worker` objects with the required attributes.
