The issue in the provided function is that the `__init__` method is missing the `self` parameter in its definition. The `self` parameter is necessary to access instance variables within the class.

To fix this bug:
1. Add the `self` parameter to the `__init__` method.
2. Correct the assignment of the `last_active` attribute by checking if it is provided, and if not, initializing it to `None`.
3. Since the function uses the `time` module, ensure that the necessary import statement is included in the script.

Here is the corrected version of the function:
```python
import time

class Worker:
    def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
        self.id = worker_id
        self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
        self.last_active = last_active if last_active is not None else None  # seconds since epoch
        self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        self.tasks = set()  # task objects
        self.info = {}
```

In this corrected version:
- The `self` parameter is added to the `__init__` method.
- The `last_active` attribute is correctly initialized based on the provided value or `None` if not provided.
