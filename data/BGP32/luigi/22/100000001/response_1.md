### Analysis:
The `__init__` function provided seems to be a constructor for a class, and it is missing the `self` parameter in its signature. This function initializes various attributes of the class, but the way it's defined could lead to errors due to missing `self` references.

### Identified Potential Error Locations:
1. The function `__init__` is missing `self` as the first parameter.
2. The usage of `time.time()` without the necessary import of the `time` module.

### Cause of the Bug:
The bug in the code is due to missing the `self` parameter in the `__init__` method. Without a proper instance reference (i.e., `self`), the attributes of the class may not be set correctly. Additionally, the `time` module needs to be imported before using `time.time()`.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
1. Add the `self` parameter as the first parameter in the `__init__` method.
2. Import the `time` module at the beginning of the script to use `time.time()`.

### Corrected Version:
```python
import time

class Scheduler:
    def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
        self.id = worker_id
        self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
        self.last_active = last_active  # seconds since epoch
        self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        self.tasks = set()  # task objects
        self.info = {}
```

With these corrections, the `__init__` method will now properly initialize the attributes within the class `Scheduler`.
