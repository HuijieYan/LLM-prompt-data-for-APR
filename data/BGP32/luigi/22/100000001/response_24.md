## Analysis of the buggy function

- The `__init__` function is supposed to initialize the attributes of the `Worker` class.
- It takes two parameters: `worker_id` and `last_active`.
- The issue with the current implementation is that the `__init__` method is defined without the class definition. It should be inside the `Worker` class.
- The `time` module is imported correctly, so there should not be any issue with using `time.time()`.

## Bug in the code

The bug in the code is that the `__init__` method is defined as a standalone function outside of a class. This will result in a `NameError` when trying to access attributes using `self`.

## Fixing the bug

To fix the bug, we need to define the `Worker` class and then move the `__init__` method inside the class definition.

## Corrected version of the function
Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
# The corrected version of the function

import time

class Worker:
    def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
        self.id = worker_id
        self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
        self.last_active = last_active  # seconds since epoch
        self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        self.tasks = set()  # task objects
        self.info = {}
```

By defining the `Worker` class and moving the `__init__` method inside it, the `id`, `reference`, `last_active`, `started`, `tasks`, and `info` attributes can be properly initialized without any issues.
