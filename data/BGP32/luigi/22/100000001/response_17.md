## Analysis:
1. The `__init__` function is missing the `self` parameter in the buggy code, which will cause an error when trying to initialize an instance of the class.
2. There is no class definition provided in the code snippet, so we assume that this `__init__` function is part of a class but is missing the class definition.

## Bug cause:
The buggy function lacks the `self` parameter, which is necessary for instance methods in Python. Without the `self` parameter, the function cannot access or modify the instance attributes of the class, leading to potential errors during initialization.

## Bug fix:
Add the `self` parameter to the `__init__` function so that it becomes an instance method of a class. 
Provide a class definition for the function to be within a class context.

## Corrected version:
Here is the corrected version of the code snippet:
```python
import time

# Assuming this function belongs to a class named Worker
class Worker:
    def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
        self.id = worker_id
        self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
        self.last_active = last_active  # seconds since epoch
        self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        self.tasks = set()  # task objects
        self.info = {}

# Create an instance of the Worker class
worker = Worker('unique_id')
```
