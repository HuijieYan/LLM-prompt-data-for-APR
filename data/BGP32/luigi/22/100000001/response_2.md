The issue in the provided function is that it is missing the class definition. The function seems like it belongs to a class, but it is not defined as a method within a class. This is resulting in a syntax error when trying to define the attributes of the class.

### Correction:

```python
# The corrected version of the function

class Scheduler:
    def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
        self.id = worker_id
        self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
        self.last_active = last_active  # seconds since epoch
        self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        self.tasks = set()  # task objects
        self.info = {}
```

### Explanation:

The reason for the bug in the original code is that the `__init__` function is supposed to be a method within a class. In Python, class methods need to be defined within the scope of a class. Without the correct class definition, the attributes mentioned in the function cannot be associated with an instance of a class.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:

To fix this bug, the `__init__` function needs to be defined within a class. By creating a class named `Scheduler` and placing the `__init__` method inside it, we can properly initialize the attributes of the class instance. This approach ensures that the attributes are associated with the class instance and can be accessed and manipulated as intended.
