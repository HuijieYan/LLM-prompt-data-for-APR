## Analysis:
The buggy function is an `__init__` constructor method of a class. The function is meant to initialize various attributes of an object when it is created. However, there is a bug in the function due to a missing `self` parameter in the method signature.

## Potential Error Locations:
1. The missing `self` parameter in the `__init__` method signature.
2. Incorrect assignment to `self.id` might lead to issues.

## Cause of the Bug:
The bug occurs because the `self` parameter is missing from the `__init__` method, so the attributes are not being assigned correctly to the instance of the class.

## Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to add the `self` parameter to the `__init__` method signature so that the attributes are assigned correctly to the instance of the class.

## Corrected Version:
```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: luigi/scheduler.py

class Worker:
    def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
        self.id = worker_id
        self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
        self.last_active = last_active  # seconds since epoch
        self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        self.tasks = set()  # task objects
        self.info = {}
```

In the corrected version, the `__init__` method now includes the `self` parameter in the method signature, allowing the attributes to be correctly assigned to the instance of the `Worker` class.
