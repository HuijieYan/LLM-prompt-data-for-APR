## Analysis:
The buggy function is a constructor (__init__) for a class in Python. The function initializes various attributes of the class instance. The potential error locations in the buggy function could be the parameter `last_active` being set to a mutable type (default parameter). This can lead to unexpected behavior as the default value will be shared across instances. 

## Error Cause:
The bug in the given function stems from setting a mutable default parameter (`None`) for the `last_active` variable. In Python, mutable default parameters are shared across instances, potentially leading to unintended consequences when altering the shared default object.

## Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
A common strategy to fix this bug is to set the default value of `last_active` to `None` and then assign it a value within the function only if it was not provided during the instance initialization.

## Corrected Version:
```python
# The corrected version of the function
def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
    self.id = worker_id
    self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
    
    if last_active is None:
        self.last_active = None
    else:
        self.last_active = last_active  # seconds since epoch
    
    self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
    self.tasks = set()  # task objects
    self.info = {}
```
