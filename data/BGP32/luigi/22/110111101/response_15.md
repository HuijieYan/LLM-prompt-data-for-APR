The bug in the provided `Worker` class implementation is that the `last_active` parameter in the `__init__` method is defaulting to `None`, but later in the `prune` method of the `Worker` class, it tries to compare `None` to an integer value which causes a `TypeError`.

To fix this bug, we should initialize `last_active` to the current time (in seconds since epoch) if it is not provided when creating a new `Worker` instance.

Here is the corrected version of the `Worker` class:

```python
class Worker(object):
    """
    Structure for tracking worker activity and keeping their references.
    """

    def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
        self.id = worker_id
        self.reference = None
        self.last_active = last_active if last_active is not None else time.time()
        self.started = time.time()
        self.tasks = set()
        self.info = {}
```

By updating the `__init__` method as shown above, the `last_active` attribute will default to the current time if not provided, which resolves the `TypeError` issue when comparing it in the `prune` method.

This corrected version should now pass the failing test case provided.
