The bug in the provided code is due to the `last_active` parameter being set to `None` by default in the `__init__` function of the `Worker` class. Then, when trying to add `config.worker_disconnect_delay` to `self.last_active`, an unsupported operand error occurs because `None` cannot be added to an integer.

To fix this bug, we can modify the `__init__` function to set `last_active` to the current time if it is not provided during object creation.

Here is a corrected version of the `Worker` class with the fixed `__init__` function:

```python
import time

class Worker(object):
    """
    Structure for tracking worker activity and keeping their references.
    """

    def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
        self.id = worker_id
        self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
        if last_active is None:
            self.last_active = time.time()  # if last active is not provided, set it to the current time
        else:
            self.last_active = last_active
        self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        self.tasks = set()  # task objects
        self.info = {}
```

With this correction, the `last_active` parameter will default to the current time if not provided, preventing the unsupported operand error when trying to add `config.worker_disconnect_delay` to it. The corrected version should pass the failing test and satisfy the expected input/output values.
