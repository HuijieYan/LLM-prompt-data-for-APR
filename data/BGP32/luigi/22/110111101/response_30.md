To fix the bug in the `__init__` function of the `Worker` class, we need to ensure that `last_active` is initialized with the provided value if it is not `None` in the constructor. The error occurred because `last_active` wasn't being set properly to a timestamp value when the Worker instance was created.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: luigi/scheduler.py

# The declaration of the class containing the buggy function
class Worker(object):
    """
    Structure for tracking worker activity and keeping their references.
    """

    def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
        self.id = worker_id
        self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
        self.last_active = last_active if last_active is not None else time.time()  # initialize with current time if last_active is None
        self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        self.tasks = set()  # task objects
        self.info = {}
```

By initializing `self.last_active` with `time.time()` if `last_active` is not provided in the constructor, we ensure that the variable is always set to a timestamp value, fixing the TypeError when comparing it with an integer in the `prune` method.

This corrected version should pass the failing test and provide the expected input/output values.
