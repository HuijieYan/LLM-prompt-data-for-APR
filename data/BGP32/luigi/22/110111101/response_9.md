The bug in the `__init__` method of the `Worker` class is that the `last_active` parameter is set to `None` initially, causing an issue when trying to add it to an integer. To fix this bug, we need to ensure that `last_active` is set to a default value if no value is provided during initialization.

Here's the corrected version of the `__init__` method:

```python
def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
    self.id = worker_id
    self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
    self.last_active = last_active if last_active is not None else time.time()  # seconds since epoch
    self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
    self.tasks = set()  # task objects
    self.info = {}
```

By making this change, the `last_active` parameter will default to the current time if no value is provided, addressing the issue highlighted in the failing test.
