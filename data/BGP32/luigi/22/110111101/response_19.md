The bug in the provided code is due to the `last_active` variable being set to `None` by default, causing a `TypeError` when trying to perform addition operation with `time.time()` in the `prune` function.

To fix this bug, we need to ensure that if `last_active` is not provided during initialization, it should default to the current time using `time.time()`.

Here is the corrected version of the `Worker` class with the fix:
```python
class Worker(object):
    """
    Structure for tracking worker activity and keeping their references.
    """

    def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
        self.id = worker_id
        self.reference = None
        self.last_active = last_active if last_active is not None else time.time()  # Default to current time if last_active is None
        self.started = time.time()
        self.tasks = set()
        self.info = {}
        
    def prune(self, config):
        if self.last_active + config.worker_disconnect_delay < time.time():
            pass  # Add your logic for pruning workers here
```

With this correction, the `Worker` class will now initialize the `last_active` attribute to the current time if it was not provided during instantiation, avoiding the `TypeError` seen in the failing test. This should make the test `test_worker_prune_after_init` pass as expected.
