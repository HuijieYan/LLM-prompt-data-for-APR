The bug in the provided code stems from the `last_active` parameter having a default value of `None` in the `__init__` function of the `Worker` class. This causes an issue when trying to calculate `self.last_active + config.worker_disconnect_delay` in the `prune` method as `None` cannot be added to an integer.

To fix this issue, we need to ensure that if `last_active` is not provided during the initialization of a `Worker` instance, it should default to `time.time()` to match the behavior of other time-related variables.

Here is the corrected version of the `__init__` function:
```python
class Worker(object):
    """
    Structure for tracking worker activity and keeping their references.
    """

    def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
        self.id = worker_id
        self.reference = None
        self.last_active = last_active if last_active is not None else time.time()
        self.started = time.time()
        self.tasks = set()
        self.info = {}
```

With this modification, the `last_active` parameter will default to the current time if not explicitly provided, ensuring that the calculations in the `prune` method work correctly.

By applying this fix, the `Worker` class should now behave as expected and pass the failing test case.
