The bug in the `Worker` class is related to the initialization of the `last_active` attribute. In the current implementation, it is set to `None` by default, which causes the error when trying to calculate the time difference in the `prune` method. To fix this issue, we need to modify the initialization of the `last_active` attribute in the `__init__` method to a default value that can be used in the time calculation later on.

Here is the corrected version of the `Worker` class:

```python
class Worker(object):
    """
    Structure for tracking worker activity and keeping their references.
    """

    def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
        self.id = worker_id
        self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
        self.last_active = last_active if last_active is not None else time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        self.tasks = set()  # task objects
        self.info = {}

    def prune(self, config):
        # Delete workers that haven't said anything for a while (probably killed)
        if self.last_active + config.worker_disconnect_delay < time.time():
            print("Worker {} pruned".format(self.id))
```

By setting `last_active` to the current time if it is `None`, we ensure that the time comparison in the `prune` method will work correctly.

This corrected version should resolve the TypeError issue during the failing test execution.
