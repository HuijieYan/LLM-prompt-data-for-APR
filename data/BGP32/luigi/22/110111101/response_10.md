To fix the bug in the `Worker` class, we need to ensure that the `last_active` attribute is properly initialized if no value is provided during object creation. The issue arises from trying to perform addition with a `None` value for `last_active`, resulting in a `TypeError`.

Here is the corrected version of the `Worker` class:

```python
class Worker(object):
    """
    Structure for tracking worker activity and keeping their references.
    """

    def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
        self.id = worker_id
        self.reference = None
        self.last_active = last_active if last_active is not None else time.time()  # Initialize last_active with current time if not provided
        self.started = time.time()
        self.tasks = set()
        self.info = {}
```

By checking if `last_active` is `None` during initialization, we set it to the current time using `time.time()` if no value is provided.

With this correction, the `Worker` class will now properly handle the initialization of `last_active` and avoid the `TypeError` that was occurring in the failing test.
