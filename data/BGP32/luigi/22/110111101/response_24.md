The issue in the provided buggy function arises from the fact that the `last_active` parameter in the `__init__` constructor of the `Worker` class is set to `None` by default. Later in the code, an attempt is made to compare this `None` type with an integer value in the `prune` method.

To fix this bug, we need to ensure that when `last_active` is not provided as an argument during the initialization of a `Worker` instance, it defaults to the current time using `time.time()`.

Here is the corrected version of the `__init__` method in the `Worker` class:

```python
class Worker(object):
    """
    Structure for tracking worker activity and keeping their references.
    """

    def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
        self.id = worker_id
        self.reference = None
        self.last_active = last_active if last_active is not None else time.time()
        self.started = time.time()
        self.tasks = set()
        self.info = {}
```

With this correction, the `last_active` parameter defaults to the current time if not explicitly specified, ensuring that the comparison in the `prune` method will work correctly.

By making this change, the `test_worker_prune_after_init` test case should now pass successfully.
