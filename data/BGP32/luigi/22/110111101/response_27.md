To fix the bug in the `__init__` method of the `Worker` class, we need to address the issue where `last_active` is defaulting to `None` and causing a `TypeError` when adding it to an integer value in the `prune` method.

Here's a corrected version of the `__init__` method:

```python
# The declaration of the class containing the corrected function
class Worker(object):
    """
    Structure for tracking worker activity and keeping their references.
    """

    # Corrected __init__ method
    def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
        self.id = worker_id
        self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
        self.last_active = last_active if last_active is not None else time.time()  # seconds since epoch or current time
        self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        self.tasks = set()  # task objects
        self.info = {}

```

Explanation:
- I modified the `last_active` assignment in the `__init__` method to use the provided value if it is not `None`, otherwise default to the current time using `time.time()`. This change ensures that `last_active` is always initialized with a valid timestamp.

By making this correction, the `worker.prune` function should now correctly handle the `last_active` timestamp without causing a `TypeError`. This corrected version aligns with the expected input/output values provided.
