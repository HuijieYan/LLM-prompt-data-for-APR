To fix the bug in the `Worker` class `__init__` function, we need to ensure that `last_active` is correctly initialized. The error occurs because `last_active` is set to `None` by default and is used in a calculation without being checked. We should initialize `last_active` to the current time if it is not provided.

Here is the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
import time

class Worker(object):
    """
    Structure for tracking worker activity and keeping their references.
    """
    
    def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
        self.id = worker_id
        self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
        if last_active is None:
            self.last_active = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        else:
            self.last_active = last_active
        self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        self.tasks = set()  # task objects
        self.info = {}

    def prune(self, config):
        # Delete workers that haven't said anything for a while (probably killed)
        if self.last_active + config.worker_disconnect_delay < time.time():
            pass  # Add the prune logic here
```

With this correction, the `last_active` is initialized to the current time if it is not provided. This will prevent the `TypeError` that was occurring when trying to add `None` and an integer.

This corrected version should now pass the failing test case provided.
