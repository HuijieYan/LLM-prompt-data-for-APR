The bug in the provided function is that the `last_active` parameter can be passed as `None`, but the code is not handling this case correctly when trying to perform addition with `None` and an integer. To fix this bug, we can modify the initialization of `self.last_active` to check if it is `None` and assign a default value in that case.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
class Worker(object):
    """
    Structure for tracking worker activity and keeping their references.
    """

    def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
        self.id = worker_id
        self.reference = None
        self.last_active = last_active if last_active is not None else time.time()
        self.started = time.time()
        self.tasks = set()
        self.info = {}
```

This modification ensures that if `last_active` is `None`, it will default to the current time. This change prevents the `TypeError` when trying to add `None` to an integer.

With this correction, the function should now pass the failing test case provided.
