## Explanation:
The error occurs because the `last_active` parameter is allowed to be `None` in the `__init__` method of the `Worker` class, and then the `prune` method tries to perform arithmetic operations on it. This results in a `TypeError` since `None + int` is not a supported operation.

## Fix:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that if `last_active` is not provided during initialization, it should default to the current time (`time.time()`).

## Corrected code:
```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: luigi/scheduler.py

class Worker(object):
    """
    Structure for tracking worker activity and keeping their references.
    """

    def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
        self.id = worker_id
        self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
        self.last_active = last_active if last_active is not None else time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        self.tasks = set()  # task objects
        self.info = {}
```

By setting `self.last_active = last_active if last_active is not None else time.time()` in the `__init__` method, we ensure that if `last_active` is not provided, it defaults to the current time when the `Worker` instance is created. This modification fixes the bug by guaranteeing that `last_active` will always have a valid value for arithmetic operations in the `prune` method.
