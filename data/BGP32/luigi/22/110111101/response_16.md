## Bug Explanation

The bug occurs because the `last_active` parameter in the `__init__` function of the `Worker` class is set to `None` by default. When `prune()` method is called on the worker object, it tries to perform an arithmetic operation where it adds `config.worker_disconnect_delay` (an integer) to `self.last_active` (which is `None` by default). This causes a `TypeError` because you can't add an integer to `None`.

## Fix Strategy

To fix this bug, you need to initialize `self.last_active` with the current time if no value is provided in the `__init__` function. This way, `self.last_active` will be set to a valid timestamp that can be used in subsequent calculations.

## The corrected version of the buggy function

```python
class Worker(object):
    """
    Structure for tracking worker activity and keeping their references.
    """
    
    def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
        self.id = worker_id
        self.reference = None
        self.last_active = last_active if last_active is not None else time.time()  # Initialize with current time if None
        self.started = time.time()
        self.tasks = set()
        self.info = {}

    def prune(self, config):
        if self.last_active + config.worker_disconnect_delay < time.time():
            # Perform pruning logic here
            pass
```

By initializing `self.last_active` with the current time if no value is provided, we ensure that it always holds a valid timestamp. This corrected version should pass the failing test and satisfy the expected input/output values.
