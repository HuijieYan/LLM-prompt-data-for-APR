The bug in the provided `Worker` class lies in the `__init__` method where the `last_active` parameter is set to `None` by default, leading to a `NoneType` error when it's involved in arithmetic operations.

To fix this bug, we need to handle the case where `last_active` is not provided and set it to the current time in seconds since epoch in that scenario.

Here is the corrected version of the `Worker` class:

```python
class Worker(object):
    """
    Structure for tracking worker activity and keeping their references.
    """

    def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
        self.id = worker_id
        self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
        self.last_active = last_active if last_active is not None else time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        self.tasks = set()  # task objects
        self.info = {}
```

By modifying the initialization of `last_active` to conditionally set it to the current time if no value is provided, this ensures that the `last_active` attribute always holds a valid value for arithmetic operations.

This correction should resolve the `TypeError: unsupported operand type(s) for +: 'NoneType' and 'int'` issue in the failing test case.
