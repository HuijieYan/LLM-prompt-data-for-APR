The issue in the buggy function is that the `last_active` parameter is being set as `None`, causing a `TypeError` when trying to add it to an integer in the `prune` method.

To fix this issue, we need to ensure that `last_active` is set to the correct value when it is passed as an argument or set to a default value if no value is provided.

Here is the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
class Worker(object):
    """
    Structure for tracking worker activity and keeping their references.
    """

    def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
        self.id = worker_id
        self.reference = None
        self.last_active = last_active if last_active is not None else time.time()
        self.started = time.time()
        self.tasks = set()
        self.info = {}
```

By adding a conditional statement to check if the `last_active` parameter is `None`, we set it to the current time using `time.time()` to avoid the `TypeError` in the `prune` method.

This correction should resolve the issue and make the failing test pass successfully.
