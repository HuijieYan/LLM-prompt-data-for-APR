The bug in the provided `Worker` class is due to the `last_active` parameter in the `__init__` function being assigned a default value of `None`. When checking for pruning in the `prune` function, the code tries to add a `NoneType` with an `int`, resulting in the `TypeError` seen in the failing test.

To fix this bug, we need to ensure that `last_active` is correctly initialized to a valid timestamp instead of None. We can achieve this by modifying the `__init__` function to set `last_active` to the current time when no value is provided.

Here is the corrected version of the `Worker` class:

```python
class Worker(object):
    """
    Structure for tracking worker activity and keeping their references.
    """

    def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
        self.id = worker_id
        self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
        self.last_active = last_active if last_active is not None else time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        self.tasks = set()  # task objects
        self.info = {}
```

With this modification, the `last_active` parameter is set to the current timestamp if no value is provided, avoiding the `TypeError` during pruning.

This corrected version of the `Worker` class should pass the failing test and satisfy the expected input/output values.
