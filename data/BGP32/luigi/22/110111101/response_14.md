The issue in the buggy function is that it tries to add a `NoneType` (the default value of `last_active` when not provided) with an `int`, resulting in a `TypeError`. To fix this bug, we need to handle the case where `last_active` is None and assign a default value instead.

Here is the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
class Worker(object):
    """
    Structure for tracking worker activity and keeping their references.
    """

    def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
        self.id = worker_id
        self.reference = None
        self.last_active = last_active if last_active is not None else time.time()  # Assign time if last_active is None
        self.started = time.time()
        self.tasks = set()
        self.info = {}
```

With this correction, the `last_active` parameter will default to the current time if not provided, preventing the `TypeError` that occurred in the failing test case. The corrected function should now pass the failing test.
