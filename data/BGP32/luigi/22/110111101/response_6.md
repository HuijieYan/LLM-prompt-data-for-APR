## Bug Explanation
In the buggy `__init__` function of the `Worker` class, the `last_active` parameter has a default value of `None`. Later in the function, the `last_active` value is used in a comparison operation along with `config.worker_disconnect_delay`, which results in a `TypeError` because `None` cannot be used in arithmetic operations.

## Bug Fix Strategy
To fix this bug, we need to handle the case where `last_active` is `None` before using it in the comparison. We can set a default value for `last_active` that corresponds to the current time if no value is provided. This way, we ensure that `last_active` always has a valid value for comparison.

## The corrected version of the buggy function
```python
class Worker(object):
    """
    Structure for tracking worker activity and keeping their references.
    """

    def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
        self.id = worker_id
        self.reference = None
        self.last_active = last_active if last_active is not None else time.time()
        self.started = time.time()
        self.tasks = set()
        self.info = {}
```

By modifying the conditional assignment for `last_active`, we ensure that it defaults to the current time if no value is provided. This way, we avoid the `TypeError` when comparing `last_active` with `config.worker_disconnect_delay`.
