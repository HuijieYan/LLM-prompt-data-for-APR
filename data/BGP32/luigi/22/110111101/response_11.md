To fix the bug in the `Worker` class `__init__` method, we need to ensure that if `last_active` is not provided during initialization, it defaults to the current time using `time.time()`.

Here is the corrected version of the `__init__` method:

```python
class Worker(object):
    def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
        self.id = worker_id
        self.reference = None
        self.last_active = last_active if last_active is not None else time.time()
        self.started = time.time()
        self.tasks = set()
        self.info = {}
```

By modifying the initialization logic to check if `last_active` is `None`, we ensure that it defaults to the current time when no explicit value is provided.

This corrected version aligns with the expected values and types of variables outlined in the failing test execution. It solves the TypeError issue by ensuring that `last_active` is always a valid float value.
