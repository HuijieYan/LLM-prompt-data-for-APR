## Fixing the Bug

### Bug Analysis
The error occurs in the `prune` method of the `Worker` class when trying to add `self.last_active` (which could be `None`) and `config.worker_disconnect_delay` (an integer). This results in a `TypeError` due to unsupported operand types being used in the addition operation.

### Bug Cause
The `last_active` attribute of the `Worker` class is set as `None` by default in the `__init__` method. When trying to perform arithmetic operations such as addition with `None`, it results in a `TypeError`. 

### Fix Strategy
To fix this bug, we should initialize `last_active` with the default value of `time.time()` (seconds since epoch) if it is provided as `None` during the initialization. This way, we ensure that `last_active` is always a numeric value that can be used in arithmetic operations.

### Corrected Version of the `__init__` method

```python
def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
    self.id = worker_id
    self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
    self.last_active = last_active if last_active is not None else time.time()  # ensure last_active is numeric
    self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
    self.tasks = set()  # task objects
    self.info = {}
```

By initializing `last_active` with the current time if it is `None`, we ensure that arithmetic operations involving `last_active` will not encounter a `TypeError`. The corrected version should now pass the failing test.
