The bug in the provided code is due to the `last_active` parameter having a default value of `None` and then being used in a calculation without proper handling. This results in a `TypeError` when trying to add `None` with an integer.

To fix this bug, we need to ensure that `last_active` is properly initialized to a float value if it is not provided during the initialization of the `Worker` class.

Here is the corrected version of the `__init__` function:

```python
class Worker(object):
    """
    Structure for tracking worker activity and keeping their references.
    """

    def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
        self.id = worker_id
        self.reference = None
        self.last_active = last_active if last_active else time.time()  # Initialize to current time if not provided
        self.started = time.time()
        self.tasks = set()
        self.info = {}
```

By checking if `last_active` is provided during initialization and assigning the current time if not, we ensure that the `last_active` will always be a valid float value.

This correction should address the `TypeError` issue identified in the failing test case, and ensure that the expected input/output values are met.
