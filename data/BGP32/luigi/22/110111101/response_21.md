Based on the analysis of the buggy function and the failing test, the issue arises from the `last_active` parameter being set to `None` initially, leading to a `TypeError` when trying to add an integer to `None` in the `prune` method.

To fix this bug, we need to initialize the `last_active` parameter to the current time if it is not provided during the initialization of the `Worker` object.

Here is the corrected version of the `Worker` class:

```python
import time

class Worker(object):
    """
    Structure for tracking worker activity and keeping their references.
    """

    def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
        self.id = worker_id
        self.reference = None
        self.last_active = last_active if last_active is not None else time.time()
        self.started = time.time()
        self.tasks = set()
        self.info = {}

    def prune(self, config):
        if self.last_active + config.worker_disconnect_delay < time.time():
            # Perform pruning logic here
            pass
```

By initializing `self.last_active` to the current time if it is provided as `None`, we ensure that the addition operation in the `prune` method is valid, resolving the `TypeError` issue. This corrected version should pass the failing test and satisfy the expected input/output values.
