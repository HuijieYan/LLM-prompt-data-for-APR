To fix the bug in the `Worker` class, we need to ensure that the `last_active` attribute is initialized properly in the `__init__` method. Currently, the `last_active` attribute is set to `None`, causing the TypeError when trying to add it to an integer in the `prune` method.

Here is the corrected version of the `Worker` class:

```python
class Worker(object):
    """
    Structure for tracking worker activity and keeping their references.
    """

    def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
        self.id = worker_id
        self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
        self.last_active = last_active if last_active is not None else time.time()  # seconds since epoch or current time
        self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        self.tasks = set()  # task objects
        self.info = {}

    def prune(self, config):
        # Delete workers that haven't said anything for a while (probably killed)
        if self.last_active + config.worker_disconnect_delay < time.time():
            # Prune worker
            pass  # Replace this with your prune logic
```

With this correction, the `last_active` attribute is initialized to the current time using `time.time()` if no value is provided during the creation of a `Worker` object.

By making this change, the `prune` method will be able to calculate the time properly and avoid the TypeError that was occurring before. This fix will ensure that the `Worker` class behaves as expected and passes the failing test case.
