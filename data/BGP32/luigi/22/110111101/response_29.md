The issue in the buggy function is with the initialization of the `last_active` parameter when it is set to `None`. This causes a `TypeError` when trying to add `config.worker_disconnect_delay` which is an integer to `None`. To fix this, we need to handle the case where `last_active` is `None` and set it to the current time in that scenario.

Here is the corrected version of the `Worker` class with the fixed `__init__` method:

```python
import time

class Worker(object):
    """
    Structure for tracking worker activity and keeping their references.
    """

    def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
        self.id = worker_id
        self.reference = None  
        
        if last_active is None:
            self.last_active = time.time()
        else:
            self.last_active = last_active
        
        self.started = time.time()  
        self.tasks = set()  
        self.info = {}

    def prune(self, config):
        if self.last_active + config.worker_disconnect_delay < time.time():
            # Do something here based on the condition for pruning
            pass
```

By explicitly checking if `last_active` is `None` in the constructor and initializing it to `time.time()` if needed, we prevent the `TypeError` when the `prune` method is called in the test case.

This corrected version should pass the failing test case with the expected input/output values provided.
