The issue in the buggy function is that the `last_active` parameter in the `__init__` method is set to `None`. Later in the `prune` method, an attempt is made to add `config.worker_disconnect_delay` to `self.last_active`, which causes a `TypeError`.

To fix this bug, we need to handle the case where `last_active` is `None` in the `__init__` method by providing a default value of `time.time()` if `last_active` is not provided.

Here is the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
class Worker(object):
    """
    Structure for tracking worker activity and keeping their references.
    """

    def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
        self.id = worker_id
        self.reference = None
        self.last_active = last_active if last_active is not None else time.time()
        self.started = time.time()
        self.tasks = set()
        self.info = {}

    def prune(self, config):
        if self.last_active + config.worker_disconnect_delay < time.time():
            # Perform prune operations here based on the configuration provided
            pass
```

With this correction, the `__init__` method will assign the current time to `last_active` if it is not provided, ensuring that the `prune` method can be executed without raising a `TypeError`.
