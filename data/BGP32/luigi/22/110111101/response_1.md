The bug in the provided `Worker` class lies in the `__init__` function where `last_active` parameter is assigned directly without checking if it is `None` or not. This directly causes the `TypeError` when trying to add `NoneType` and `int`.

To fix this bug, we need to check if `last_active` is `None` and assign the appropriate default value accordingly.

Here is the corrected version of the `__init__` function:

```python
# The corrected version of the __init__ function
def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
    self.id = worker_id
    self.reference = None
    self.last_active = last_active if last_active is not None else time.time()  # Assigning default value if last_active is None
    self.started = time.time()
    self.tasks = set()
    self.info = {}
```

By including the check for `last_active` being `None`, we ensure that the assignment is done correctly, and there won't be any `TypeError` when comparing it with an integer value in the `prune` method.

This corrected version will pass the failing test and satisfy the expected input/output values.
