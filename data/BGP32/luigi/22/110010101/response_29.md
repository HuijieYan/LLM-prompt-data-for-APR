## Analysis
1. The `Worker` class has a buggy `__init__` function that initializes the class attributes.
2. The error message indicates a `TypeError` due to trying to perform addition between a `NoneType` and an `int`.
3. The bug is caused by the `last_active` parameter being possibly `None`, and when trying to add it to the `config.worker_disconnect_delay` (which is an `int`), it raises the `TypeError`.
4. The strategy to fix the bug is to check if `last_active` is `None` before performing the addition and handle it accordingly.
5. We need to modify the `__init__` function to handle the case where `last_active` is `None`.

## Corrected Version
```python
# The corrected version of the buggy function
class Worker(object):
    """
    Structure for tracking worker activity and keeping their references.
    """

    def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
        self.id = worker_id
        self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
        self.last_active = last_active if last_active is not None else time.time()  # seconds since epoch or current time
        self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        self.tasks = set()  # task objects
        self.info = {}
```

By checking if `last_active` is `None` and assigning the current time with `time.time()` if it is, we ensure that the operations involving `last_active` will not raise a `TypeError`.
