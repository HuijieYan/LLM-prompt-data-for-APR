The issue in the buggy function arises from the fact that the variable `last_active` is being set to `None` as a default value in the `__init__` function, but later on, there is an attempt to perform arithmetic operations on it as if it were a numeric value. This leads to a `TypeError` when trying to add `None` to an integer in the `prune` method.

To fix this issue, we need to handle the case where `last_active` is `None` and provide a default value that can be used in arithmetic operations. One way to address this is by checking if `last_active` is `None` before performing any calculations.

Here is the corrected version of the `__init__` method in the `Worker` class:

```python
def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
    self.id = worker_id
    self.reference = None
    self.last_active = last_active if last_active is not None else time.time()
    self.started = time.time()
    self.tasks = set()
    self.info = {}
```

With this correction, the `last_active` parameter is set to the current time if it is `None`, ensuring that it is always a valid numeric value for arithmetic operations.

Please ensure to update the `__init__` method in the `Worker` class with this corrected version.
