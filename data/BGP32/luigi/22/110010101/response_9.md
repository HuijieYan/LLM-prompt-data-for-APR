## Analysis
1. **Buggy Function**: The `__init__` function of the `Worker` class is the buggy function. It initializes various attributes of a worker object.
   
2. **Error Message**: The error message indicates a `TypeError` when trying to add `NoneType` and `int` in the line `if self.last_active + config.worker_disconnect_delay < time.time():`.
   
3. **Expected Input/Output**:
   - The `worker_id` is an integer and is correctly assigned to `self.id`.
   - The `last_active` is a `float` and should be assigned to `self.last_active`.
   - The other attributes should be initialized correctly as specified in the expected values and types.

## Bug Cause
The bug occurs because the `last_active` parameter in the `__init__` function is allowed to be None, which happens in the failing test case. When trying to add `None` and an integer in the `prune` method, a `TypeError` is raised.

## Bug Fix
To fix the bug, we should handle the case when `last_active` is None in the `__init__` function by assigning a default value that works correctly with the subsequent operations. In this case, we can set `last_active` to the current time if it is None.

## Corrected Code
```python
class Worker(object):
    """
    Structure for tracking worker activity and keeping their references.
    """

    def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
        self.id = worker_id
        self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
        self.last_active = last_active if last_active is not None else time.time()  # seconds since epoch or current time
        self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        self.tasks = set()  # task objects
        self.info = {}

    def prune(self, config):
        if self.last_active + config.worker_disconnect_delay < time.time():
            # perform pruning actions
            pass
``` 

Now the `last_active` parameter in the `__init__` function will default to the current time if None, avoiding the `TypeError` when used in the `prune` method. This corrected version should pass the failing test case.
