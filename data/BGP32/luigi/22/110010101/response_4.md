The bug in the provided function is due to the `self.last_active` variable being initialized with a default value of `None`, and then later used in a comparison where an integer value is expected. This results in a `TypeError` because `None` cannot be added to an integer.

To fix this bug, we need to ensure that `self.last_active` is set to an integer value if `last_active` is not provided during initialization. We can use the current timestamp in seconds since epoch as the default value for `self.last_active` in case `last_active` is `None`.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
import time

class Worker(object):
    """
    Structure for tracking worker activity and keeping their references.
    """

    def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
        self.id = worker_id
        self.reference = None
        self.last_active = last_active if last_active is not None else time.time()
        self.started = time.time()
        self.tasks = set()
        self.info = {}

    def prune(self, config):
        # Delete workers that haven't said anything for a while (probably killed)
        if self.last_active + config.worker_disconnect_delay < time.time():
            # Perform the pruning logic here
            pass
```

With this correction, the `self.last_active` variable is now initialized with the current timestamp if no value is provided, ensuring that it is always an integer. This will prevent the `TypeError` that was occurring in the failing test case.
