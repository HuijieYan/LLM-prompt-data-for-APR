## Analysis
1. The buggy function `__init__` of the `Worker` class initializes the `last_active` attribute with a default value of `None`. The error occurs in the `prune` method when trying to check if `self.last_active + config.worker_disconnect_delay < time.time()`. The error message states that it can't add `NoneType` to an `int`.
2. The bug is caused by the default value of `last_active` being set to `None` when the `Worker` object is created without specifying a value for it.
3. The bug causes a `TypeError` because `None` cannot be added with an integer value in the `prune` method. The expected behavior is to correctly compare the timestamps for pruning inactive workers.
4. To fix the bug, we need to handle the case where `last_active` is `None` in the `prune` method by skipping the comparison if it is `None`.
5. The corrected version of the code is provided below:

## Corrected code
```python
class Worker(object):
    """
    Structure for tracking worker activity and keeping their references.
    """

    def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
        self.id = worker_id
        self.reference = None
        self.last_active = last_active
        self.started = time.time()
        self.tasks = set()
        self.info = {}
        
    def prune(self, config):
        if self.last_active is not None and self.last_active + config.worker_disconnect_delay < time.time():
            # Perform pruning action if last_active is not None
            pass
``` 

By adding a check for `self.last_active is not None` before doing the comparison, we avoid the `TypeError` and ensure that the pruning logic only operates when `last_active` has a valid value.
