Based on the provided buggy function and the error message, the issue stems from the fact that the `last_active` parameter is initialized as `None`, and then later when trying to compare it with an integer in the `prune` function, it leads to a `TypeError` due to the unsupported operand types.

To fix this issue, we should update the `__init__` method to handle the case where `last_active` is `None` by assigning the current time when `last_active` is `None`.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
class Worker(object):
    """
    Structure for tracking worker activity and keeping their references.
    """

    def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
        self.id = worker_id
        self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
        self.last_active = last_active if last_active is not None else time.time()  # seconds since epoch or current time if last_active is None
        self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        self.tasks = set()  # task objects
        self.info = {}
    
    def prune(self, config):
        # Delete workers that haven't said anything for a while (probably killed)
        if self.last_active + config.worker_disconnect_delay < time.time():
            # do something in case of pruning
            pass
```

With this correction, the `last_active` parameter will default to the current time if not provided, preventing the `TypeError` observed during the test execution.
