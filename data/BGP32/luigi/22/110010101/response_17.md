## Analysis
1. The buggy function is the `__init__` method of the `Worker` class in the `luigi.scheduler` module.
2. The bug occurs when trying to add the `last_active` attribute to the `Worker` instance.
3. The error message is a `TypeError` indicating that the `+` operation is not supported between a `NoneType` and an `int`. This error occurs when trying to compare `self.last_active` (which can be `None`) with the current time.
4. To fix the bug, we need to ensure that if `last_active` is `None`, we initialize it with a suitable default value in the `__init__` method.
5. We should set a default value of `None` for the `last_active` parameter in the `__init__` method and handle the case where it is `None` when calculating the pruning time.

## Corrected code
```python
class Worker(object):
    """
    Structure for tracking worker activity and keeping their references.
    """

    def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
        self.id = worker_id
        self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
        self.last_active = last_active if last_active is not None else time.time()  # seconds since epoch or current time
        self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        self.tasks = set()  # task objects
        self.info = {}

    def prune(self, config):
        # Delete workers that haven't said anything for a while (probably killed)
        if self.last_active + config.worker_disconnect_delay < time.time():
            # Do the pruning
            pass
```

By setting a default value of `None` for `last_active` and handling it in the initialization process, we can prevent the `TypeError` when comparing it with the current time in the `prune` method.
