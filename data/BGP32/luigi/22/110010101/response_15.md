## Analysis
The error occurs because the `last_active` parameter is assigned a default value of `None` in the `__init__` function of the `Worker` class. When attempting to check `self.last_active + config.worker_disconnect_delay < time.time()`, a TypeError is raised due to the unsupported operation between `NoneType` and `int`.

## Fix
To fix the bug, we need to handle the case where `last_active` is `None` by assigning a default value that allows arithmetic operations to be performed. One common approach is to set `last_active` to the current time when it is not provided.

Here is the corrected version of the `__init__` function in the `Worker` class:

```python
class Worker(object):
    """
    Structure for tracking worker activity and keeping their references.
    """

    def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
        self.id = worker_id
        self.reference = None
        self.last_active = last_active if last_active is not None else time.time()  # Handle None case
        self.started = time.time()
        self.tasks = set()
        self.info = {}
```

With this correction, the `last_active` parameter in the `Worker` class will default to the current time if not explicitly provided.

This fix will ensure that the arithmetic operation in the `prune` method can be performed without raising a TypeError.
