## Analysis
1. The buggy function is the `__init__` method of the `Worker` class in the `luigi/scheduler.py` file.
2. The error occurs in the `prune` method when trying to compare `self.last_active` (which can be `None`) with an integer value.
3. The cause of the bug is that `self.last_active` is initialized as `None` in the `__init__` method, but the comparison in the `prune` method expects it to be a float representing seconds since epoch.
4. To fix the bug, we need to handle the case where `self.last_active` is `None` before attempting to perform comparisons with it.
5. A corrected version of the function is provided below, which sets `self.last_active` to the provided value if it is not `None`, or to the current time otherwise.

## Corrected Version
```python
class Worker(object):
    """
    Structure for tracking worker activity and keeping their references.
    """

    def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
        self.id = worker_id
        self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
        if last_active is not None:
            self.last_active = last_active  # seconds since epoch
        else:
            self.last_active = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        self.tasks = set()  # task objects
        self.info = {}
``` 

By updating the `__init__` method as shown above, we ensure that `self.last_active` is always assigned a valid value, either the provided `last_active` value or the current time in seconds since epoch. This correction should prevent the `TypeError` that was occurring during the test execution.
