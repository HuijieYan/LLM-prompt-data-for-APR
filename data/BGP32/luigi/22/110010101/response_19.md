## Solution

### Analysis
The error message indicates a `TypeError` due to adding `NoneType` and `int` data types in the `prune()` method. The issue lies in the `__init__` method where the `last_active` parameter defaults to `None`. When the `prune()` method tries to add `config.worker_disconnect_delay` to `self.last_active`, it causes the mentioned error due to the `None` value. 

### Bug Fixing Strategy
To fix this bug, we can check if `last_active` is `None` and assign a default value to it before performing the comparison in the `prune()` method.

### Updated Code

```python
class Worker(object):
    """
    Structure for tracking worker activity and keeping their references.
    """

    def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
        self.id = worker_id
        self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
        self.last_active = last_active if last_active is not None else time.time()  # seconds since epoch or current time if None
        self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        self.tasks = set()  # task objects
        self.info = {}

    def prune(self, config):
        # Delete workers that haven't said anything for a while (probably killed)
        if self.last_active + config.worker_disconnect_delay < time.time():
            # Prune logic here
            pass
```

With this fix, the code should now correctly handle cases where `last_active` is provided as `None`. This fix ensures that a default timestamp (current time) is assigned to `last_active` if the parameter is not provided during object creation.
