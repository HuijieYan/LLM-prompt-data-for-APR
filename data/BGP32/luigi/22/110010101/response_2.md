## Analysis
1. The error occurs in the `prune` method of the `Worker` class when trying to compare `self.last_active` (which can be `None`) with an integer value.
2. The cause of the bug is that when `last_active` is not provided during initialization, it defaults to `None`. Later in the `prune` method, this `None` value causes a `TypeError` when trying to add it to an integer value.
3. To fix the bug, we need to handle the case where `last_active` is `None` in the `prune` method.

## Bug Fix
Below is the corrected version of the `Worker` class with the fixed `prune` method:

```python
class Worker(object):
    """
    Structure for tracking worker activity and keeping their references.
    """

    def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
        self.id = worker_id
        self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
        self.last_active = last_active  # seconds since epoch
        self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        self.tasks = set()  # task objects
        self.info = {}

    def prune(self, config):
        if not self.last_active:
            return  # No need to prune if last_active is None
        if self.last_active + config.worker_disconnect_delay < time.time():
            # Prune the worker
            pass
```

By adding a check for `None` value in `prune` method, we avoid the `TypeError` and ensure that the worker is not pruned when `last_active` is `None`.
