The bug in the provided function is due to the `last_active` parameter being set to `None` by default in the `__init__` method, and the comparison `self.last_active + config.worker_disconnect_delay < time.time()` is causing a `TypeError` because you cannot add `NoneType` (None) with an integer (`config.worker_disconnect_delay`). 

To fix this bug:
- We need to initialize `self.last_active` with the current time (`time.time()`) if `last_active` is not provided during the initialization of the `Worker` instance.

Here is the corrected version of the `__init__` method of the `Worker` class:
```python
class Worker(object):
    """
    Structure for tracking worker activity and keeping their references.
    """

    def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
        self.id = worker_id
        self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
        if last_active is not None:
            self.last_active = last_active  # seconds since epoch
        else:
            self.last_active = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        self.tasks = set()  # task objects
        self.info = {}
```

With this correction, the `last_active` parameter in the `Worker` class initialization will default to the current time if no value is specified, avoiding the `TypeError` when comparing it with `config.worker_disconnect_delay`.
