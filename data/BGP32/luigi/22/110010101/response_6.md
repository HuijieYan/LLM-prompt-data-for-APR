## Analysis
1. The `__init__` method of the `Worker` class initializes attributes for a worker object. The `last_active` parameter is optional and defaults to `None`.
2. In the failing test `test_worker_prune_after_init`, an instance of `Worker` is created with `worker_id=123` but the `last_active` parameter is not provided, hence it defaults to `None`.
3. The failing line in the `prune` method tries to check if `self.last_active + config.worker_disconnect_delay < time.time()`. However, since `last_active` is `None`, adding it to an integer (`config.worker_disconnect_delay`) causes a `TypeError`.
4. To fix the bug, we need to handle the case where `last_active` is `None` in the `prune` method by checking if it's not `None` before performing arithmetic operations.

## Code Fix
```python
class Worker(object):
    """
    Structure for tracking worker activity and keeping their references.
    """

    def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
        self.id = worker_id
        self.reference = None
        self.last_active = last_active
        self.started = time.time()
        self.tasks = set()
        self.info = {}

    def prune(self, config):
        # Delete workers that haven't said anything for a while (probably killed)
        if self.last_active is not None and self.last_active + config.worker_disconnect_delay < time.time():
            # Perform the deletion or other actions here
            pass
```

By checking if `self.last_active` is not `None` before performing arithmetic operations, we avoid the `TypeError` caused by trying to add an integer to `None`. This fix ensures that the `prune` method works correctly even when `last_active` is not provided during initialization.
