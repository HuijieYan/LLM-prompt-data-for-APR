### Analysis
The buggy function is the `__init__` method of the `Worker` class. The bug occurs because the `last_active` parameter is set to `None` by default, but later in the code, there is an attempt to add an integer to it, which results in a `TypeError`.

### Bug Cause
The bug occurs because the `last_active` parameter is not always initialized with a valid value, causing it to be `None`, which cannot be added to an integer in the `prune` method.

### Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that `last_active` is initialized with a valid value if `None` is provided as the input. We can use the current time as the default `last_active` value if none is provided.

### Corrected Code
```python
import time

# The relative path of the corrected file: luigi/scheduler.py

# The declaration of the class containing the corrected function
class Worker(object):
    """
    Structure for tracking worker activity and keeping their references.
    """

    def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
        self.id = worker_id
        self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
        self.last_active = last_active if last_active is not None else time.time()  # seconds since epoch or current time
        self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        self.tasks = set()  # task objects
        self.info = {}

    def prune(self, config):
        # Delete workers that haven't said anything for a while (probably killed)
        if self.last_active + config.worker_disconnect_delay < time.time():
            pass  # Add the logic for pruning here
``` 

By modifying the `__init__` method to set the default value of `last_active` to the current time if it is `None`, we ensure that there won't be a `NoneType` error when adding an integer to it later in the code. Now, the corrected function should pass the failing test.
