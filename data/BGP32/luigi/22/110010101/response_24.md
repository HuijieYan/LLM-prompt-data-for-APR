The bug in the provided code is due to the `last_active` parameter being set to `None` by default in the `__init__` function of the `Worker` class. This causes a `TypeError` when trying to add `config.worker_disconnect_delay` to it in the `prune` method.

To fix this bug, we should initialize the `last_active` parameter to the current time (`time.time()`) if it is not provided during the instantiation of the `Worker` object.

Here is the corrected version of the code:

```python
class Worker(object):
    """
    Structure for tracking worker activity and keeping their references.
    """

    def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
        self.id = worker_id
        self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
        self.last_active = last_active if last_active is not None else time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        self.tasks = set()  # task objects
        self.info = {}

    def prune(self, config):
        # Delete workers that haven't said anything for a while (probably killed)
        if self.last_active + config.worker_disconnect_delay < time.time():
            # Perform pruning logic here
            pass
```

With this correction, the `last_active` parameter gets initialized to the current time if it is not specified when creating a `Worker` object, avoiding the `TypeError` that was occurring before.
