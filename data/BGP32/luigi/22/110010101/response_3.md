## Analysis
1. The `Worker` class has an `__init__` method that initializes various attributes of a worker object.
2. The error message indicates a `TypeError` due to trying to add `NoneType` and `int` in the `prune` method. This happens because `last_active` can be `None`, and the code does not handle this case properly.
3. The expected input parameters are `worker_id` as an integer, and `last_active` as a float. The expected output values are specified for each attribute.

## Bug Cause
The bug occurs because `last_active` can be `None` initially, and when trying to add `config.worker_disconnect_delay` to it in the `prune` method, a `TypeError` is raised due to unsupported operand types.

## Fix Strategy
We need to handle the case when `last_active` is `None` in the `prune` method by first checking if `last_active` is not `None` before performing the arithmetic operation.

## The corrected version of the code
```python
class Worker(object):
    """
    Structure for tracking worker activity and keeping their references.
    """

    def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
        self.id = worker_id
        self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
        self.last_active = last_active  # seconds since epoch
        self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        self.tasks = set()  # task objects
        self.info = {}

    def prune(self, config):
        # Delete workers that haven't said anything for a while (probably killed)
        if self.last_active is not None and self.last_active + config.worker_disconnect_delay < time.time():
            # Clean up tasks, etc.
            pass
```

By adding the check `if self.last_active is not None` before performing the arithmetic operation, we ensure that the code does not attempt to add `None` with an integer, fixing the `TypeError` issue.
