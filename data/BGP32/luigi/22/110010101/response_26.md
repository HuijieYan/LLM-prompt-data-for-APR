### Analysis
The bug occurs due to the `last_active` parameter being set to `None` by default in the `__init__` method but later being used in a calculation without checking for `None`. This causes a `TypeError` when trying to add an integer to a `NoneType` object.

### Bug Cause
The bug is caused by using `self.last_active` (which can be `None`) in an arithmetic operation without handling the case where `last_active` is `None`. 

### Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to handle the case where `self.last_active` is `None` before performing arithmetic operations. One way to handle this is by setting a default value for `last_active` in case it is `None`.

### The corrected version of the buggy function

```python
class Worker(object):
    """
    Structure for tracking worker activity and keeping their references.
    """

    def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
        self.id = worker_id
        self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
        self.last_active = last_active if last_active is not None else time.time()  # seconds since epoch or current time
        self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        self.tasks = set()  # task objects
        self.info = {}

    def prune(self, config):
        # Delete workers that haven't said anything for a while (probably killed)
        if self.last_active is not None and self.last_active + config.worker_disconnect_delay < time.time():
            # prune logic
            pass
``` 

With this corrected version, we check if `self.last_active` is not `None` before performing the arithmetic operation. If it is `None`, the current time is taken as the value to avoid the `TypeError` encountered previously.
