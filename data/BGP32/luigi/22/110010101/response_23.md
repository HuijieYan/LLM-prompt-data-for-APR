## Analysis
1. The `__init__` function of the `Worker` class initializes the attributes of a worker object, including `id`, `reference`, `last_active`, `started`, `tasks`, and `info`.
2. The error message indicates a `TypeError` when trying to add `NoneType` and `int` in the `prune` method because `last_active` is initialized as `None`.
3. The `last_active` attribute is expected to hold the time in seconds since epoch but is currently set to `None`, causing the error when trying to add the `worker_disconnect_delay`. The expected input/output values provide the correct initialization values for `last_active`.
4. To fix the bug, we need to ensure that `last_active` is initialized correctly with the provided timestamp value if no value is provided during object creation.
5. We will update the `__init__` method to handle the case where `last_active` is not provided, initializing it with the current time if it is `None`.

## Corrected Version
```python
class Worker(object):
    """
    Structure for tracking worker activity and keeping their references.
    """

    def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
        self.id = worker_id
        self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
        self.last_active = last_active if last_active is not None else time.time()  # seconds since epoch or current time
        self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        self.tasks = set()  # task objects
        self.info = {}

    def prune(self, config):
        # Delete workers that haven't said anything for a while (probably killed)
        if self.last_active + config.worker_disconnect_delay < time.time():
            # Perform pruning logic here
            pass
``` 

By updating the `__init__` method to handle the case where `last_active` is `None`, we ensure that the `last_active` attribute is correctly initialized based on the provided value or the current time. This change should fix the `TypeError` mentioned in the failing test.
