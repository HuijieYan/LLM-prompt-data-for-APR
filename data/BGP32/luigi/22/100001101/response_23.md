## Analysis
The buggy function is an `__init__` method for a class, which initializes several attributes of the class instance. The issue lies in the way the `last_active` parameter is assigned. The `last_active` parameter is intended to be the last active time of the worker, but the current implementation does not assign the given value correctly.

## Bug Explanation
In the buggy code, the `last_active` parameter is not being assigned to the class attribute `self.last_active`. This results in `self.last_active` being set to the default value of `None` instead of the actual value passed as the parameter.

## Fixing the Bug
To fix the bug, we need to correctly assign the `last_active` parameter to the `self.last_active` attribute within the `__init__` method.

## The corrected version of the function
```python
def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
    self.id = worker_id
    self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
    self.last_active = last_active  # seconds since epoch
    self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
    self.tasks = set()  # task objects
    self.info = {}
```
