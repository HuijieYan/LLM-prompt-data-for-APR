The issue in the provided function is that the `last_active` parameter is not being assigned correctly to the `self.last_active` attribute. The expected input value for `last_active` is not being considered in the buggy function.

To fix the bug, we should assign the `last_active` parameter to the `self.last_active` attribute instead of initializing it to `None`.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
    self.id = worker_id
    self.reference = None  
    self.last_active = last_active if last_active else time.time()  # Assign last_active parameter or current time if None
    self.started = time.time()  
    self.tasks = set()  
    self.info = {}
```

With this fix, the function now correctly assigns the `last_active` parameter if it is provided, or it initializes it with the current time if it is not provided. This change ensures that the expected input/output values are met.
