The bug in the provided function is that the `last_active` parameter is not being assigned correctly. It should be assigned the value of the `last_active` parameter passed to the function, but currently, it is being set to `None`. 

To fix this bug, we need to modify the assignment of the `last_active` variable so that it receives the value passed as the `last_active` parameter.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: luigi/scheduler.py

# Function fixed to correctly assign the last_active parameter
def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
    self.id = worker_id
    self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
    
    if last_active is not None:
        self.last_active = last_active  # assign last_active only if a value is provided
    else:
        self.last_active = time.time()  # set default value to current time
    
    self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
    self.tasks = set()  # task objects
    self.info = {}
```

This corrected function will now correctly assign the `last_active` parameter if a value is provided, or set the default value to the current time if `last_active` is not provided.
