### Cause of the Bug
The bug in the provided function lies in the incorrect assignment of the `last_active` variable. In the buggy function, the `last_active` parameter is not being used to assign a value to `self.last_active`, causing it to remain as `None`. This results in the discrepancy between the expected and actual value of `self.last_active`.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug
To fix the bug, we need to correctly assign the `last_active` parameter to `self.last_active` in the `__init__` function.

### Corrected Version of the Function
```python
def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
    self.id = worker_id
    self.reference = None
    self.last_active = last_active if last_active is not None else time.time()
    self.started = time.time()
    self.tasks = set()
    self.info = {}
```

With this corrected version, the `last_active` parameter will be properly used to assign a value to `self.last_active`, either using the provided `last_active` value or the current time if `last_active` is `None`. This will ensure that the expected and actual values of `self.last_active` match during the function's execution.
