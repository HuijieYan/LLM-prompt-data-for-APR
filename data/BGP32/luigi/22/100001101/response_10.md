### Cause of the bug:
The bug in the given code is that the `last_active` parameter is not correctly assigned to the `self.last_active` variable in the `__init__` function. Instead, it is assigned to `self.started`.

### Strategy for fixing the bug:
To fix this bug, we need to correctly assign the `last_active` parameter to the `self.last_active` variable in the `__init__` function.

### Corrected version of the function:
```python
def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
    self.id = worker_id
    self.reference = None  
    self.last_active = last_active if last_active is not None else time.time()
    self.started = time.time()
    self.tasks = set()  
    self.info = {}
```

By using the corrected version of the function, the `last_active` parameter will be correctly assigned to `self.last_active`, which will result in the expected behavior as described in the test case.
