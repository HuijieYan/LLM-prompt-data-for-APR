The bug in the provided function is that the `last_active` parameter is supposed to be assigned to the `last_active` instance variable, but it is currently assigned to `self.started`.

To fix the bug, we need to correctly assign the `last_active` parameter to the `last_active` instance variable.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
    self.id = worker_id
    self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
    self.last_active = last_active  # seconds since epoch
    self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
    self.tasks = set()  # task objects
    self.info = {}
```

By making this change, the function will correctly assign the `last_active` parameter to the `last_active` instance variable, satisfying the expected input/output values provided.
