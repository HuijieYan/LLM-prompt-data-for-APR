The issue in the current code is that the `last_active` parameter is not properly assigned to the `self.last_active` attribute in the `__init__` function. The `last_active` parameter is named incorrectly which causes the actual value to be assigned to `self.last_active`, leading to unexpected behavior.

To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the `last_active` parameter is correctly assigned to `self.last_active`. 

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
import time

class Worker:
    def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
        self.id = worker_id
        self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
        self.last_active = last_active  # seconds since epoch
        self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        self.tasks = set()  # task objects
        self.info = {}
``` 

With this correction, the `last_active` parameter will be correctly assigned to `self.last_active`, resolving the bug and ensuring that the function works as expected.
