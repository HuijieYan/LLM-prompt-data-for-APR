The bug in the provided function is that the `last_active` parameter is not correctly assigned to the class variable `self.last_active`. Instead, it's being assigned a default value of `None`. To fix this, the `last_active` parameter should be properly assigned to `self.last_active`.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
    self.id = worker_id
    self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
    self.last_active = last_active  # seconds since epoch
    self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
    self.tasks = set()  # task objects
    self.info = {}
```

With this fix, the `last_active` parameter will correctly be assigned to `self.last_active`, and the function will behave as expected.
