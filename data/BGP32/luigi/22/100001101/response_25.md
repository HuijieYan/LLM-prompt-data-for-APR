The bug in the provided function is that the `last_active` parameter is not being assigned correctly to the `self.last_active` variable. It should be assigned to `self.last_active` instead of just `last_active`.

To fix this bug, we need to update the assignment of `last_active` to `self.last_active` in the `__init__` function. 

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
import time

def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
    self.id = worker_id
    self.reference = None
    self.last_active = last_active  # Assigning to correct variable
    self.started = time.time()
    self.tasks = set()
    self.info = {}
```

With this correction, the function will now correctly assign the `last_active` parameter to the `self.last_active` variable, as expected.
