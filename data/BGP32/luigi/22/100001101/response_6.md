The bug in the provided function is that the `last_active` parameter is not being properly assigned to the `last_active` attribute. Instead, it is assigned to the `self.started` attribute.

To fix this bug, we need to correctly assign the `last_active` parameter to the `last_active` attribute. Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
    self.id = worker_id
    self.reference = None
    self.last_active = last_active
    self.started = time.time()
    self.tasks = set()
    self.info = {}
```

With this corrected version, the `last_active` parameter will be assigned to the `last_active` attribute as expected.
