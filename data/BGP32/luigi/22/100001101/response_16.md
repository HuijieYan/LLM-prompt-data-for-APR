The buggy function "__init__" is missing the input parameter "last_active" in the function definition. This causes the function to always set "last_active" as None regardless of the input value provided.

To fix this bug, include the "last_active" parameter in the function definition and assign it to the class attribute "self.last_active" as shown below:

```python
def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
    self.id = worker_id
    self.reference = None
    self.last_active = last_active if last_active is not None else time.time()  # Assign input value or current time
    self.started = time.time()
    self.tasks = set()
    self.info = {}
```

With this modification, the function will assign the input value to "last_active" if provided or use the current time if not, ensuring that the expected behavior is met.
