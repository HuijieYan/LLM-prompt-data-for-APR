The bug in the provided function is that the `last_active` parameter is not being assigned correctly to the `last_active` instance variable. The `last_active` parameter is passed to the function but not used to update the instance variable.

To fix the bug, I will modify the function to assign the `last_active` parameter to the `self.last_active` instance variable.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
    self.id = worker_id
    self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
    self.last_active = last_active  # seconds since epoch
    self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
    self.tasks = set()  # task objects
    self.info = {}
``` 

With this correction, the `last_active` parameter will be properly assigned to the `self.last_active` instance variable, satisfying the expected input/output values.
