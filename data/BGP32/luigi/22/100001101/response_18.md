The issue in the buggy function is that the `last_active` parameter is not being initialized correctly. It is expected to be set to the input value `last_active` when provided, otherwise set to `None`. 

To fix the bug, we need to update the initialization of the `last_active` variable in the function to properly handle the case when the `last_active` parameter is provided.

Here is the corrected version of the function:
```python
def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
    self.id = worker_id
    self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
    self.last_active = last_active if last_active is not None else None  # seconds since epoch
    self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
    self.tasks = set()  # task objects
    self.info = {}
```

Now the function will correctly set the `last_active` variable based on the input parameter provided. This fix ensures that the function behaves as expected in terms of initializing the `last_active` variable.
