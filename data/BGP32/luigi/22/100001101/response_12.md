## Bug Explanation
The bug in the provided function is that the `last_active` parameter, which is intended to be initialized as the value of the `last_active` parameter passed to the function, is not correctly assigned due to incorrect handling of default values. The `last_active` parameter is supposed to default to `None` if not specified, but the provided code initializes it as the current time if no value is specified. This means that the `last_active` parameter is never set to `None` in case it is not provided explicitly.

## Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to modify the initialization of the `last_active` variable to properly handle the default value as `None` when not provided. This can be achieved by adding a conditional check to assign `None` to `self.last_active` if `last_active` is not provided when initializing the `Worker` object.

## Corrected Version of the Function
```python
def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
    self.id = worker_id
    self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
    self.last_active = last_active if last_active is not None else None
    self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
    self.tasks = set()  # task objects
    self.info = {}
```

By making this change, the `last_active` parameter will correctly default to `None` if not provided explicitly, aligning the behavior with the expected input/output values.
