The bug in the provided function lies in the way the `last_active` parameter is handled. The input `last_active` is not being assigned to the class attribute `self.last_active` properly. Instead, it is created as a new variable within the function scope and not used further.

To fix this bug, we need to assign the `last_active` parameter to the `self.last_active` attribute. Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
# The corrected version of the function
def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
    self.id = worker_id
    self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
    
    if last_active is not None:
        self.last_active = last_active
    else:
        self.last_active = time.time()  # seconds since epoch if last_active is not provided
    
    self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
    self.tasks = set()  # task objects
    self.info = {}
```

This corrected version correctly assigns the `last_active` parameter to the `self.last_active` attribute, either using the provided value or the current epoch time if `last_active` is not provided. This change ensures that the expected behavior is met as outlined in the test cases.
