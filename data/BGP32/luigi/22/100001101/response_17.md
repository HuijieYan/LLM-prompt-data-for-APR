The bug in the provided function lies in the initialization of the `last_active` parameter. The current implementation does not assign the provided `last_active` parameter to the `self.last_active` attribute, resulting in a default value of `None`.

To fix this bug, we need to assign the `last_active` parameter to the `self.last_active` attribute.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
    self.id = worker_id
    self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
    self.last_active = last_active  # seconds since epoch
    if last_active is not None:
        self.last_active = last_active
    self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
    self.tasks = set()  # task objects
    self.info = {}
```

By adding the check `if last_active is not None:` before assigning the `last_active` parameter to `self.last_active`, we ensure that the provided `last_active` value is correctly assigned during initialization.

This correction will now properly set the `last_active` attribute to the provided value if it is provided, or keep it as `None` if no value is provided.
