The bug in the provided function is that it doesn't correctly assign the `last_active` value provided as an argument to the `last_active` attribute of the class instance. It mistakenly assigns the `last_active` value to `self.started` instead.

To fix this bug, we need to update the assignment of `last_active` in the `__init__` method to correctly assign it to the `last_active` attribute of the class instance.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
import time

# The relative path of the buggy file: luigi/scheduler.py

def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
    self.id = worker_id
    self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
    self.last_active = last_active  # seconds since epoch
    self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
    self.tasks = set()  # task objects
    self.info = {}
```

By making this change, the `last_active` value provided as an argument will be correctly assigned to the `last_active` attribute of the class instance, resolving the bug.
