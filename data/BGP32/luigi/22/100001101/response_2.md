The bug in the provided function is that the `last_active` parameter is not being properly assigned to the `self.last_active` attribute in the `__init__` method. Instead, it is being left as `None`.

To fix this bug, we need to properly assign the `last_active` parameter to the `self.last_active` attribute. 

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
    self.id = worker_id
    self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
    self.last_active = last_active if last_active is not None else time.time()  # seconds since epoch
    self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
    self.tasks = set()  # task objects
    self.info = {}
```

With this correction, the `last_active` parameter will be assigned to `self.last_active` only if it is not `None`. If it is `None`, then the current time (`time.time()`) will be used as the default value for `self.last_active`.

This correction ensures that the `last_active` parameter is properly assigned to the `self.last_active` attribute in the `__init__` method.
