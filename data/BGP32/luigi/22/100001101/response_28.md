The bug in the provided code is that the `last_active` parameter is not being assigned correctly when initializing the object. Instead, it is always set to `None`. 

To fix this bug, we need to update the initialization of the `last_active` attribute to properly assign the value passed in the `last_active` parameter when creating an instance of the object.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
# The corrected function
def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
    self.id = worker_id
    self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
    self.last_active = last_active if last_active is not None else time.time()  # seconds since epoch
    self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
    self.tasks = set()  # task objects
    self.info = {}
```

With this correction, the `last_active` attribute will be initialized with the value passed as the `last_active` parameter if it is not `None`, otherwise, it will default to the current time. This fix ensures that the code behaves as expected based on the provided test cases.
