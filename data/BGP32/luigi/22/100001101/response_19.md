The bug in the provided function is that the `last_active` parameter is not being assigned correctly to the `self.last_active` attribute in the `__init__` method. Instead, it's utilizing a default value of `None`. To fix this, we need to assign the `last_active` parameter to `self.last_active`.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
    self.id = worker_id
    self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
    self.last_active = last_active if last_active is not None else time.time()  # seconds since epoch or default to current time
    self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
    self.tasks = set()  # task objects
    self.info = {}
```

By incorporating the `if last_active is not None else time.time()` conditional check, we ensure that the `last_active` parameter is correctly assigned if a value is provided during initialization.

This corrected version should now satisfy the expected input/output values for the provided case.
