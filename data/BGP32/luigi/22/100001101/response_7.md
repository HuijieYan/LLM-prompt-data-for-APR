### Bug Explanation
The bug in the provided function is that it does not correctly initialize the `last_active` variable. In the buggy function, the `last_active` parameter is set to `None`, but in the failing test execution, it is expected to have a specific value (`1709218610.8782065`). This leads to incorrect behavior when setting the `self.last_active` variable, which affects the overall functionality of the function.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to update the function to correctly initialize the `last_active` variable with the provided input value when it is not `None`. This adjustment will ensure that the function behaves as expected and sets the `self.last_active` variable correctly.

### Corrected Function
```python
def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
    self.id = worker_id
    self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
    self.last_active = last_active if last_active is not None else time.time()  # seconds since epoch
    self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
    self.tasks = set()  # task objects
    self.info = {}
```

After implementing the corrected function, the `last_active` variable is initialized with the provided value if it is not `None`, otherwise it will be set to the current time using `time.time()`. This modification ensures that the function behaves as expected and correctly initializes the variables according to the input parameters.
