### Analysis
The bug in the provided function is that the `last_active` parameter is not being assigned properly. Instead, it is defaulted to `None` at the function definition. This leads to discrepancies between the expected and actual values of `last_active` in the runtime and expected cases.

### Bug Cause
The bug is caused by not initializing the `last_active` parameter correctly in the `__init__` function of the class.

### Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to modify the `__init__` function to properly assign the `last_active` parameter if a value is provided during the function call.

### Corrected Code
```python
# The corrected function
def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
    self.id = worker_id
    self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
    self.last_active = last_active if last_active is not None else time.time()  # seconds since epoch
    self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
    self.tasks = set()  # task objects
    self.info = {}
``` 

By checking if the `last_active` parameter is `None`, we can assign the current time using `time.time()` when a value is not provided, ensuring that it captures the correct time in seconds since epoch.
