The bug in the `__init__` function is that the `last_active` parameter is not being assigned correctly. The code is not updating the `self.last_active` variable with the provided `last_active` parameter value. As a result, the value of `last_active` is not being set as expected.

To fix this bug, we need to assign the `last_active` parameter to the `self.last_active` variable inside the `__init__` function.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
    self.id = worker_id
    self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
    self.last_active = last_active  # seconds since epoch
    self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
    self.tasks = set()  # task objects
    self.info = {}

    if last_active is not None:
        self.last_active = last_active
```

With this change, the provided `last_active` parameter will be correctly assigned to `self.last_active`, ensuring the expected behavior of setting the last active time.
