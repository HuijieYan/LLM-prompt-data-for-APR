The bug in the provided function is that the `last_active` parameter is not being properly assigned. The expected input `last_active` is not being used in the function definition. To correct this bug, we need to update the function to assign the `last_active` parameter to the `self.last_active` variable.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
    self.id = worker_id
    self.reference = None
    self.last_active = last_active if last_active is not None else time.time()
    self.started = time.time()
    self.tasks = set()
    self.info = {}
```

By using the provided `last_active` parameter or defaulting to the current time if no value is provided, we ensure that the `last_active` variable is assigned correctly based on the input. This corrected version should now satisfy the expected input/output values.
