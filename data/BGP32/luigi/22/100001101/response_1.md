## Bug Explanation
The bug in the `__init__` function stems from the incorrect assignment of the `last_active` parameter. The function is currently assigning the input parameter `last_active` directly to `self.last_active`, but in the failing test case, `last_active` is not passed as an argument, resulting in a `None` value being assigned to `self.last_active`. However, in the expected values, there is a specific value for `last_active`. 

## Bug Fix Strategy
To fix this bug, we need to modify the `__init__` function to properly handle the optional `last_active` parameter. If `last_active` is not provided, it should default to `None`.

## The corrected version of the function
```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: luigi/scheduler.py

def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
    self.id = worker_id
    self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
    self.last_active = last_active if last_active is not None else time.time()  # seconds since epoch or default to current time
    self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
    self.tasks = set()  # task objects
    self.info = {}
```  

After making this correction, the function will behave as expected.
