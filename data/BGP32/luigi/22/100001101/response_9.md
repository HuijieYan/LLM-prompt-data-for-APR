The issue in the buggy function is that the `last_active` parameter is not being properly assigned when the function is called.

### Cause of the bug:
The `last_active` parameter is being passed correctly but is not being assigned to the `self.last_active` attribute in the `__init__` function. This results in `self.last_active` retaining its default value of `None`.

### Strategy for fixing the bug:
To fix the bug, we need to assign the `last_active` parameter to the `self.last_active` attribute inside the `__init__` function.

### Corrected version of the function:
```python
def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
    self.id = worker_id
    self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
    self.last_active = last_active if last_active is not None else time.time()  # seconds since epoch
    self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
    self.tasks = set()  # task objects
    self.info = {}
```

By checking if the `last_active` parameter is `None`, we ensure that it defaults to the current time when not explicitly provided. This corrected version should now correctly assign the `last_active` parameter when provided, and default to the current time if not specified.
