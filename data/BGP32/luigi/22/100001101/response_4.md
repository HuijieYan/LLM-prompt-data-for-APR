The bug in the provided function is that the `last_active` parameter is not being assigned properly. It is being initialized correctly as `None`, but in the runtime values section, it is showing a different value which indicates a discrepancy.

To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the `last_active` parameter is correctly assigned to the `self.last_active` variable in the `__init__` function.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
import time

def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
    self.id = worker_id
    self.reference = None  
    self.last_active = last_active if last_active is not None else time.time()  
    self.started = time.time()  
    self.tasks = set()  
    self.info = {}
```
