The bug in the provided code is that the `last_active` parameter is not being properly assigned to the `self.last_active` instance variable in the `__init__` function. The `last_active` parameter is defined with a default value of `None`, which means that if a value is not provided when calling the function, it should default to `None`. However, in the test case, a specific value is provided for `last_active`, which should be assigned to the `self.last_active` variable.

To fix this bug, we need to correctly assign the `last_active` parameter to the `self.last_active` variable. Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
    self.id = worker_id
    self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
    self.last_active = last_active if last_active is not None else time.time()  # seconds since epoch
    self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
    self.tasks = set()  # task objects
    self.info = {}
```

With this correction, the `last_active` parameter is properly assigned to `self.last_active`, either using the provided value or the current time if no value is provided. This ensures that the function behaves as expected in the test case provided.
