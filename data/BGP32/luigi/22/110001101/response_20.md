## Analysis
The bug in the `__init__` function of the `Worker` class is due to the incorrect assignment of the `last_active` parameter. The expected `last_active` value is not being correctly assigned from the input `last_active` parameter.

## Bug Explanation
The bug causes the `last_active` parameter to not be correctly assigned, leading to discrepancies between the expected and actual values of `last_active`. This results in a failing test case where the `last_active` value is incorrect.

## Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, the `last_active` parameter should be assigned correctly in the `__init__` function of the `Worker` class. By ensuring that the input `last_active` value is properly used when initializing the `Worker` object, the bug can be resolved.

## Corrected Version
```python
class Worker(object):
    """
    Structure for tracking worker activity and keeping their references.
    """

    def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
        self.id = worker_id
        self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
        self.last_active = last_active if last_active is not None else time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        self.tasks = set()  # task objects
        self.info = {}
``` 

By updating the assignment of `self.last_active` to use the input `last_active` parameter if it is not None, we ensure that the correct value is used during initialization. This corrected version should now correctly assign the `last_active` parameter and resolve the bug.
