### Bug Explanation
The bug in the provided function is that the `last_active` parameter is not being correctly assigned to the `self.last_active` attribute. The function is initializing `self.last_active` with the value of `last_active`, which should be assigned to the `self.last_active` attribute instead.

### Fix Strategy
To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the `last_active` parameter is correctly assigned to the `self.last_active` attribute during initialization.

### Corrected Version
```python
class Worker(object):
    """
    Structure for tracking worker activity and keeping their references.
    """

    def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
        self.id = worker_id
        self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
        self.last_active = last_active if last_active is not None else time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        self.tasks = set()  # task objects
        self.info = {}
``` 

In the corrected version, we make sure to assign the `last_active` parameter to the `self.last_active` attribute only if it is provided during the initialization. Otherwise, we initialize `self.last_active` with the current time using `time.time()`.
