The bug in the given code is that the `last_active` parameter is not being properly assigned in the `__init__` function. The `last_active` parameter is being passed incorrectly as a default value instead of the provided input value.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the assignment of `last_active` in the `__init__` function to properly handle the case when a `last_active` parameter is passed during initialization.

Here is the corrected version of the code:

```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: luigi/scheduler.py

# The declaration of the class containing the corrected function
class Worker(object):
    """
    Structure for tracking worker activity and keeping their references.
    """

    def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
        self.id = worker_id
        self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
        if last_active is not None:
            self.last_active = last_active
        else:
            self.last_active = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        self.tasks = set()  # task objects
        self.info = {}
```

With this modification, the `last_active` parameter will be properly assigned the provided value when provided, or the current time otherwise. This corrected version should now satisfy the expected input/output values mentioned in the cases provided.
