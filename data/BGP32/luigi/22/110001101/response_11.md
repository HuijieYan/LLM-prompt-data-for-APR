## Bug Explanation
The bug in the `__init__` function of the `Worker` class is that the `last_active` parameter is not correctly assigned to the `self.last_active` attribute. Instead, it is assigning the current time to `self.started`.

## Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to assign the `last_active` parameter to the `self.last_active` attribute instead of assigning the current time. This will ensure that the `last_active` parameter passed during initialization is correctly stored.

## Corrected Version
```python
class Worker(object):
    """
    Structure for tracking worker activity and keeping their references.
    """

    def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
        self.id = worker_id
        self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
        self.last_active = last_active  # seconds since epoch
        self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        self.tasks = set()  # task objects
        self.info = {}
``` 

In this corrected version, the `last_active` parameter is correctly assigned to the `self.last_active` attribute.
