### Bug Explanation
The bug in the current implementation is that the `last_active` parameter is not being stored correctly in the `self.last_active` attribute. It is being assigned to the `last_active` parameter directly rather than the `self.last_active`. This results in `self.last_active` not being initialized correctly.

### Fix Strategy
To fix this bug, we need to assign the `last_active` parameter to the `self.last_active` attribute in the `__init__` method.

### Corrected Version

```python
# The declaration of the class containing the corrected function
class Worker(object):
    """
    Structure for tracking worker activity and keeping their references.
    """

    def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
        self.id = worker_id
        self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
        self.last_active = last_active  # seconds since epoch
        self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        self.tasks = set()  # task objects
        self.info = {}

        if last_active is not None:
            self.last_active = last_active  # Assigning last_active parameter to self.last_active
``` 

This corrected version ensures that the `last_active` parameter is correctly assigned to the `self.last_active` attribute in the `__init__` method, satisfying the expected input/output values.
