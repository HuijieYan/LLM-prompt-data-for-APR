The bug in the provided function lies in the initialization of the `last_active` variable. In the buggy function, the `last_active` variable is not being set to the input parameter `last_active`, leading to a discrepancy between the expected and actual values.

To fix the bug, we need to correctly assign the value of the `last_active` input parameter to the `self.last_active` variable in the `__init__` function.

Here is the corrected version of the `__init__` function:
```python
def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
    self.id = worker_id
    self.reference = None
    self.last_active = last_active if last_active is not None else time.time()  # Updated line
    self.started = time.time()
    self.tasks = set()
    self.info = {}
```

By making this change, the `last_active` variable will be correctly initialized with the provided input value or the current time if no value is provided.

This update ensures that the function will now correctly set the `last_active` variable based on the input parameter values, aligning with the expected behavior outlined in the test cases.
