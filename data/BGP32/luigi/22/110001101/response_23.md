## Bug Explanation
The bug in the `__init__` function of the `Worker` class is due to the incorrect assignment of the `last_active` parameter. In the buggy code, the `last_active` parameter is directly assigned to the `self.last_active` attribute without any checks or modifications. This causes the timestamp stored in `last_active` to be assigned as it is, leading to incorrect values in the `last_active` attribute.

## Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to modify the assignment of the `last_active` parameter in the `__init__` function. We should check if the `last_active` parameter is provided, and if not, assign the current time as the default value for `last_active`.

## Corrected Function
```python
class Worker(object):
    """
    Structure for tracking worker activity and keeping their references.
    """

    def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
        self.id = worker_id
        self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
        self.last_active = last_active if last_active is not None else time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        self.tasks = set()  # task objects
        self.info = {}
```

After applying this fix, the `last_active` attribute will be correctly assigned either with the provided `last_active` parameter or with the current time as the default value, ensuring the expected behavior of the `Worker` class.
