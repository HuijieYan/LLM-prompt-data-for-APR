### Analysis
1. The buggy function is the `__init__` method of the `Worker` class.
2. The bug involves the `last_active` parameter not being assigned correctly.
3. In the provided test case, the `last_active` parameter is not being passed during the call to the `__init__` method, leading to the default value of `None` being used.
4. To fix the bug, we need to correctly assign the `last_active` parameter when it is provided.

### Bug Fix
```python
class Worker(object):
    """
    Structure for tracking worker activity and keeping their references.
    """

    def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
        self.id = worker_id
        self.reference = None
        self.last_active = last_active if last_active is not None else time.time()
        self.started = time.time()
        self.tasks = set()
        self.info = {}
```

By checking if the `last_active` parameter is not `None`, we can correctly assign the current time if a specific time is not provided. This ensures that the `last_active` parameter is correctly initialized in all cases.
