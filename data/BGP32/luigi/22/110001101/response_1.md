The bug in the `__init__` method of the `Worker` class is that the `last_active` parameter is not being correctly assigned to the `self.last_active` variable. 

The `last_active` parameter is supposed to be assigning a numerical value representing seconds since epoch, but the buggy code is not updating `self.last_active` with this value. Instead, it remains set to `None`.

To fix this bug, we need to assign the `last_active` parameter to the `self.last_active` variable in the `__init__` method.

Here is the corrected version of the `__init__` method:

```python
def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
    self.id = worker_id
    self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
    if last_active is not None:
        self.last_active = last_active
    else:
        self.last_active = time.time()  # seconds since epoch if last_active is not provided
    self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
    self.tasks = set()  # task objects
    self.info = {}
```

By checking if the `last_active` parameter is not `None`, we can assign it to `self.last_active` correctly. If `last_active` is not provided, we initialize `self.last_active` to the current time using `time.time()`.
