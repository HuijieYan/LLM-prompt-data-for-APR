### Explanation:
The bug in the `__init__` method arises from the fact that the `last_active` parameter is not getting assigned properly, resulting in `None` being stored in `self.last_active` instead of the actual input `last_active` value.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to correctly assign the `last_active` parameter to `self.last_active` in the `__init__` method.

### Corrected Version:
```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: luigi/scheduler.py

# The declaration of the class containing the corrected function
class Worker(object):
    """
    Structure for tracking worker activity and keeping their references.
    """

    def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
        self.id = worker_id
        self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
        self.last_active = last_active if last_active is not None else time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        self.tasks = set()  # task objects
        self.info = {}
``` 

This corrected version ensures that if the `last_active` parameter is not provided, the current time is used instead. This fix addresses the bug and correctly assigns the `last_active` parameter to `self.last_active`.
