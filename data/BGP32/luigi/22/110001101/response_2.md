The bug in the provided code is that the `last_active` parameter is not properly assigned in the `__init__` function. The `last_active` parameter in the function signature is not being used to update the `self.last_active` attribute.

To fix this bug, we need to assign the `last_active` parameter to the `self.last_active` attribute in the `__init__` function.

Here is the corrected version of the `__init__` function:

```python
    def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
        self.id = worker_id
        self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
        self.last_active = last_active  # seconds since epoch
        self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        self.tasks = set()  # task objects
        self.info = {}
```

This fix ensures that the `last_active` parameter is properly assigned to the `self.last_active` attribute, which aligns with the expected behavior as described in the provided runtime and expected values.
