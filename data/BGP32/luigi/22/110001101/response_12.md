The bug in the provided function is that it doesn't correctly initialize the `last_active` parameter when it is provided. The `last_active` parameter is meant to be assigned to the `self.last_active` attribute of the Worker object, but it is currently being assigned incorrectly.

The bug arises from the fact that the `last_active` parameter is being assigned directly to `self.last_active` in the __init__ method, but this assignment is incorrect. Instead, the correct assignment should be:
```python
self.last_active = last_active if last_active is not None else time.time()
```
This ensures that if the `last_active` parameter is provided, it is assigned to `self.last_active`, otherwise the current timestamp is used.

Here is the corrected version of the buggy function:
```python
# The declaration of the class containing the corrected function
class Worker(object):
    """
    Structure for tracking worker activity and keeping their references.
    """

    def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
        self.id = worker_id
        self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
        self.last_active = last_active if last_active is not None else time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        self.tasks = set()  # task objects
        self.info = {}
```

This corrected version ensures that the `last_active` parameter is correctly handled when provided, and defaults to the current timestamp when not provided.
