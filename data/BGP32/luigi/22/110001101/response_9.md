### Bug Explanation
The bug in the `__init__` function of the `Worker` class is related to the `last_active` parameter. In the buggy function, the `last_active` parameter is being set directly to the `last_active` class variable. This results in the `last_active` class variable always being `None` unless explicitly provided in the constructor.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to correctly assign the `last_active` parameter to the `last_active` class variable. If the `last_active` parameter is not provided, it should default to `None`.

### Corrected Version of the Function
```python
class Worker(object):
    """
    Structure for tracking worker activity and keeping their references.
    """

    def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
        self.id = worker_id
        self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
        self.last_active = last_active if last_active is not None else None  # seconds since epoch or None if not provided
        self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        self.tasks = set()  # task objects
        self.info = {}
``` 

With this correction, the `last_active` parameter is correctly assigned to the `last_active` class variable in the `Worker` class. Now, if `last_active` is not provided, it defaults to `None` as expected.
