### Bug Explanation
The bug in the `__init__` function of the `Worker` class is that the `last_active` parameter is not being correctly assigned. In the provided runtime values, it shows that `last_active` is `None`, but in the expected values, it is expected to have a specific float value.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that if `last_active` is provided as a parameter, it should be assigned to the `last_active` variable in the `Worker` instance. Otherwise, it should default to `None`.

### Corrected Version
```python
class Worker(object):
    """
    Structure for tracking worker activity and keeping their references.
    """

    def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
        self.id = worker_id
        self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
        
        if last_active is not None:
            self.last_active = last_active
        else:
            self.last_active = None
        
        self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        self.tasks = set()  # task objects
        self.info = {}
```
