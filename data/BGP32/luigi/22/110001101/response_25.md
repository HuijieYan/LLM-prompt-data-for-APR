### Explanation:
The bug in the current implementation lies in the initialization of the `last_active` attribute in the `__init__` method of the `Worker` class. The `last_active` is set to `None` by default, but in the failing test case, `last_active` is actually provided during the object creation of the `Worker` class.

### Bug:
The current implementation does not handle the case where `last_active` is provided as an input during object creation, leading to an incorrect initialization of the `last_active` attribute.

### Fix:
Modify the `__init__` method to properly handle the case where `last_active` is provided as an input.

### The corrected version of the function:

```python
class Worker(object):
    """
    Structure for tracking worker activity and keeping their references.
    """

    def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
        self.id = worker_id
        self.reference = None
        self.last_active = last_active if last_active is not None else time.time()
        self.started = time.time()
        self.tasks = set()
        self.info = {}
```

By adding a check to assign the provided `last_active` value if it's not None, we ensure that the `last_active` attribute is initialized correctly based on the input during object creation.
