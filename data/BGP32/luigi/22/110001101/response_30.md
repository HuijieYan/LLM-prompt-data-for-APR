The bug in the provided function is that the `last_active` parameter is not properly assigned to the `self.last_active` attribute. The `last_active` parameter is passed to the `__init__` method but not assigned to the class attribute correctly.

To fix the bug, we need to update the assignment of the `last_active` parameter to the `self.last_active` attribute.

Here is the corrected version of the `__init__` method:
```python
    def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
        self.id = worker_id
        self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
        self.last_active = last_active if last_active is not None else time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        self.tasks = set()  # task objects
        self.info = {}
```

With this correction, the `last_active` parameter will be properly assigned to `self.last_active` in the `Worker` class constructor.

This should address the bug and ensure that the `last_active` parameter is correctly initialized for the `Worker` objects.
