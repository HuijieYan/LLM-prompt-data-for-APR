### Bug Explanation
The bug in the `__init__` function arises from the `last_active` parameter not being correctly assigned. In the buggy function, the `last_active` parameter is assigned to the `self.last_active` attribute, but the expected input value for `last_active` is not being used.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to make sure that the `last_active` parameter is assigned to the `self.last_active` attribute in the `__init__` function.

### Corrected Version
```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: luigi/scheduler.py

# The declaration of the class containing the corrected function
class Worker(object):
    """
    Structure for tracking worker activity and keeping their references.
    """

    def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
        self.id = worker_id
        self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
        self.last_active = last_active if last_active is not None else time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        self.tasks = set()  # task objects
        self.info = {}
```

By including a check for `last_active` being `None` and using `time.time()` if it is `None, we ensure that the correct value is assigned to `self.last_active` in the `__init__` function.
