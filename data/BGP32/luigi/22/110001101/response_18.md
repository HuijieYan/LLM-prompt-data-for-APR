## Bug Explanation
The bug in the `__init__` function is that it is not assigning the `last_active` parameter correctly when it is provided. The function always initializes `last_active` with the value passed in as `None` instead of using the provided `last_active` value.

## Fix Strategy
To fix this bug, the `last_active` parameter needs to be properly assigned when it is provided in the function call.

## The corrected version of the buggy function
```python
class Worker(object):
    """
    Structure for tracking worker activity and keeping their references.
    """

    def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
        self.id = worker_id
        self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
        if last_active is not None:
            self.last_active = last_active
        else:
            self.last_active = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        self.tasks = set()  # task objects
        self.info = {}
``` 

With this fix, the `last_active` parameter is properly assigned in the `__init__` function, using the provided value when it is not `None`.
