The bug in the provided function is that the `last_active` parameter is not being assigned correctly in the `__init__` method. It is being set to the default value of `None` instead of the provided value.

To fix this bug, we need to update the assignment of `last_active` in the `__init__` method to properly assign the value passed to the function.

Here is the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
class Worker(object):
    """
    Structure for tracking worker activity and keeping their references.
    """

    def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
        self.id = worker_id
        self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
        self.last_active = last_active if last_active is not None else time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        self.tasks = set()  # task objects
        self.info = {}
```

This correction ensures that if a `last_active` value is provided during the instantiation of a Worker object, it will be properly assigned to the `last_active` attribute. If no value is provided, it defaults to the current time.
