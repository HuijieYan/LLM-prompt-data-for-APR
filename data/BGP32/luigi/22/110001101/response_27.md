The bug in the provided code is that the `last_active` parameter in the `__init__` function is not being properly assigned to the `last_active` attribute of the `Worker` class instance. Instead, it is directly assigning the `last_active` parameter to the `self.last_active` attribute, causing the expected value not to be set correctly.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the initialization to properly assign the `last_active` parameter to the `last_active` attribute of the `Worker` class instance. 

Here is the corrected version of the `__init__` function:

```python
def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
    self.id = worker_id
    self.reference = None
    self.last_active = last_active if last_active is not None else time.time()  # Assign last_active parameter or current time
    self.started = time.time()
    self.tasks = set()
    self.info = {}
```

By using a conditional statement, we assign the `last_active` parameter to the `self.last_active` attribute only if it is not `None`. If `last_active` is `None`, then we set `self.last_active` to the current time using `time.time()`.

This correction ensures that the expected value of `last_active` is properly set in the `Worker` class instance.
