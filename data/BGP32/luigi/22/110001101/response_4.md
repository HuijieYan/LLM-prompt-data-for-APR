The bug in the current implementation is that the `last_active` parameter is not being assigned the provided value `last_active=None` when the `__init__` method is called. Therefore, the `last_active` attribute remains as `None` even if a value is passed as an argument.

To fix this bug, the `last_active` parameter should be assigned to the `self.last_active` attribute in the `__init__` method.

Here is the corrected version of the `__init__` method in the `Worker` class:

```python
def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
    self.id = worker_id
    self.reference = None
    self.last_active = last_active  # Assign the parameter value to the attribute
    self.started = time.time()
    self.tasks = set()
    self.info = {}
```

With this correction, the `last_active` attribute will now correctly take the value passed as an argument or default to `None` if no value is provided, fulfilling the expected behavior.
