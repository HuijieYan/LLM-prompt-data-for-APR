### Analysis:
The bug in the current implementation is that the `last_active` parameter is not being assigned to the `self.last_active` attribute in the `__init__` function. This leads to `self.last_active` retaining the default value of `None` instead of the value passed in as `last_active`.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is caused by the missing assignment of the `last_active` parameter to the `self.last_active` attribute in the `__init__` function.

### Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to explicitly assign the `last_active` parameter to the `self.last_active` attribute in the `__init__` function.

### Corrected Version:
```python
class Worker(object):
    """
    Structure for tracking worker activity and keeping their references.
    """

    def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
        self.id = worker_id
        self.reference = None
        self.last_active = last_active if last_active is not None else time.time()
        self.started = time.time()
        self.tasks = set()
        self.info = {}
```

With this corrected version, the `last_active` parameter is now properly assigned to the `self.last_active` attribute in the `__init__` function, ensuring that the expected behavior is achieved.
