### Bug Explanation
The bug in the current implementation is related to the `last_active` parameter in the `__init__` method of the `Worker` class. The `last_active` parameter in the function definition is set to `None`, which causes an issue when trying to assign it to a float value afterwards. This results in incorrect initialization of the `last_active` attribute, leading to unexpected behavior in the runtime values.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the `last_active` parameter is properly handled when passed to the `__init__` method of the `Worker` class. We should assign the `last_active` parameter directly to the `self.last_active` attribute without any additional processing.

### Corrected Version of the Function
```python
# The declaration of the class containing the buggy function
class Worker(object):
    """
    Structure for tracking worker activity and keeping their references.
    """

    # Corrected version of the __init__ function
    def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
        self.id = worker_id
        self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
        self.last_active = last_active  # seconds since epoch
        self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        self.tasks = set()  # task objects
        self.info = {}
```

By directly assigning the `last_active` parameter to `self.last_active` without any additional processing, the corrected version of the function should now correctly handle the initialization of the `last_active` attribute, satisfying the expected input/output values.
