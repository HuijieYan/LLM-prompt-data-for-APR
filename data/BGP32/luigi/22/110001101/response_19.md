The bug in the provided function is that the `last_active` parameter is not being correctly assigned in the `__init__` method. 

The expected behavior is to assign the `last_active` parameter to the `self.last_active` attribute, but currently, it is not being assigned correctly in the buggy function. 

To fix this bug, we need to update the `__init__` method to properly assign the `last_active` parameter to the `self.last_active` attribute.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: luigi/scheduler.py

# The declaration of the class containing the corrected function
class Worker(object):
    """
    Structure for tracking worker activity and keeping their references.
    """

    def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
        self.id = worker_id
        self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
        self.last_active = last_active if last_active is not None else time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        self.tasks = set()  # task objects
        self.info = {}
```

This corrected version assigns the `last_active` parameter to the `self.last_active` attribute if it is provided, otherwise, it defaults to the current time using `time.time()`. This ensures that `last_active` is correctly initialized in the `Worker` class.
