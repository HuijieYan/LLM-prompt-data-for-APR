The bug in the provided code is related to the incorrect assignment of the `last_active` parameter in the `__init__` function of the `Worker` class. The `last_active` attribute is assigned the value of the `last_active` parameter only if it is provided, otherwise, it remains `None`. This leads to the discrepancy between the expected and actual values of `last_active` during the failing test execution.

To fix this bug, we should update the assignment of the `last_active` attribute to properly handle the case when the `last_active` parameter is provided. 

Here is the corrected version of the code:

```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: luigi/scheduler.py

# The declaration of the class containing the corrected function
class Worker(object):
    """
    Structure for tracking worker activity and keeping their references.
    """

    def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
        self.id = worker_id
        self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
        self.last_active = last_active if last_active is not None else time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        self.tasks = set()  # task objects
        self.info = {}
```

With this correction, the `last_active` attribute will be assigned the value of the `last_active` parameter if it is provided, otherwise, it will default to the current time using `time.time()`.

This fix ensures that the expected and actual values match during test execution.
