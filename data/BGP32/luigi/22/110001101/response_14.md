## Bug explanation
The bug in the `__init__` function lies in the way the `last_active` parameter is handled. In the buggy code, the `last_active` parameter is being assigned directly to the `last_active` attribute of the `Worker` instance. However, in the failing test case, the expected value for `last_active` is different from the input value, suggesting that there should be some manipulation or calculation involved before assigning it to `last_active`.

## Bug fix strategy
To fix the bug, the `last_active` parameter needs to be properly processed before assigning it to the `last_active` attribute of the `Worker` instance. This processing could involve checking if `last_active` is `None` and then assigning a default value based on that condition or applying some calculations to generate the correct value for `last_active`.

## The corrected version of the function
```python
class Worker(object):
    """
    Structure for tracking worker activity and keeping their references.
    """


    def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
        self.id = worker_id
        self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
        
        if last_active is None:
            self.last_active = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        else:
            self.last_active = last_active
        
        self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        self.tasks = set()  # task objects
        self.info = {}
```

By incorporating the conditional statement to handle cases where `last_active` is `None`, the corrected version ensures that proper processing is done before assigning the value to the `last_active` attribute of the `Worker` instance. This update aligns with the expected behavior and fixes the bug in the original function.
