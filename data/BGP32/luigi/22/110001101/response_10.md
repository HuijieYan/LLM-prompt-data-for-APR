### Explanation
The bug in the `__init__` function lies in the incorrect assignment of the `last_active` parameter. In the buggy function, the `last_active` parameter is directly assigned to the class variable `self.last_active`. However, in the failing test case, the `last_active` parameter and the expected value are different, indicating that this assignment is incorrect.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug
To fix the bug, the `last_active` parameter should be assigned to `self.last_active` without any modification, as it directly reflects the input value.

### Corrected Version of the Function
```python
def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
    self.id = worker_id
    self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
    self.last_active = last_active  # seconds since epoch
    self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
    self.tasks = set()  # task objects
    self.info = {}
``` 

With this correction, the function will correctly assign the `last_active` value provided as a parameter to the class variable `self.last_active`, fixing the bug.
