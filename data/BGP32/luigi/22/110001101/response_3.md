### Bug Explanation
The bug in the `__init__` function is with the `last_active` parameter. The expected value for `last_active` in the failing test is `1709218610.8782065` but the function is not correctly assigning this value to `self.last_active`.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the `last_active` parameter passed into the `__init__` function is correctly assigned to `self.last_active`.

### Corrected Version of the Function
```python
def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
    self.id = worker_id
    self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
    self.last_active = last_active if last_active is not None else time.time()  # seconds since epoch
    self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
    self.tasks = set()  # task objects
    self.info = {}
```

With this correction, the `last_active` parameter will be correctly assigned to `self.last_active` if it is provided, otherwise the current time will be used.
