### Analysis
The bug in the provided function lies in how the `last_active` parameter is being assigned in the `__init__` function. The `last_active` parameter is supposed to default to `None` if not provided, but the actual default value assigned is the time when the script started (`time.time()`). This results in unexpected behavior when trying to initialize a `Worker` object with the default `last_active` value.

### Bug Explanation
The bug is caused by the incorrect assignment of `last_active` in the `__init__` function. Instead of defaulting to `None`, it is set to the current time when the script starts. This causes discrepancies between the expected and actual values of `last_active`.

### Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to modify the initialization of the `last_active` parameter inside the `__init__` function. We should explicitly check if `last_active` is `None` and assign it to `None` if no value is provided.

### Corrected Version
```python
class Worker(object):
    """
    Structure for tracking worker activity and keeping their references.
    """

    def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
        self.id = worker_id
        self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
        self.last_active = last_active if last_active is not None else None
        self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        self.tasks = set()  # task objects
        self.info = {}
```

After making this correction, the `__init__` function will correctly assign `None` to `last_active` when no value is provided. This will ensure that the expected behavior is consistent with the actual execution of the function.
