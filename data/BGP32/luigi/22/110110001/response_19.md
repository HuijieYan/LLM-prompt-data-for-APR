### Analysis:
The error message indicates that there is a `TypeError` occurring because the addition operation is being performed between a `NoneType` and an `int`. This is happening in the `prune` method of the `Worker` class when checking if the worker should be deleted based on the last active time and a configured disconnect delay.

### Error Location:
The error is occurring in the `prune` method of the `Worker` class when checking if the last active time plus the disconnect delay is less than the current time.

### Cause of the Bug:
The bug is caused by the `last_active` attribute of the `Worker` class being initialized with a default value of `None`. This leads to the `TypeError` because `None` cannot be added to an `int`.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
We need to modify the initialization of the `last_active` attribute in the `Worker` class so that it defaults to the current time if no value is provided. This will ensure that it is always an integer value representing the time in seconds.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
class Worker(object):
    """
    Structure for tracking worker activity and keeping their references.
    """

    def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
        self.id = worker_id
        self.reference = None
        self.last_active = last_active if last_active is not None else time.time()  # Initialize to current time if None
        self.started = time.time()
        self.tasks = set()
        self.info = {}
```

By initializing `last_active` to the current time if it is not provided, we ensure that it is always an integer value, avoiding the `TypeError` when performing arithmetic operations. This correction should address the bug and make the failing test pass successfully.
