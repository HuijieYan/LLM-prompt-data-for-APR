## Analysis
1. The buggy function is the `__init__` constructor of the `Worker` class in the `luigi/scheduler.py` file.
2. The error is a `TypeError` raised due to attempting to add an integer to a `NoneType`.
3. The cause of the bug is that the `last_active` parameter of the `Worker` constructor can be `None`, and when the `prune` method is called later with a configuration object that expects `last_active` to be a timestamp, the addition operation between `None` and an integer raises an error.
4. To fix the bug, we need to set a default timestamp value (e.g., the current time) for `last_active` in the `__init__` method if `last_active` is `None`.
5. The corrected version of the `Worker` class is provided below:

## Corrected Version
```python
import time

# The declaration of the class containing the buggy function
class Worker(object):
    """
    Structure for tracking worker activity and keeping their references.
    """

    # The corrected version of the buggy function
    def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
        self.id = worker_id
        self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
        self.last_active = last_active if last_active is not None else time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        self.tasks = set()  # task objects
        self.info = {}
    
    def prune(self, config):
        # Delete workers that haven't said anything for a while (probably killed)
        if self.last_active + config.worker_disconnect_delay < time.time():
            pass  # Add logic here as required
```

In the corrected version, we ensure that if `last_active` is `None` in the constructor, we set it to the current time using `time.time()`. This eliminates the `TypeError` when trying to add an integer to `None`.
