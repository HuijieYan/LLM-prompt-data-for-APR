### Analysis:
1. **Bug**: The buggy function `__init__` in the `Worker` class does not properly initialize the `last_active` attribute, which leads to a `NoneType` error when trying to compare it to an integer in the `prune` method.
   
2. **Error Location**: The error occurs in the `prune` method when trying to check if `self.last_active` (which is initialized as `None` in the `__init__` method) is less than a certain time threshold.
   
3. **Cause of the Bug**: The bug is caused by the absence of proper initialization of the `last_active` attribute in the `__init__` method. This causes it to default to `None`, resulting in a `NoneType` error when the `prune` method tries to compare it with an integer. This triggers the `TypeError` during the test case execution.

4. **Strategy for Fixing the Bug**: The bug can be fixed by checking if `last_active` is `None` before performing the comparison in the `prune` method. If it is `None`, set it to the current time. This ensures that `last_active` always contains a valid value for comparison.

5. **Corrected Version**:
```python
class Worker(object):
    """
    Structure for tracking worker activity and keeping their references.
    """

    def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
        self.id = worker_id
        self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
        self.last_active = last_active if last_active is not None else time.time()  # seconds since epoch or current time
        self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        self.tasks = set()  # task objects
        self.info = {}

    def prune(self, config):
        # Delete workers that haven't said anything for a while (probably killed)
        if self.last_active is None:
            self.last_active = time.time()  # Set last_active to current time if it is None
        if self.last_active + config.worker_disconnect_delay < time.time():
            # Perform pruning operation
            pass
```

By adding the check for `None` value in the initialization of `last_active` and setting it to the current time if `None`, the corrected version ensures that the `prune` method can compare `last_active` with an integer without causing a `TypeError`. This fix should resolve the bug and make the test case pass successfully.
