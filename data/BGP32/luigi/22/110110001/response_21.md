1. The buggy function is the `__init__` method of the `Worker` class in the file `luigi/scheduler.py`. The error occurs when trying to create a `Worker` object and call the `prune` method on it in the failing test in the `SchedulerTest` class in the file `test/scheduler_test.py`. The error message indicates a `TypeError` due to unsupported operand types in the `prune` method.

2. The potential error location is in the calculation of `self.last_active + config.worker_disconnect_delay` in the `prune` method of the `Worker` class.

3. The cause of the bug is that `self.last_active` is initialized with a default value of `None`, which causes a `TypeError` when trying to perform addition with an integer value in the `prune` method. The failing test confirms this by referencing the unsupported operand types for addition.

4. To fix the bug, we need to ensure that `self.last_active` is a valid integer value before performing addition with `config.worker_disconnect_delay`.

5. Corrected version of the `Worker` class with fixed `__init__` method:

```python
class Worker(object):
    """
    Structure for tracking worker activity and keeping their references.
    """
    
    def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
        self.id = worker_id
        self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
        self.last_active = 0 if last_active is None else last_active  # seconds since epoch, default to 0 if last_active is None
        self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        self.tasks = set()  # task objects
        self.info = {}
```

By setting `self.last_active` to 0 if `last_active` is `None`, we ensure that it is always an integer value before performing addition with `config.worker_disconnect_delay` in the `prune` method. This modification will prevent the `TypeError` that was observed in the failing test.
