## Analysis
1. The issue is with the `prune` method that is trying to calculate the time difference between the `last_active` time of the worker and the current time using the `config.worker_disconnect_delay`. However, the `last_active` attribute is initialized with a default value of `None`, which causes a `TypeError` when trying to calculate time difference with an integer.
   
2. The bug is located in the `prune` method where the `last_active` attribute is used without proper validation or initialization check.

## Bug Cause
The bug occurs because the `last_active` attribute is initialized as `None` in the `__init__` method of the `Worker` class. When the `prune` method is called on a worker object, it tries to perform arithmetic operations (addition) between `None` and an integer value (config.worker_disconnect_delay + time.time()), which results in a `TypeError`.

## Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to add a validation check in the `prune` method to handle the case where the `last_active` attribute is `None`. We can set a default value for `last_active` if it is `None` before performing any arithmetic operations.

## Corrected Version
```python
class Worker(object):
    """
    Structure for tracking worker activity and keeping their references.
    """

    def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
        self.id = worker_id
        self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
        self.last_active = last_active
        self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        self.tasks = set()  # task objects
        self.info = {}

    def prune(self, config):
        if self.last_active is None:
            return
        
        if self.last_active + config.worker_disconnect_delay < time.time():
            # Perform pruning operations here
            pass
```

In the corrected version, before calculating the time difference in the `prune` method, we check if `self.last_active` is `None`. If it is `None`, the method simply returns without attempting any arithmetic operations. This change ensures that the method can handle cases where `last_active` was not properly set.
