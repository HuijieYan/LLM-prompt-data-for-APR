### Analysis:
1. The function `__init__` of the `Worker` class is missing the necessary initialization for the `last_active` attribute.
2. The test function `test_worker_prune_after_init` is expecting the `prune` method of the `Worker` object to work correctly, but since `last_active` is `None`, it causes an error when trying to add an integer to it.
3. The error message clearly indicates that the bug is due to trying to add an integer to a `NoneType`.
4. To fix the bug, we need to set a default value for `last_active` or handle the case where it is `None` when adding the time component.

### Correction:
Here is the corrected version of the `__init__` method in the `Worker` class:

```python
class Worker(object):
    """
    Structure for tracking worker activity and keeping their references.
    """

    def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
        self.id = worker_id
        self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
        self.last_active = last_active if last_active is not None else time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        self.tasks = set()  # task objects
        self.info = {}
```

By checking if `last_active` is `None` and setting it to the current time in that case, we ensure that there are no `NoneType` errors when trying to add the time component for comparison.

After applying this fix, the `test_worker_prune_after_init` should pass successfully without any errors.
