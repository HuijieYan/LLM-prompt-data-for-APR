The bug in the `Worker` class is related to the `last_active` attribute being initialized as `None` and not being handled properly in the `prune` method. 

### Potential Error Location:
- The `last_active` attribute is initialized as `None` in the `__init__` method of the `Worker` class.

### Cause of the Bug:
- The `prune` method is trying to perform an addition operation between `self.last_active` (which is `None`) and `config.worker_disconnect_delay` (an integer), resulting in a `TypeError`.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
- To fix this issue, the `last_active` attribute should be initialized with a valid timestamp value instead of `None` in the `__init__` method. 

### Corrected Version of the `__init__` method:
```python
def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
    self.id = worker_id
    self.reference = None
    self.last_active = last_active if last_active is not None else time.time() # Initialize with current time if None
    self.started = time.time()
    self.tasks = set()
    self.info = {}
```

After fixing the `__init__` method, the `Worker` class will now properly initialize the `last_active` attribute with the current timestamp if None is passed during object creation.

The corrected version should pass the failing test without any `TypeError`.
