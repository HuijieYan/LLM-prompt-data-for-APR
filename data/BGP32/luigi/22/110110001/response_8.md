## Analysis
1. The buggy function is the `__init__` method of the `Worker` class in the `luigi/scheduler.py` file.
2. The test function `test_worker_prune_after_init` tries to create a worker object and then call the `prune` method on it with a temporary configuration object.
3. The error message indicates that there is a `TypeError` because the `self.last_active` attribute is `NoneType`, and an integer value is being added to it in the `prune` method.
4. The bug occurs because the `last_active` parameter in the `__init__` method is not initialized correctly if no `last_active` value is provided when creating a `Worker` object. To fix this bug, we need to handle the case where `last_active` is `None` and set it to a default value, such as `0`, in the `__init__` method.

## Fixes
1. Update the `__init__` method of the `Worker` class to handle the case where `last_active` is `None`.
2. Set a default value of `0` for `last_active` if it is not provided.
3. Ensure that the `self.last_active` attribute is correctly initialized in the `__init__` method to avoid the `TypeError` when calling the `prune` method.

## Corrected Version of the Worker class
```python
class Worker(object):
    """
    Structure for tracking worker activity and keeping their references.
    """

    def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
        self.id = worker_id
        self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
        self.last_active = last_active if last_active is not None else 0  # seconds since epoch
        self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        self.tasks = set()  # task objects
        self.info = {}
```

By updating the `__init__` method as shown above, the `last_active` attribute of the `Worker` class will be properly initialized even if no value is provided when creating a `Worker` object. This will prevent the `TypeError` that was occurring in the `prune` method.
