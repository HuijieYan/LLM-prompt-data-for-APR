### Analysis:
1. The `Worker` class in `luigi/scheduler.py` has a buggy `__init__` function that initializes a worker object with a worker ID and last active timestamp (which defaults to `None`).
2. The failing test `test_worker_prune_after_init` in `test/scheduler_test.py` creates a worker object and tries to call the `prune` method on it, passing a `TmpCfg` object as a parameter.
3. The `prune` method in the `Worker` class is comparing `self.last_active` (which could be `None`) with an integer value calculated based on the configuration, leading to a `TypeError` when attempting to add `None` and an integer.
4. To fix the bug, we need to ensure that `self.last_active` is always initialized to a valid integer value, either by using a default value or initializing it within the `__init__` function.

### Strategy for fixing the bug:
1. Modify the `__init__` method of the `Worker` class to initialize `self.last_active` to 0 if it is not provided during object creation.
2. This will ensure that `self.last_active` is always a valid integer value, preventing the `TypeError` when comparing it with other integer values.

### Corrected version of the `Worker` class:
```python
class Worker(object):
    """
    Structure for tracking worker activity and keeping their references.
    """

    def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
        self.id = worker_id
        self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
        self.last_active = last_active if last_active is not None else 0  # seconds since epoch, default to 0 if None
        self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        self.tasks = set()  # task objects
        self.info = {}
```

By initializing `self.last_active` to 0 if it is not provided during object creation, the corrected version ensures that the comparison in the `prune` method will not result in a `TypeError`. This fix should resolve the issue and allow the failing test to pass.
