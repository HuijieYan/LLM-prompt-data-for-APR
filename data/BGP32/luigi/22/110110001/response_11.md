### Analysis:
1. The buggy function is the `__init__` method of the `Worker` class in the `luigi.scheduler` module.
2. The failing test `test_worker_prune_after_init` is trying to create a new `Worker` object and then call the `prune` method on it with a custom configuration object.
3. The error message indicates a `TypeError` when trying to add `self.last_active` (which is initialized to `None`) to an integer value (config.worker_disconnect_delay). This error occurs because `self.last_active` is not being properly handled or initialized in the `__init__` method.
4. To fix the bug, we need to modify the `__init__` method to handle the case where `last_active` is None and ensure it is initialized correctly to avoid the TypeError.

### Bugs and Fixes:
1. The `last_active` attribute of the `Worker` class is initialized to `None` but it is used in calculations in the `prune` function, leading to a `TypeError`.
2. Initialize `last_active` in a valid way to avoid `NoneType` errors.

### Corrected Version:
Here is the corrected version of the `__init__` method:

```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: luigi/scheduler.py

# The declaration of the class after fixing the bug
class Worker(object):
    """
    Structure for tracking worker activity and keeping their references.
    """

    def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
        self.id = worker_id
        self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
        self.last_active = last_active if last_active is not None else time.time()
        self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        self.tasks = set()  # task objects
        self.info = {}
```

With this correction, the `last_active` attribute is initialized using the current time if its value is `None`. This change ensures that there won't be any `NoneType` errors when performing arithmetic operations on `last_active` in the `prune` function.
