The bug in the provided code is due to the `last_active` attribute being initialized as `None` in the `__init__` method of the `Worker` class. This causes a `TypeError` when trying to perform arithmetic operation with `None` and an integer in the `prune` method.

## Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that `last_active` is always initialized with a valid timestamp (as an integer) in the `__init__` method of the `Worker` class.

## Corrected Version of the `__init__` Method:
```python
def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
    self.id = worker_id
    self.reference = None
    self.last_active = last_active if last_active is not None else time.time()  # Initialize last_active with current time if not provided
    self.started = time.time()
    self.tasks = set()
    self.info = {}
```

With this modification, the `last_active` attribute will default to the current time if no value is provided during object instantiation.

By making this change, the corrected version of the `Worker` class will now handle cases where `last_active` is not provided correctly and prevent the `TypeError` encountered in the failing test case.
