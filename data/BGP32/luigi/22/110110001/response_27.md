### Analysis:
1. The buggy function is the `__init__` method of the `Worker` class in `luigi/scheduler.py`.
2. The error occurs in the `prune` method of the `Worker` class when trying to calculate if a worker should be deleted based on the last active time and a worker disconnect delay.
3. The error message indicates a `TypeError` due to trying to add `NoneType` to an integer in the condition of the `prune` method.
4. The bug is caused by not handling the case where `last_active` is `None` in the initialization of the `Worker` object.
5. To fix the bug, we need to handle the case where `last_active` is `None` in the `__init__` method and possibly provide a default value for it.

### Suggestions to Fix the Bug:
1. Provide a default value for `last_active` in case it is not provided during initialization.
2. Convert `last_active` to a default value (e.g., 0) if it is `None`.

### Corrected Version of the `__init__` method:
```python
# The declaration of the class containing the buggy function
class Worker(object):
    """
    Structure for tracking worker activity and keeping their references.
    """

    def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
        self.id = worker_id
        self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
        self.last_active = last_active if last_active is not None else 0  # seconds since epoch with default being 0
        self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        self.tasks = set()  # task objects
        self.info = {}
```

By modifying the `__init__` method as shown above, the bug should be fixed. The corrected version handles the case when `last_active` is `None`, preventing the `TypeError` when trying to compare it with an integer.
