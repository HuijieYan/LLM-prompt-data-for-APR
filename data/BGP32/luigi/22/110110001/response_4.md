### Analysis:
1. The buggy function is the `__init__` method of the `Worker` class in the `luigi.scheduler` module.
2. The error occurs in the line `self.last_active = last_active`, where `last_active` is set to `None`.
3. The failing test `test_worker_prune_after_init` tries to create a `Worker` object with `worker_id` 123 and then calls the `prune` method on it, passing a temporary configuration object. The error message indicates that the `TypeError` occurs due to trying to add `None` (self.last_active) with an integer (config.worker_disconnect_delay).
4. To fix the bug, we need to ensure that `self.last_active` is assigned a valid value in case `last_active` is `None`. We can set `self.last_active` to `time.time()` if `last_active` is not provided during initialization.
5. Below is the corrected version of the `__init__` method in the `Worker` class:

### Corrected Version:
```python
class Worker:
    """
    Structure for tracking worker activity and keeping their references.
    """

    def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
        self.id = worker_id
        self.reference = None
        self.last_active = time.time() if last_active is None else last_active
        self.started = time.time()
        self.tasks = set()
        self.info = {}
``` 

After applying this fix, the `Worker` object will have a valid `last_active` timestamp based on the given input value (or the current time if no value is provided). This corrected version should now pass the failing test.
