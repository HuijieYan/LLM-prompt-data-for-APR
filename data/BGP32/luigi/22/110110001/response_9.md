### Analysis:
1. The `Worker` class in `luigi/scheduler.py` has a constructor `__init__` method that initializes a worker instance with certain attributes like `id`, `reference`, `last_active`, `started`, `tasks`, and `info`.
2. The failing test `test_worker_prune_after_init` tries to create a `Worker` instance and then call the `prune` method on it with a configuration object.
3. The error message indicates that there is an issue with adding `NoneType` and `int` in the `prune` method.
4. The bug is likely caused by the `last_active` attribute being initialized to `None` in the constructor, which causes a type error when trying to add an `int` to `None`.
  
### Bug Cause:
The bug occurs because the `last_active` attribute in the `Worker` class is initialized to `None`. When the `prune` method is called with a configuration object that has `worker_disconnect_delay`, it attempts to add an integer value to `None`, resulting in a `TypeError`.

### Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the `last_active` attribute is initialized to a default value if it is not provided during object creation. It should default to the time when the worker was started in case no initial last active time is provided.

### Corrected Version:
```python
class Worker(object):
    """
    Structure for tracking worker activity and keeping their references.
    """

    def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
        self.id = worker_id
        self.reference = None
        self.last_active = last_active if last_active is not None else time.time()  # Default to current time if not provided
        self.started = time.time()
        self.tasks = set()
        self.info = {}

    def prune(self, config):
        if self.last_active + config.worker_disconnect_delay < time.time():
            # Perform pruning operations here
            pass
``` 

With this corrected version, the `last_active` attribute is initialized to the current time when no initial last active time is provided, preventing the `TypeError` when trying to add an integer to `None`.
