### Analyzing the issue:
The buggy function is `__init__` in the `Worker` class in `luigi/scheduler.py` file. The failing test `test_worker_prune_after_init` is trying to instantiate a `Worker` object with an `id`, and then call the `prune` method on it passing a configuration object with a `worker_disconnect_delay` attribute. The error occurs when trying to calculate the time elapsed since the worker was last active, which results in a `TypeError` due to adding `NoneType` and `int` types together.

### Potential error location:
The issue is most likely with the `last_active` attribute being `None` when it is initialized in the constructor.

### Cause of the bug:
The bug occurs because the `last_active` attribute in the `Worker` class is set to `None` by default and then used in calculations without any check for `None` values. This causes the `TypeError` when trying to add an integer to `None`.

### Strategy for fixing the bug:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that `last_active` is always initialized to a numeric value rather than `None`. One approach could be to set a default value for `last_active` in the constructor.

### The corrected version of the buggy function:
```python
class Worker(object):
    """
    Structure for tracking worker activity and keeping their references.
    """
    def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
        self.id = worker_id
        self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
        self.last_active = last_active if last_active is not None else time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        self.tasks = set()  # task objects
        self.info = {}
```

### With this correction, the `last_active` attribute in the `Worker` class will be initialized to the current time if no specific value is provided, ensuring that it is always a valid numeric value. This change should fix the `TypeError` issue encountered in the failing test.
