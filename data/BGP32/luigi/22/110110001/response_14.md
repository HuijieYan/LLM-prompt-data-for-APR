The bug in the `__init__` function of the `Worker` class occurs due to the `last_active` parameter being set to `None` by default when passed as an argument. This causes the error when trying to perform arithmetic operations on `None` with integers in the `prune` method.

To fix this bug, you should initialize `self.last_active` to a default value of `0` in the `__init__` function to ensure it always contains a valid value for comparison in the `prune` method.

Here is the corrected version of the `Worker` class:

```python
class Worker(object):
    """
    Structure for tracking worker activity and keeping their references.
    """

    def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=0):
        self.id = worker_id
        self.reference = None
        self.last_active = last_active
        self.started = time.time()
        self.tasks = set()
        self.info = {}

    def prune(self, config):
        if self.last_active + config.worker_disconnect_delay < time.time():
            # Perform pruning actions here
            pass
```

By setting `last_active=0` in the `__init__` function, we ensure that `self.last_active` always contains a valid integer value. This change will prevent the `TypeError` that was occurring due to trying to add `None` and an integer in the `prune` method when calling `worker.prune(TmpCfg())`.
