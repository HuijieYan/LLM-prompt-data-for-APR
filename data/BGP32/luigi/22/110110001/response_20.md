### Analysis:
1. The buggy function is the `__init__` method of the `Worker` class in the `luigi.scheduler` module.
2. The error in the failing test occurs in the `prune` method when attempting to compare `self.last_active` (which can be `None`) with an integer. This results in a `TypeError`.
3. The root cause of the bug is that `self.last_active` can be `None` in the `Worker` initialization, which causes issues when attempting to perform arithmetic operations on it.
4. To fix the bug, we need to handle the case where `last_active` is not provided during worker initialization.

### Fixed Version:
```python
class Worker:
    """
    Structure for tracking worker activity and keeping their references.
    """
    
    def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
        self.id = worker_id
        self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
        self.last_active = last_active  # seconds since epoch
        self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        self.tasks = set()  # task objects
        self.info = {}
        
        if self.last_active is None:
            self.last_active = self.started
```

By checking if `last_active` is `None` and setting it to `self.started` if it is, we ensure that `last_active` will always have a valid value for the comparison in the `prune` method. This modification will prevent the `TypeError` when calculating `self.last_active + config.worker_disconnect_delay` in the `prune` method.
