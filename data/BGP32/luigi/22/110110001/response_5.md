### Analysis:
- The buggy function is the `__init__` method of the `Worker` class from the `luigi.scheduler` module.
- The error is occurring in the `worker.prune()` method call in the test code due to an unsupported operation in the `prune()` method.
- The error message points out that the `self.last_active` attribute is of type `NoneType` and is causing the issue when trying to add an integer to it.

### Potential Error Locations:
- The issue lies in the `__init__` method of the `Worker` class. The `last_active` parameter is set to `None`, causing the `self.last_active` attribute to be `None`.
- When trying to calculate `self.last_active + config.worker_disconnect_delay`, the addition operation fails due to the `NoneType` of `self.last_active`.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is caused by initializing the `last_active` attribute of the `Worker` class as `None`. This causes a `TypeError` when trying to add an integer value to `None`. In the test code, `worker.prune()` method is accessed, expecting `self.last_active` to be a valid epoch time.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, initialize `last_active` with the current time (seconds since epoch) in the `__init__` method. This will ensure that `last_active` is always a valid integer value and prevent the `TypeError` when performing operations on it.

### Corrected Version of the Buggy Function:
```python
class Worker(object):
    """
    Structure for tracking worker activity and keeping their references.
    """

    def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
        self.id = worker_id
        self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
        self.last_active = last_active if last_active is not None else time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        self.tasks = set()  # task objects
        self.info = {}
```

By initializing `last_active` with the current time if it is `None`, the corrected version ensures that `last_active` is always an integer value. This modification should fix the bug and allow the `worker.prune()` method to work correctly.
