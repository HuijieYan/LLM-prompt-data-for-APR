### Analaysis:
1. The buggy function is the `__init__` method of the `Worker` class in the `luigi.scheduler` module.
2. The bug is causing a `TypeError` during the execution of the `prune` method in the failing test.
3. The bug is due to the initialization of `self.last_active = last_active` without considering the case where `last_active` might be `None` initially.
4. To fix the bug, we need to handle the case where `last_active` is `None` by setting a default value of `0` in the `__init__` method.

### Bug Fix:
Here is the corrected version of the `__init__` method in the `Worker` class:

```python
class Worker(object):
    """
    Structure for tracking worker activity and keeping their references.
    """

    def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
        self.id = worker_id
        self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
        self.last_active = last_active if last_active is not None else 0  # seconds since epoch
        self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        self.tasks = set()  # task objects
        self.info = {}
```

By setting `self.last_active = last_active if last_active is not None else 0`, we ensure that even if `last_active` is initially set to `None`, it will be overridden with `0` during the initialization of the `Worker` object. This change will prevent the `TypeError` from occurring during the `prune` method call.
