### Analysis:
- **Buggy Function**: The `__init__` method of the `Worker` class is supposed to initialize the worker object with the provided `worker_id`, along with optional parameters like `last_active`. However, there is an issue with the initialization of `last_active` and calculation of `started` time.
- **Buggy Class**: The `Worker` class in the `luigi.scheduler` module is designed to track worker activity and keep references to workers.
- **Failing Test**: The failing test `test_worker_prune_after_init` tries to create a `Worker` object and then call the `prune` method on it, passing a temporary configuration object as an argument.
- **Error Message**: The error occurs when the `prune` method tries to calculate if a worker should be pruned based on the last active time and a configuration parameter. It fails due to an unsupported operand type error when trying to add `NoneType` (unset `last_active`) with an integer.
  
### Bug Cause:
- The bug is due to the `last_active` attribute being initialized as `None` in the `__init__` method, and then the `prune` method tries to perform arithmetic operations on it without handling the case where it might be `None`.
  
### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
- We need to handle the case where `last_active` is `None` gracefully in the `prune` method to prevent the TypeError.
- We can default `last_active` to `time.time()` in the `__init__` method if it is not provided by the user.

### Corrected Version:
```python
class Worker(object):
    """
    Structure for tracking worker activity and keeping their references.
    """

    def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
        self.id = worker_id
        self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
        self.last_active = last_active if last_active is not None else time.time()
        self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        self.tasks = set()  # task objects
        self.info = {}

    def prune(self, config):
        if self.last_active is not None and self.last_active + config.worker_disconnect_delay < time.time():
            # Perform pruning operation
            pass
```

By defaulting `last_active` to `time.time()` if it is not provided, we ensure that calculations involving `last_active` in the `prune` method do not result in TypeError due to unsupported operand types. This correction should fix the bug and allow the test to pass.
