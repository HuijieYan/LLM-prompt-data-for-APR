### Analysis:
1. The buggy function is the `__init__` method of the `Worker` class in the `luigi/scheduler.py` file.
2. The test function `test_worker_prune_after_init` is trying to create an instance of `Worker` and call the `prune` method which is intended to check if the worker has been inactive for a certain period of time.
3. The error occurs because `self.last_active` is initialized with a default value of `None` in the `__init__` method, causing a `TypeError` when trying to add it to an integer value (`time.time()`).
   
### Bug Cause:
The bug is caused by `self.last_active` being initialized to `None` in the `__init__` method of the `Worker` class, which leads to a `TypeError` when trying to add an integer value to `None` in the `prune` method.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, the `last_active` parameter should be set to a default value of `0` instead of `None` in the `__init__` method. This way, the method `prune` can safely check the inactivity of the worker without causing any `TypeError`.

### Corrected Version:
```python
class Worker(object):
    """
    Structure for tracking worker activity and keeping their references.
    """

    def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=0):
        self.id = worker_id
        self.reference = None
        self.last_active = last_active
        self.started = time.time()
        self.tasks = set()
        self.info = {}

    def prune(self, config):
        if self.last_active + config.worker_disconnect_delay < time.time():
            # Perform pruning logic here
            pass
```

By setting the default value of `last_active` to `0` instead of `None` in the `__init__` method, the corrected version should resolve the `TypeError` issue and allow the `prune` method to function correctly.
