## Bug Explanation
The bug in the given code is that the `last_active` parameter in the `__init__` function is not being properly initialized. The `last_active` parameter is passed as `None`, but then the value assigned to `self.last_active` is the current time using `time.time()`. This results in `last_active` being overwritten with the current time instead of using the provided `last_active` value.

## Fix Strategy
To fix this bug, we need to check if `last_active` is provided, and only update `self.last_active` with the current time if it is not provided. This will ensure that the `last_active` value is correctly initialized either with the provided value or the current time.

## The corrected version of the buggy function
```python
import time

# The declaration of the class containing the corrected function
class Worker(object):
    """
    Structure for tracking worker activity and keeping their references.
    """

    def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
        self.id = worker_id
        self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
        if last_active is not None:
            self.last_active = last_active
        else:
            self.last_active = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        self.tasks = set()  # task objects
        self.info = {}

    def prune(self, config):
        # Your implementation here
```

By making this change, the `last_active` parameter in the `__init__` function will be properly initialized either with the provided value or with the current time if no value is provided. This corrected version should now pass the failing test.
