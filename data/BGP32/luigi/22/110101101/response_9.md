## Fixing the bug

### Bug Explanation
The bug occurs in the `__init__` method of the `Worker` class. The issue is that the `last_active` parameter is not properly assigned to the `self.last_active` attribute. In the buggy code, `last_active` is passed but not assigned correctly. This results in `self.last_active` having the default value of `None` instead of the actual value passed in.

### Fix Strategy
To fix this bug, we need to correctly assign the `last_active` parameter to the `self.last_active` attribute in the `__init__` method.

### Corrected Version

```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: luigi/scheduler.py

# The declaration of the class containing the buggy function
class Worker(object):
    """
    Structure for tracking worker activity and keeping their references.
    """

    def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
        self.id = worker_id
        self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
        self.last_active = last_active if last_active is not None else time.time()  # assign last_active or current time if None
        self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        self.tasks = set()  # task objects
        self.info = {}
```

By making the adjustment to check if `last_active` is provided and assigning it appropriately, the bug is fixed. Now the `last_active` parameter will be correctly assigned to the `self.last_active` attribute. This corrected version should pass the failing test case provided.
