## Explanation
The bug in the `__init__` method of the `Worker` class is that the `last_active` parameter is not correctly assigned when provided during initialization. This results in `last_active` being set as `None` even if a value is passed to it.

## Fix
To fix the bug, we need to assign the `last_active` parameter correctly in the `__init__` method.

## The corrected version of the buggy function
```python
class Worker(object):
    """
    Structure for tracking worker activity and keeping their references.
    """

    def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
        self.id = worker_id
        self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
        self.last_active = last_active if last_active is not None else time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        self.tasks = set()  # task objects
        self.info = {}
``` 

By updating the initialization of `self.last_active` to use the provided `last_active` parameter if it is not `None`, we ensure that the correct value is set during object creation, fixing the bug and making the function behave as expected.
