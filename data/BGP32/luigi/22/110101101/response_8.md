The bug in the `__init__` method of the `Worker` class is that it is not correctly initializing the `last_active` attribute. It is supposed to set the `last_active` attribute to the provided `last_active` parameter if one is passed, otherwise it should default to `None`.

To fix this bug, we need to update the initialization of the `last_active` attribute in the `__init__` method of the `Worker` class.

Here is the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
class Worker(object):
    """
    Structure for tracking worker activity and keeping their references.
    """

    def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
        self.id = worker_id
        self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
        self.last_active = last_active if last_active is not None else None  # seconds since epoch
        self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        self.tasks = set()  # task objects
        self.info = {}
```

With this correction, the `last_active` attribute will be correctly initialized based on the provided parameter, and the failing test `test_worker_prune_after_init` should pass as expected.
