The bug in the provided function is that the `last_active` parameter in the `__init__` method is not correctly assigned. The `last_active` parameter is passed to the method, but then it is not used in the assignment to `self.last_active`. This results in `last_active` being `None` instead of the intended value.

To fix this bug, we need to make sure that the `last_active` parameter is properly assigned to `self.last_active` in the `__init__` method.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
class Worker(object):
    """
    Structure for tracking worker activity and keeping their references.
    """

    def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
        self.id = worker_id
        self.reference = None  
        self.last_active = last_active if last_active is not None else time.time()
        self.started = time.time()  
        self.tasks = set()  
        self.info = {}
```

With this correction, the `last_active` parameter will be correctly assigned to `self.last_active` if a specific value is provided during initialization. Otherwise, it will default to the current time. This ensures that the expected behavior is met and the failing test will pass.
