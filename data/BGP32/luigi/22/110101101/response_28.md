The bug in the `__init__` function of the `Worker` class is that the `last_active` parameter is incorrectly assigned. It should be assigned to the `last_active` attribute of the class instead of directly to `self.last_active`.

To fix this bug, we need to change the assignment of `last_active` in the `__init__` function to correctly update the `self.last_active` attribute.

Here is the corrected version of the `__init__` function:
```python
def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
    self.id = worker_id
    self.reference = None
    self.last_active = last_active if last_active is not None else time.time()  # Assign either the provided last_active or the current time
    self.started = time.time()
    self.tasks = set()
    self.info = {}
```

With this correction, the `last_active` parameter will now correctly update the `self.last_active` attribute in the `Worker` class.

This corrected version should pass the failing test case provided.
