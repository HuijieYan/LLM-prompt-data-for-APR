The bug in the given code is that the `last_active` parameter in the `__init__` function is not properly assigned, leading to it being set as `None` by default. This causes issues when trying to access it later in the `prune` method, resulting in a failure during the test.

To fix this bug, we need to properly assign the `last_active` parameter in the `__init__` function. We can use the default value approach to set it to the current time if no explicit value is provided.

Here is the corrected version of the `__init__` function:

```python
def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
    self.id = worker_id
    self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
    
    if last_active is None:
        self.last_active = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
    else:
        self.last_active = last_active
    
    self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
    self.tasks = set()  # task objects
    self.info = {}
```

With this correction, the `last_active` parameter will be correctly assigned either to the provided value or to the current time if no value is specified. This will ensure that the test `test_worker_prune_after_init` executes successfully with the expected values.
