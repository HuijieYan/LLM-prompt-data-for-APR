The bug in the `__init__` method of the `Worker` class is that the `last_active` parameter is not being assigned to `self.last_active` correctly. It's being assigned directly to the `last_active` attribute instead of `self.last_active`. 

To fix the bug, we need to update the assignment of `last_active` in the `__init__` method to `self.last_active = last_active` instead of `last_active = last_active`.

Here is the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: luigi/scheduler.py

# The corrected class containing the bug-fixed function
class Worker(object):
    """
    Structure for tracking worker activity and keeping their references.
    """

    def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
        self.id = worker_id
        self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
        self.last_active = last_active  # seconds since epoch
        self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        self.tasks = set()  # task objects
        self.info = {}
```

With this correction, the `last_active` parameter will be correctly assigned to `self.last_active` in the `Worker` class. This will ensure that the expected values are set correctly and the failing test `test_worker_prune_after_init` will pass successfully.
