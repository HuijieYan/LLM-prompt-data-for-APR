## Bug Explanation
The bug in the `Worker` class `__init__` function is that the `last_active` parameter is not being properly assigned. The `last_active` parameter is not being initialized correctly, resulting in it keeping the default value of `None` instead of being set to the actual value passed during object creation.

## Fix Strategy
To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the `last_active` parameter provided during object creation is properly assigned to the `self.last_active` attribute inside the `__init__` function.

## Corrected Version
```python
class Worker(object):
    """
    Structure for tracking worker activity and keeping their references.
    """

    def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
        self.id = worker_id
        self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
        self.last_active = last_active if last_active is not None else time.time()  # seconds since epoch or current time if not provided
        self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        self.tasks = set()  # task objects
        self.info = {}
``` 

After applying this fix, the `last_active` attribute will be set to the provided value during object creation if it is not `None`. Otherwise, it will default to the current time using `time.time()`. This corrected version should pass the failing test case mentioned.
