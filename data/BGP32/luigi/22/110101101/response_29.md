The bug in the provided function is that the `last_active` parameter, which is meant to default to None if not provided, is not correctly assigned to the `last_active` instance variable in the `__init__` method. This leads to the wrong initialization of the `last_active` variable.

To fix the bug, we need to properly assign the `last_active` parameter to the `self.last_active` variable in the `__init__` method.

Here is the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
class Worker(object):
    """
    Structure for tracking worker activity and keeping their references.
    """

    def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
        self.id = worker_id
        self.reference = None
        self.last_active = last_active if last_active is not None else time.time()
        self.started = time.time()
        self.tasks = set()
        self.info = {}
```

With this correction, the `last_active` parameter will default to the current time using `time.time()` if not provided, aligning with the expected behavior described in the failing test case.
