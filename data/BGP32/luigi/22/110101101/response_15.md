## Bug Explanation
The bug in the `Worker` class `__init__` function is that the `last_active` parameter is not being correctly assigned to the instance variable `self.last_active`. The `last_active` parameter is passed to the function but not used in the assignment, resulting in `self.last_active` being initialized to `None` which is not the same as the provided `last_active` value.

## Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to assign the `last_active` parameter to `self.last_active` during the initialization of the `Worker` instance.

## The corrected version of the buggy function
```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: luigi/scheduler.py

# The declaration of the class containing the buggy function
class Worker(object):
    """
    Structure for tracking worker activity and keeping their references.
    """

    def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
        self.id = worker_id
        self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
        self.last_active = last_active  # Assign the last_active parameter to self.last_active
        self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        self.tasks = set()  # task objects
        self.info = {}
```

By making this correction, the `last_active` parameter will now correctly initialize the `self.last_active` instance variable, resolving the bug.
