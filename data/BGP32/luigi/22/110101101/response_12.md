The bug in the provided function is that the `last_active` parameter is not propagated correctly and remains `None` in the `__init__` method of the Worker class. This causes the `last_active` attribute to be incorrectly initialized as `None` instead of the expected value. 

To fix this bug, we need to update the `__init__` method to correctly assign the `last_active` parameter to the `self.last_active` attribute.

Here is the corrected version of the `__init__` method:

```python
def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
    self.id = worker_id
    self.reference = None
    self.last_active = last_active if last_active is not None else time.time()  # assigning last_active or current time
    self.started = time.time()
    self.tasks = set()
    self.info = {}
```

By updating the assignment of `self.last_active`, we ensure that if a specific `last_active` value is provided during initialization, it will be used, otherwise the current time will be set as the default value.

This corrected version of the function should pass the failing test by correctly initializing the `last_active` attribute.
