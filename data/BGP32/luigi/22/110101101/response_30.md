## Explanation
The bug in the `__init__` function of the `Worker` class is that the `last_active` parameter is not being assigned correctly. In the test function `test_worker_prune_after_init`, the `prune` method is being called on the `Worker` instance with an incorrect `worker_disconnect_delay` value. This causes a mismatch between the expected `last_active` value and the actual `last_active` value set in the `__init__` function.

## Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to adjust the way the `last_active` parameter is assigned in the `__init__` function to use the value passed in as an argument. This will make sure that the expected values align with the actual values set during the test execution.

## The corrected version of the buggy function
```python
class Worker(object):
    """
    Structure for tracking worker activity and keeping their references.
    """

    def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
        self.id = worker_id
        self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
        if last_active is None:
            self.last_active = time.time()
        else:
            self.last_active = last_active
        self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        self.tasks = set()  # task objects
        self.info = {}
```

By modifying the initialization of `self.last_active` in the `__init__` function to use the passed `last_active` parameter if it is not `None`, we ensure that the correct value is assigned. This correction should now pass the failing test `test_worker_prune_after_init`.
