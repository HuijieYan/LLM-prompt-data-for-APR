The bug in the `__init__` function of the `Worker` class is that it incorrectly initializes the `last_active` attribute. Instead of assigning the input parameter value to `last_active`, it is being directly assigned to the `self.id`, resulting in unexpected behavior in the test cases.

To fix this bug, we need to update the assignment of the `last_active` attribute in the `__init__` function to correctly set it to the input parameter `last_active`.

Here is the corrected version of the `__init__` function:

```python
class Worker(object):
    """
    Structure for tracking worker activity and keeping their references.
    """

    def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
        self.id = worker_id
        self.reference = None
        self.last_active = last_active if last_active is not None else time.time()  # Initialize last_active based on input or current time
        self.started = time.time()
        self.tasks = set()
        self.info = {}
```

With this correction, the test case `test_worker_prune_after_init` should now pass as the `last_active` attribute will be correctly initialized either with the input `last_active` or the current time if no input was provided.
