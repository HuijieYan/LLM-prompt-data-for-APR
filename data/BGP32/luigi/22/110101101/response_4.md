The bug in the `__init__` method of the `Worker` class is that the `last_active` parameter is not being assigned properly to the `last_active` instance variable. Instead, it is directly assigning the `last_active` parameter to `self.last_active`. The `last_active` parameter should be used to initialize the `last_active` instance variable.

To fix the bug, modify the `__init__` method to properly assign the `last_active` parameter to `self.last_active`.

Here is the corrected version of the `__init__` method:

```python
# The corrected version of the buggy function
class Worker(object):
    """
    Structure for tracking worker activity and keeping their references.
    """

    def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
        self.id = worker_id
        self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
        self.last_active = last_active if last_active is not None else time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        self.tasks = set()  # task objects
        self.info = {}
```

With this correction, the test `test_worker_prune_after_init` should now pass as the initialization of `last_active` will be done correctly.
