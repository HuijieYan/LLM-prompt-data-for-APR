## Bug Analysis
The buggy function is supposed to initialize a Worker object with an id, last_active timestamp, and other attributes. However, in the provided failing test `test_worker_prune_after_init`, the `prune` method is called on the Worker object, which implies that there should be a method named `prune` in the Worker class.

The issue arises because the `prune` method is missing from the Worker class, causing the failing test to raise an AttributeError.

## Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to add the `prune` method to the Worker class. Additionally, we need to ensure that this method functions correctly and handles the input parameters as expected.

## The corrected version of the buggy function
```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: luigi/scheduler.py

# The declaration of the class containing the corrected function
class Worker(object):
    """
    Structure for tracking worker activity and keeping their references.
    """

    def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
        self.id = worker_id
        self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
        self.last_active = last_active  # seconds since epoch
        self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        self.tasks = set()  # task objects
        self.info = {}

    # Corrected prune method
    def prune(self, config):
        current_time = time.time()
        if self.last_active is not None and current_time - self.last_active > config.worker_disconnect_delay:
            self.reference = None
            self.last_active = None
            self.tasks.clear()
```

With the provided corrected version of the `Worker` class including the `prune` method, the failing test should now pass as expected.
