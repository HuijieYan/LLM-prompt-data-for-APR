The issue in the buggy function is that the `last_active` parameter is not being assigned correctly in the `__init__` function. The `last_active` parameter is passed as `None` but it should be set to the current time if it is `None` during initialization.

To fix this bug, we can modify the `__init__` function to check if `last_active` is `None` and assign the current time in that case. Here is the corrected version of the `__init__` function:

```python
def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
    self.id = worker_id
    self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
    self.last_active = last_active if last_active is not None else time.time()  # seconds since epoch
    self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
    self.tasks = set()  # task objects
    self.info = {}
```

With this correction, the `last_active` parameter will be properly initialized with the current time if it is `None`. This should make the failing test `test_worker_prune_after_init` pass with the expected values.
