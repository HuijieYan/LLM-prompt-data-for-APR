The bug in the `__init__` method of the `Worker` class is that the `last_active` parameter is not properly assigned to the `self.last_active` attribute.

To fix this bug, we need to properly assign the `last_active` parameter to the `self.last_active` attribute.

Here is the corrected version of the `__init__` method in the `Worker` class:

```python
def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
    self.id = worker_id
    self.reference = None
    self.last_active = last_active if last_active is not None else time.time()  # fix the assignment of last_active
    self.started = time.time()
    self.tasks = set()
    self.info = {}
```

With this correction, the `last_active` parameter will be correctly assigned to the `self.last_active` attribute, and the test case `test_worker_prune_after_init` should pass with the expected values and types mentioned.
