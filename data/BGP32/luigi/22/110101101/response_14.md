The bug in the `__init__` method of the `Worker` class is that it is not correctly initializing the `last_active` attribute when it is provided as an argument. Instead, it always initializes `last_active` to `None`, even if a value is provided.

To fix this bug, we should update the `__init__` method to properly handle the `last_active` parameter when it is provided.

Here is the corrected version of the `__init__` method:

```python
def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
    self.id = worker_id
    self.reference = None 
    if last_active is not None:
        self.last_active = last_active
    else:
        self.last_active = time.time()  # initialize to current time if last_active is not provided
    self.started = time.time()  
    self.tasks = set()  
    self.info = {}
```

By checking if `last_active` is provided and initializing it accordingly, the corrected `__init__` method will now properly set the `last_active` attribute based on the input parameter.

This fix will ensure that the `last_active` attribute is correctly initialized when provided, meeting the expected behavior.
