## Analysis
The buggy function `__init__` in the `Worker` class is not correctly setting the `last_active` parameter. It is always set to `None` regardless of the input value. This causes the failing test scenario where it expects `last_active` to be `1709218610.8782065`, but it remains `None`.

## Bug Cause
The bug is caused by the incorrect initialization of the `last_active` attribute in the `__init__` function of the `Worker` class. The `last_active` attribute should be set to the passed `last_active` parameter value, but it is always set to `None`.

## Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to modify the `__init__` function in the `Worker` class to correctly initialize the `last_active` attribute with the provided `last_active` parameter value.

## Corrected Version
```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: luigi/scheduler.py

# The declaration of the class containing the corrected function
class Worker(object):
    """
    Structure for tracking worker activity and keeping their references.
    """

    def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
        self.id = worker_id
        self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
        self.last_active = last_active if last_active is not None else time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        self.tasks = set()  # task objects
        self.info = {}
```

By updating the `__init__` function to properly initialize the `last_active` attribute with the provided value if it's not `None`, or with the current time if it is `None`, the corrected version should now pass the failing test scenario.
