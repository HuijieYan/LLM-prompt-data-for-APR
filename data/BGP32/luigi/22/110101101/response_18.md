The bug in the provided code is that the `last_active` parameter is not correctly assigned when the `Worker` object is initialized. The `last_active` parameter is intended to be set to the current time in seconds since epoch if no value is provided.

To fix this issue, we need to ensure that the `last_active` parameter is correctly initialized to the current time in seconds since epoch if it is not provided during object instantiation.

Here is the corrected version of the `Worker` class with the fixed initialization of the `last_active` parameter:

```python
class Worker(object):
    """
    Structure for tracking worker activity and keeping their references.
    """

    def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
        self.id = worker_id
        self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
        self.last_active = last_active if last_active is not None else time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        self.tasks = set()  # task objects
        self.info = {}
```

With this correction, the `last_active` parameter will now be properly initialized to the current time if no value is provided, ensuring that the test case `test_worker_prune_after_init` passes as expected.
