The bug in the `__init__` function of the `Worker` class is that the `last_active` parameter is not being correctly assigned to the `self.last_active` attribute. The `last_active` parameter is being correctly passed to the `__init__` function, but it is not stored in the `self.last_active` attribute.

To fix this bug, we need to assign the `last_active` parameter to the `self.last_active` attribute inside the `__init__` function.

Here is the corrected version of the `Worker` class with the fixed `__init__` function:

```python
import time

class Worker(object):
    """
    Structure for tracking worker activity and keeping their references.
    """

    def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
        self.id = worker_id
        self.reference = None
        self.last_active = last_active if last_active is not None else time.time()
        self.started = time.time()
        self.tasks = set()
        self.info = {}
```

With this correction, the `last_active` parameter will be correctly assigned to the `self.last_active` attribute if it is provided during initialization, otherwise the current time will be used.

This corrected version should now pass the failing test case provided above.
