The bug in the `__init__` method of the `Worker` class is that the `last_active` parameter is not correctly assigned to the `last_active` attribute. Instead, it initializes `last_active` with a default value of `None` and then assigns `time.time()` to `self.started`.

To fix this bug, we need to correctly assign the `last_active` parameter to the `last_active` attribute. Here is the corrected version of the `__init__` method:

```python
def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
    self.id = worker_id
    self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
    self.last_active = last_active if last_active is not None else time.time()  # seconds since epoch
    self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
    self.tasks = set()  # task objects
    self.info = {}
```

With this change, the `last_active` attribute will be assigned the provided `last_active` parameter value if it's not `None`, otherwise, it will default to the current time.

This corrected version of the `__init__` method should pass the failing test and satisfy the expected input/output values.
