The bug in the provided `__init__` method of the `Worker` class is that the `last_active` parameter is not being assigned correctly. It is always set to `None` and not the provided `last_active` value. 

To fix this bug, we need to update the `__init__` method to correctly assign the `last_active` parameter when it is provided.

Here is the corrected version:

```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: luigi/scheduler.py

# The declaration of the class containing the buggy function
class Worker(object):
    """
    Structure for tracking worker activity and keeping their references.
    """

    # Corrected version of the __init__ method
    def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
        self.id = worker_id
        self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
        self.last_active = last_active if last_active is not None else time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        self.tasks = set()  # task objects
        self.info = {}
```

With this correction, the `last_active` parameter will be properly assigned when provided, or default to the current time otherwise. This change should ensure that the `Worker` initialization behaves as expected and passes the failing test.
