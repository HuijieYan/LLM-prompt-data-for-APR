The bug in the provided `__init__` function of the `Worker` class is that it is not correctly initializing the `last_active` attribute with the provided `last_active` parameter. Instead, it is directly assigning the value of `None` to `self.last_active`.

### Cause of the Bug
The bug is caused because the `last_active` parameter provided to the `__init__` function is not being utilized to initialize the `last_active` attribute of the `Worker` class. This results in the `last_active` attribute retaining the default value of `None`, leading to the failing test.

### Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to correctly initialize the `last_active` attribute of the `Worker` class with the provided `last_active` parameter. This can be achieved by updating the assignment statement for `self.last_active`.

### Corrected Version of the Buggy Function
```python
class Worker(object):
    """
    Structure for tracking worker activity and keeping their references.
    """

    def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
        self.id = worker_id
        self.reference = None
        self.last_active = last_active if last_active is not None else time.time()
        self.started = time.time()
        self.tasks = set()
        self.info = {}
```

By updating the assignment of `self.last_active` to consider the provided `last_active` parameter, the corrected version of the function will now properly initialize the `last_active` attribute and pass the failing test.
