The bug in the `__init__` function of the `Worker` class is that the `last_active` parameter is not being assigned properly and it's defaulting to `None`. This causes the `last_active` value to not be updated correctly when a value is provided. 

To fix this bug, we need to properly assign the `last_active` parameter to the `self.last_active` attribute in the `__init__` function.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
class Worker(object):
    """
    Structure for tracking worker activity and keeping their references.
    """

    def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
        self.id = worker_id
        self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
        self.last_active = last_active if last_active is not None else time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        self.tasks = set()  # task objects
        self.info = {}
```

With this correction, the `last_active` parameter will be correctly assigned if a value is provided, or it will default to the current time when not provided.

This correction should make the failing test `test_worker_prune_after_init` pass successfully.
