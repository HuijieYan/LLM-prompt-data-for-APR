The issue in the buggy function is that the `last_active` parameter is not correctly assigned during initialization, leading to incorrect values during the test execution.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the `last_active` parameter is assigned properly to the `last_active` attribute in the `__init__` function.

Here is the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: luigi/scheduler.py

# The declaration of the class containing the buggy function
class Worker(object):
    """
    Structure for tracking worker activity and keeping their references.
    """

    def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
        self.id = worker_id
        self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
        self.last_active = last_active if last_active is not None else time.time()  # seconds since epoch or current time
        self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        self.tasks = set()  # task objects
        self.info = {}
```

With this correction, the `last_active` parameter will be correctly assigned during initialization, resolving the issue identified in the failing test. Now the `Worker` class should pass the failing test `test_worker_prune_after_init`.
