The bug in the current implementation is that the `last_active` parameter default value is set to `None` in the `__init__` method of the `Worker` class, but this value is not being used or assigned to the `last_active` attribute. Instead, the `last_active` attribute is being set to `time.time()` directly when the object is initialized. This leads to the `last_active` attribute having a different value than the one passed as a parameter.

To fix this bug, we should initialize the `last_active` attribute using the `last_active` parameter if it is provided, otherwise use the current time (`time.time()`).

Here is the corrected version of the Worker class:

```python
import time

class Worker(object):
    """
    Structure for tracking worker activity and keeping their references.
    """

    def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
        self.id = worker_id
        self.reference = None
        self.last_active = last_active if last_active else time.time()
        self.started = time.time()
        self.tasks = set()
        self.info = {}
```

With this correction, the issue of `last_active` not being properly initialized in the `__init__` method is resolved. This corrected version should now pass the failing test case provided.
