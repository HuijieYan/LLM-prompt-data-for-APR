The bug in the `__init__` function of the `Worker` class is that the `last_active` parameter is not being correctly assigned. It is being assigned to the parameter `last_active` instead of the expected input value, leading to incorrect behavior.

To fix this bug, we need to adjust the assignment of `last_active` inside the `__init__` function to correctly use the input parameter `last_active`.

Here is the corrected version of the `__init__` function:

```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: luigi/scheduler.py

# The declaration of the class containing the buggy function
class Worker(object):
    """
    Structure for tracking worker activity and keeping their references.
    """

    def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
        self.id = worker_id
        self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
        self.last_active = last_active if last_active is not None else time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        self.tasks = set()  # task objects
        self.info = {}
```

With this correction, the `last_active` parameter is now correctly assigned either the provided value or the current time if no value is provided, ensuring that the expected behavior is met.

This corrected version should now pass the failing test provided.
