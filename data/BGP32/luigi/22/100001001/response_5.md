The bug in the provided function is that the `last_active` parameter is not properly assigned when it is given as an argument. This results in `last_active` not being initialized correctly, potentially leading to incorrect behavior in the rest of the code that relies on this value.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the `__init__` function to correctly initialize the `last_active` attribute if a value is provided, or set it to `None` if no value is given. 

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
    self.id = worker_id
    self.reference = None  
    if last_active is not None:
        self.last_active = last_active
    else:
        self.last_active = None
    self.started = time.time()  
    self.tasks = set()  
    self.info = {}
```

By checking if `last_active` is provided and assigning it accordingly in the `__init__` function, we ensure that the attribute is initialized properly, fixing the bug.
