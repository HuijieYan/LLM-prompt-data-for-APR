### Explanation:
The issue in the buggy function is that it is missing the `self` parameter in its constructor, which is essential for defining class methods and accessing class attributes. Without the `self` parameter, the variables are not being initialized correctly, leading to unexpected behavior.

### Fix:
To correct this issue, we need to add the `self` parameter to the constructor method. Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
    self.id = worker_id
    self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
    self.last_active = last_active  # seconds since epoch
    self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
    self.tasks = set()  # task objects
    self.info = {}
```

By adding `self` as the first parameter in the method definition, the function will correctly initialize the class attributes and operate as expected.
