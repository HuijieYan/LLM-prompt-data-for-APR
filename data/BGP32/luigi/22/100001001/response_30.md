### Explanation
The bug in the provided function is that the `last_active` parameter is not being assigned properly. It should be initialized correctly when provided and default to `None` if not provided.

### Strategy for fixing the bug
To fix the bug, we need to check if the `last_active` parameter is provided when creating an instance of the class. If it is provided, we need to assign it to the instance variable `self.last_active`. If it is not provided, `None` should be assigned as the default value.

### Corrected version of the function
```python
def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
    self.id = worker_id
    self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
    self.last_active = last_active if last_active is not None else None  # seconds since epoch
    self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
    self.tasks = set()  # task objects
    self.info = {}
```  

By making this change, the function will properly initialize the `last_active` attribute based on the provided value or a default value of `None`.
