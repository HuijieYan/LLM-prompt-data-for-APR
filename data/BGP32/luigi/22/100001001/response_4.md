The issue in the provided code is that the `__init__` function uses the wrong argument name `worker_id` instead of `self` for the class instance. This means that the instance variables (`id`, `reference`, `last_active`, `started`, `tasks`, `info`) are being assigned to the local variable `worker_id` instead of the class instance.

To fix this issue, we need to change `worker_id` to `self` as the first argument in the `__init__` function so that the instance variables are correctly assigned to the class instance. Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
# The corrected version of the function
def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
    self.id = worker_id
    self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
    self.last_active = last_active  # seconds since epoch
    self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
    self.tasks = set()  # task objects
    self.info = {}
```

By making this change, the instance variables will be correctly initialized when creating an instance of the class.
