The bug in the provided function is with the parameter `last_active`. The function is designed to accept a parameter `last_active` with a default value of `None`, but the provided value is not being assigned to the variable `last_active`.

To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the `last_active` parameter is correctly assigned. One way to achieve this is by modifying the function to check if `last_active` is not provided and then assign it accordingly.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: luigi/scheduler.py

# corrected version of the function
def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
    self.id = worker_id
    self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
    self.last_active = last_active if last_active is not None else time.time()  # seconds since epoch
    self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
    self.tasks = set()  # task objects
    self.info = {}
```

With this correction, the function will now correctly assign the `last_active` parameter if a value is provided, and if not provided, it will default to the current time using `time.time()`. This modification ensures the bug is fixed and the function works as intended.
