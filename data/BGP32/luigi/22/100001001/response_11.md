The bug in the provided code lies in the incorrect initialization of the `self.last_active` attribute. 

### Cause of the Bug:
In the buggy function, the `last_active` parameter is set to `None` by default. So, when the `last_active` parameter is not provided during the function call, the value of `last_active` remains `None` which leads to a conversion issue when using it in the constructor.

### Fix:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the `last_active` parameter is properly initialized as `time.time()` if it is not provided during the function call.

### Corrected Version:
```python
# The corrected version of the function
def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
    self.id = worker_id
    self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
    self.last_active = last_active if last_active is not None else time.time()  # seconds since epoch
    self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
    self.tasks = set()  # task objects
    self.info = {}
``` 

By checking if `last_active` is `None`, we can initialize it to the current time using `time.time()` if it hasn't been provided, resolving the bug.
