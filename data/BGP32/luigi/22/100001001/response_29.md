### Analysis
The buggy function `__init__` is missing the `self` parameter in its definition, which is essential for instance methods in Python classes. Without the `self` parameter, the function will not be able to access or modify the attributes of the class instance.

### Bug Cause
The absence of the `self` parameter in the function definition prevents the correct initialization of the class attributes. As a result, even if the `worker_id` parameter is correctly passed to the function, the instance attributes such as `self.id`, `self.started`, `self.tasks`, and `self.info` are not properly assigned, leading to incorrect behavior.

### Fix
To fix the bug, add the `self` parameter to the function definition so that it can access and initialize the class attributes correctly.

### Corrected Version
```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: luigi/scheduler.py

class Scheduler:
    def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
        self.id = worker_id
        self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
        self.last_active = last_active  # seconds since epoch
        self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        self.tasks = set()  # task objects
        self.info = {}
```

By defining the `__init__` function within the `Scheduler` class and including the `self` parameter, the correct initialization of the class attributes is ensured, fixing the bug.
