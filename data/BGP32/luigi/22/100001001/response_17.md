The issue in the provided function is that it is missing the `self` parameter in the function definition, making it a standalone function rather than a method of a class.

### Fixing the bug
To fix the bug, we need to define the function within a class and add the `self` parameter to the `__init__` method. 

### Corrected version of the function
```python
# The corrected version of the function
class Scheduler:
    def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
        self.id = worker_id
        self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
        self.last_active = last_active  # seconds since epoch
        self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        self.tasks = set()  # task objects
        self.info = {}
```

By incorporating the `self` parameter in the `__init__` method within a class, we ensure that the function is now part of a class and can properly set the instance attributes.
