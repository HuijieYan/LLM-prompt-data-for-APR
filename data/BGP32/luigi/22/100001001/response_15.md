The bug in the provided code is that the `last_active` parameter is not properly initialized and may lead to unexpected behavior if not provided during object creation. The `last_active` parameter is intended to store the time since the worker was last active, but if not provided, it defaults to `None`.

To fix this bug, we should properly initialize the `last_active` parameter in the `__init__` function. We can use the current time as the default value for `last_active` if it is not explicitly provided during object creation.

Here is the corrected version of the `__init__` function:

```python
import time

def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
    self.id = worker_id
    self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
    self.last_active = last_active if last_active is not None else time.time()  # seconds since epoch
    self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
    self.tasks = set()  # task objects
    self.info = {}
```

With this modification, if the `last_active` parameter is not provided during object creation, it will default to the current time, ensuring that the worker's last active time is properly initialized.
