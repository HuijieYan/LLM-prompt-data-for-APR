The bug in the provided function is that it assigns the same value for `last_active` to all instances of the class, resulting in incorrect behavior. The variable `last_active` should be set to the provided `last_active` value if specified or to the current time if not.

To fix the bug, the initialization of `last_active` should be adjusted as follows:

```python
import time

# The corrected __init__ function
def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
    self.id = worker_id
    self.reference = None
    self.last_active = last_active if last_active is not None else time.time()  # adjusting the initialization of last active
    self.started = time.time()
    self.tasks = set()
    self.info = {}
```

This corrected version ensures that `last_active` is set to the provided value if it exists, or to the current time otherwise.
