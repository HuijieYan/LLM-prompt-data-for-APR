## Bug Explanation
The bug in the original function is that the `last_active` parameter is incorrectly assigned the value of `None` by default when it should be assigned the value of `time.time()` if no value is provided during initialization. This leads to incorrect behavior in the function as the `last_active` attribute doesn't reflect the actual time of initialization.

## Bug Fix
To fix the bug, we need to modify the initialization of the `last_active` attribute to assign the value of `time.time()` if no value is provided. Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
# The corrected function
def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
    self.id = worker_id
    self.reference = None
    self.last_active = last_active if last_active is not None else time.time()
    self.started = time.time()
    self.tasks = set()
    self.info = {}
```

This corrected version checks if the `last_active` parameter is `None`. If it is `None`, it assigns the current time using `time.time()`. Otherwise, it assigns the provided value. This ensures that the `last_active` attribute always reflects the correct time of initialization.
