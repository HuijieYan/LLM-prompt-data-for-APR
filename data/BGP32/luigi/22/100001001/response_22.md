The bug in the provided function is that it is not correctly initializing the `last_active` parameter. The function is supposed to assign the value of `last_active` passed as an argument, but it is assigning a default value of `None` to `last_active` for every worker.

### Strategy for fixing the bug:
To fix the bug, we need to modify the function to correctly initialize the `last_active` parameter based on the input value. If no value is provided, it should default to `None`.

### Corrected version of the function:
```python
def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
    self.id = worker_id
    self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
    self.last_active = last_active if last_active is not None else time.time()  # seconds since epoch or None
    self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
    self.tasks = set()  # task objects
    self.info = {}
``` 

By making this change, the function now correctly initializes the `last_active` parameter based on the input value and defaults to the current time if no value is provided.
