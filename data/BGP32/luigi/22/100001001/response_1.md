### Explanation
In the provided buggy function, the `__init__` method is missing the reference to the `self` parameter, leading to a syntax error when the class instance is created. This missing reference causes the function to fail to initialize properly.

### Bug Fix
To fix this bug, add the `self` parameter to the `__init__` method signature so that it can properly reference the instance of the class.

### Corrected Version
```python
# The corrected version of the buggy file: luigi/scheduler.py

# Corrected __init__ method with the self parameter reference
def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
    self.id = worker_id
    self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
    self.last_active = last_active  # seconds since epoch
    self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
    self.tasks = set()  # task objects
    self.info = {}
```
