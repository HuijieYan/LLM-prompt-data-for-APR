The bug in the provided function is related to the incorrect initialization of the `last_active` parameter. In the buggy code, the `last_active` parameter is set to `None` by default and is not properly handled during initialization.

However, based on the runtime input/output values provided, it is evident from the initialized values in the buggy function that the `last_active` parameter is actually expected to be in seconds since epoch (similar to `started`).

To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the `last_active` parameter is initialized correctly to seconds since epoch if it is not provided during the object creation.

Here is the corrected version of the function:
```python
def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
    self.id = worker_id
    self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
    self.last_active = last_active if last_active is not None else time.time()  # seconds since epoch
    self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
    self.tasks = set()  # task objects
    self.info = {}
```

With this correction, the `last_active` parameter will be initialized to the current time in seconds since epoch if no value is provided, ensuring consistency with the `started` parameter.
