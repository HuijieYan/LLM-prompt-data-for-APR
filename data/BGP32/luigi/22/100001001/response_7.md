The bug in the provided function is that the `last_active` parameter defaults to `None`, which may cause issues when comparing or using it as a timestamp value. To fix this issue, we should assign the current time to `last_active` if it is not provided.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
    self.id = worker_id
    self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
    if last_active is not None:
        self.last_active = last_active  # seconds since epoch
    else:
        self.last_active = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
    self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
    self.tasks = set()  # task objects
    self.info = {}
```

By explicitly checking if `last_active` is provided or not, and assigning the current time if it is not provided, we ensure that `last_active` will always have a valid timestamp value. This correction should address the potential issue of using `None` as a timestamp and prevent any bugs related to timestamp calculations or comparisons.
