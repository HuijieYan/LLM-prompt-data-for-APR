The bug in the provided function `__init__` is that it doesn't handle the `last_active` parameter properly. The `last_active` parameter is intended to represent the time since the worker was last active in seconds, but the code is currently assigning it directly without checking its validity.

### Cause of the Bug
In the buggy function, the `last_active` parameter is not processed or converted into seconds since epoch like `time.time()`. It is assumed to be passed in as seconds since epoch, but if it is not provided or is provided in a different format, the code will not handle it correctly, leading to potential bugs.

### Fixing the Bug
To fix the bug, we need to add a check to handle the `last_active` parameter properly, converting it into seconds since epoch if necessary. We can achieve this by checking if `last_active` is `None`, in which case we can set it to `time.time()` to represent the current time in seconds since epoch. If `last_active` is provided by the user, we should validate its format and convert it into seconds since epoch if needed.

### Corrected Version
```python
def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
    self.id = worker_id
    self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
    if last_active is None:
        self.last_active = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
    else:
        try:
            # Assuming last_active is in seconds since epoch
            self.last_active = last_active
        except ValueError:
            # Handle invalid format, default to current time
            self.last_active = time.time()
    
    self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
    self.tasks = set()  # task objects
    self.info = {}
```

This corrected version checks if `last_active` is `None` and handles it appropriately. It also includes a try-except block to catch any potential errors when converting `last_active` into seconds since epoch.
