The bug in the provided function is that the `__init__` method is not defined within a class. The correct way to define a class in Python is to use the `class` keyword. 

Here is the corrected version of the function with the `__init__` method properly defined within a class:

```python
import time

class Worker:
    def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
        self.id = worker_id
        self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
        self.last_active = last_active  # seconds since epoch
        self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        self.tasks = set()  # task objects
        self.info = {}

# Test the corrected function
worker = Worker(123)
print(worker.id)
print(worker.started)
print(worker.tasks)
print(worker.info)
```

The above corrected code defines a class named `Worker` with the `__init__` method correctly implemented within it. The `Worker` class now properly initializes the attributes `id`, `reference`, `last_active`, `started`, `tasks`, and `info` for each instance of the class.

By following this correction, the function will work as expected without any bugs related to the definition of the class.
