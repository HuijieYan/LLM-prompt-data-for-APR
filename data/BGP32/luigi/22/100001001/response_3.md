The bug in the provided function is that the `__init__` function is missing the `self` parameter, resulting in a `TypeError`. To fix this bug, we need to add the `self` parameter to the function signature.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: luigi/scheduler.py

class Scheduler:
    def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
        self.id = worker_id
        self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
        self.last_active = last_active  # seconds since epoch
        self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        self.tasks = set()  # task objects
        self.info = {}
```

By adding the `self` parameter to the `__init__` function, we correctly initialize the instance attributes of the `Scheduler` class. This will resolve the `TypeError` that occurred due to the missing `self` parameter.
