The issue in the provided `__init__` function is that the `last_active` parameter is being assigned as a class level attribute without validating its type. This can lead to potential issues if the `last_active` parameter provided is not a valid datetime value.

### Bug Explanation
In the case where the `worker_id` is passed as `123` and `last_active` is not provided (default is `None`), the `last_active` parameter is directly assigned to the class attribute `self.last_active` without any validation. This can cause issues if a non-integer value is passed to `last_active`.

### Fix Strategy
To fix this bug, we should validate the `last_active` parameter before assigning it as a class attribute. We can check if the `last_active` parameter is a valid integer or None before assigning it to `self.last_active`.

### Corrected Version
```python
def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
    self.id = worker_id
    self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
    
    if last_active is None or isinstance(last_active, (int, float)):
        self.last_active = last_active  # seconds since epoch
    else:
        raise ValueError("Invalid value for last_active. Please provide a valid integer value or None.")
    
    self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
    self.tasks = set()  # task objects
    self.info = {}
```

By adding the validation check for `last_active` before assigning it to `self.last_active`, we ensure that only valid integer values or None can be assigned to this attribute. This fix helps prevent potential issues related to incorrect input values for `last_active`.
