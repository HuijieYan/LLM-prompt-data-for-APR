The issue in the provided `__init__` function is that the `last_active` parameter is not properly assigned if a value is not provided. It defaults to `None`, which can cause issues when the function tries to handle the `last_active` variable as a timestamp.

To fix this bug, we should handle the case where `last_active` is not provided and set it to `time.time()` to have a proper timestamp by default.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
import time

def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
    self.id = worker_id
    self.reference = None
    self.last_active = last_active if last_active is not None else time.time()
    self.started = time.time()
    self.tasks = set()
    self.info = {}
```

By checking if `last_active` is `None` and setting it to `time.time()` in that case, we ensure that the variable always holds a valid timestamp.
