### Analysis
The `last_active` parameter is supposed to be an optional parameter that defaults to `None`, meaning it should be a timestamp in seconds since epoch indicating when the worker was last active. However, the buggy function is not correctly handling the `last_active` parameter, which results in the worker not being properly initialized with the provided `last_active` value.

### Bug Explanation
In the provided case, the `last_active` parameter is not being used to initialize `self.last_active`, causing it to remain `None`. This leads to a discrepancy between the expected behavior (setting `last_active` if provided) and the actual function implementation.

### Fix
To fix the bug, the function needs to correctly handle the `last_active` parameter. If a value is provided for `last_active`, it should be used to initialize `self.last_active`. Otherwise, it should default to `None`. The corrected version of the function is as follows:

```python
def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
    self.id = worker_id
    self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
    self.last_active = last_active if last_active is not None else None  # seconds since epoch
    self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
    self.tasks = set()  # task objects
    self.info = {}
```

This correction ensures that the `last_active` parameter is properly utilized to initialize `self.last_active` if a value is provided. If `last_active` is not provided, it defaults to `None` as intended.
