The bug in the provided function lies in the way the `__init__` method is defined, specifically in the parameter `last_active=None`. The issue is that the default value of `None` for `last_active` is being overridden by the initialization in the next line `self.last_active = last_active`.

This causes the `last_active` variable to always take the value of `None` even when a value is passed as an argument during the function call, leading to unexpected behavior in the function.

To fix this bug, the default value of `last_active` should be set to `None` in the function parameters and then updated only if a value is passed during the function call.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: luigi/scheduler.py

def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
    self.id = worker_id
    self.reference = None
    self.last_active = last_active if last_active is not None else time.time()
    self.started = time.time()
    self.tasks = set()
    self.info = {}
``` 

By making this adjustment, the `last_active` variable will correctly store the value passed during the function call if provided, otherwise default to the current time when the function is executed.
