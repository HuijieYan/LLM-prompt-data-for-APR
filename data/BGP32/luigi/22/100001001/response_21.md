The issue in the current implementation is that the `last_active` parameter is not being assigned correctly in the `__init__` method. In the buggy implementation, `last_active` is set as a default argument `None`, but it is not being assigned to the instance variable `self.last_active`. This causes the `self.last_active` to remain `None` even if a value is passed during object creation.

To fix this bug, we need to explicitly assign the `last_active` parameter to `self.last_active` in the `__init__` method.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
# The corrected version of the function
def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
    self.id = worker_id
    self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
    self.last_active = last_active if last_active is not None else time.time()  # seconds since epoch
    self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
    self.tasks = set()  # task objects
    self.info = {}
```

With this correction, the `last_active` parameter is assigned to `self.last_active` if a value is provided during object creation, otherwise, it defaults to the current time using `time.time()`. This ensures that `self.last_active` reflects the correct value based on the input parameter.
