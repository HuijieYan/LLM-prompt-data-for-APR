The bug in the provided function is that the `last_active` parameter is not properly assigned when creating an instance of the class. This leads to a potential issue where `last_active` may remain as `None` even when a specific value should be assigned.

To fix this bug, you can modify the `__init__` function to include a conditional check for the `last_active` parameter and assign a default value if it is `None`. Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
    self.id = worker_id
    self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
    self.last_active = last_active if last_active is not None else time.time()  # seconds since epoch or current time
    self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
    self.tasks = set()  # task objects
    self.info = {}
```

With this modification, if the `last_active` parameter is not provided when creating an instance of the class, the current time will be used as the default value for `last_active`. This ensures that there is always a valid value assigned to `last_active`.
