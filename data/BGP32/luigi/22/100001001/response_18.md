The bug in the provided function is that the `__init__` constructor is not properly defined within a class. It seems like the provided code is just the function itself and lacks the class definition.

To fix this bug, we need to define a class containing this `__init__` constructor. Here is the corrected version:

```python
import time

class Worker:
    def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
        self.id = worker_id
        self.reference = None
        self.last_active = last_active
        self.started = time.time()
        self.tasks = set()
        self.info = {}

# Example usage:
worker = Worker(123)
print(worker.id)
print(worker.started)
print(worker.tasks)
print(worker.info)
```

By defining the `__init__` constructor within a `Worker` class, we can now create instances of the `Worker` class with the correct attributes set during initialization.
