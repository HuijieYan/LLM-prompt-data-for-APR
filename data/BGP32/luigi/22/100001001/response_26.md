The bug in the provided function lies in the incorrect initialization of the `last_active` variable. It is currently set to `None`, which causes issues when comparing the value with `time.time()` later in the code.

To fix the bug, we need to check if `last_active` is provided. If not, we can set it to `time.time()` to capture the current time when the worker is created.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
    self.id = worker_id
    self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
    if last_active is None:
        self.last_active = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
    else:
        self.last_active = last_active
    self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
    self.tasks = set()  # task objects
    self.info = {}
```

With this fix, the `last_active` variable will correctly default to the current time if not provided during the worker initialization. This ensures that there is a valid timestamp available for comparisons in the rest of the code.
