The bug in the given buggy function is that the `last_active` parameter is not correctly assigned to the `self.last_active` attribute. The `last_active` parameter is provided as an optional argument with a default value of `None`, but it is not handled properly within the function.

To fix this bug, we can update the `__init__` function to correctly assign the `last_active` parameter to `self.last_active` if it is provided, or set it to `None` otherwise.

Here is the corrected version of the function:
```python
def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
    self.id = worker_id
    self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
    self.last_active = last_active if last_active is not None else None  # seconds since epoch
    self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
    self.tasks = set()  # task objects
    self.info = {}
```

With this correction, the `last_active` parameter will be correctly assigned to `self.last_active` based on the input value provided at runtime.
