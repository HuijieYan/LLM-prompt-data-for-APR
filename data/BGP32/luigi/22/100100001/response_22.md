### Analysis:
The `__init__` method of the `Worker` class in the `luigi.scheduler.py` file is missing the `self` parameter in its definition. This is causing an issue when the `Worker` object is instantiated.

### Potential Error Location:
The error is in the `__init__` method definition in the `Worker` class.

### Cause of the Bug:
The buggy function does not have the `self` parameter in its definition, which leads to an error when trying to access instance variables within the method.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
Add the `self` parameter to the `__init__` method definition to ensure correct instantiation of the `Worker` object and access to instance variables.

### Corrected Version:
```python
# The corrected version of the buggy function

def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
    self.id = worker_id
    self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
    self.last_active = last_active  # seconds since epoch
    self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
    self.tasks = set()  # task objects
    self.info = {}
```

After applying this correction, the `Worker` object will be properly initialized and the `test_worker_prune_after_init` test case should pass successfully.
