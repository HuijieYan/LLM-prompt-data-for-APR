The bug in the provided `__init__` function is that it is missing the class definition. The `__init__` function should be enclosed within a class definition for it to work properly.

Here's the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
class Worker:
    def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
        self.id = worker_id
        self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
        self.last_active = last_active  # seconds since epoch
        self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        self.tasks = set()  # task objects
        self.info = {}
```

By defining the `Worker` class and encapsulating the `__init__` function within it, the code should now work properly with the given test function. This corrected version of the buggy function should pass the failing test.
