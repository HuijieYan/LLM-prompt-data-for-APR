### Analysis:
The buggy function `__init__` in the `luigi.scheduler.Worker` class initializes several attributes of a worker object, such as `self.id`, `self.reference`, `self.last_active`, `self.started`, `self.tasks`, and `self.info`. The issue with the buggy function is that the `last_active` parameter is set to `None` by default, which could cause problems when trying to access or manipulate this attribute.

### Identify potential error locations:
The potential error location is the default `None` value assigned to the `last_active` attribute when creating a new `Worker` instance.

### Explanation of the bug:
The bug in the original code arises when the `prune` method is called on a `Worker` object. The `prune` method expects a parameter `config` to be passed, but since the `last_active` attribute is set to `None` by default, it could lead to unexpected behavior in the `prune` method when trying to use the `last_active` attribute.

### Strategy for fixing the bug:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the `last_active` attribute is properly initialized with a valid default value when creating a `Worker` instance. This will prevent potential issues when accessing or using this attribute during the `prune` method call.

### Corrected version of the function:
```python
def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
    self.id = worker_id
    self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
    self.last_active = last_active if last_active is not None else time.time()  # seconds since epoch
    self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
    self.tasks = set()  # task objects
    self.info = {}
```

By updating the initialization of the `last_active` attribute to `last_active if last_active is not None else time.time()`, we ensure that a valid default value is assigned when creating a new `Worker` instance. This change will address the bug and prevent any unexpected behavior when calling the `prune` method with a `config` parameter.
