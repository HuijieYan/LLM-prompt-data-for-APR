### Analysis:
1. The `__init__` function in the `luigi.scheduler.Worker` class initializes the worker object with the provided `worker_id`, `last_active`, `reference`, and other attributes.
2. The `prune` method in the `Worker` class is called in the failing test case after creating a worker object but it relies on the correct initialization of the `Worker` object.

### Potential Error Location:
The potential error lies in how the `Worker` object is initialized in the `__init__` function.

### Explanation of the Bug:
The bug occurs because the `prune` method is being called with a `TmpCfg` object but the `Worker` object is not initialized correctly in the `__init__` function to handle this scenario, leading to the bug.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
The `prune` method seems to rely on the `last_active` attribute being set and also uses a `TmpCfg` object while initializing the `Worker` object. We need to ensure that the `__init__` function properly handles the initialization of these attributes.

### Corrected Version of the `__init__` function:
```python
def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
    self.id = worker_id
    self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
    self.last_active = last_active if last_active is not None else time.time()  # seconds since epoch
    self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
    self.tasks = set()  # task objects
    self.info = {}
```

With this corrected version, the `last_active` attribute will default to the current time if not provided during initialization, ensuring that the `prune` method can work correctly with the `TmpCfg` object in the failing test case.
