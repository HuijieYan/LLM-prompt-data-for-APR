## Analysis:
1. The buggy function `__init__` in the `scheduler.py` file is missing the `self` parameter in its definition, causing it to fail when creating a Worker object.
2. The `__init__` function should always include `self` as the first parameter to correctly reference the instance being created.

## Bug Cause:
The bug is caused by the missing `self` parameter in the `__init__` function of the `Worker` class. Without `self`, the function does not have a reference to the instance being created and cannot initialize the instance attributes properly.

## Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
1. Add the `self` parameter to the `__init__` function to properly reference the instance.
2. Ensure that all instance attributes are initialized correctly within the function.

## Corrected Version:
```python
# The corrected version of the buggy function

# in luigi/scheduler.py
class Worker:
    def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
        self.id = worker_id
        self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
        self.last_active = last_active  # seconds since epoch
        self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        self.tasks = set()  # task objects
        self.info = {}

# The test should now pass with the corrected function
``` 

After applying the correction to the `Worker` class in the `scheduler.py` file, the `test_worker_prune_after_init` test should now pass without any errors.
