The bug in the provided function `__init__` is that the argument `last_active` is being set to the default value of `None`, which can lead to issues when comparing this value with other timestamps in the code later on.

The failing test `test_worker_prune_after_init` is trying to create an instance of `Worker` and then call the `prune` method on it with a temporary configuration. However, the `Worker` instance creation is failing due to the bug in the `__init__` function.

To fix the bug, we can set the `last_active` argument to the current time when the `Worker` instance is created. This way, we ensure that `last_active` is always initialized with a valid timestamp for comparison purposes.

Here is the corrected version of the `__init__` function:
```python
def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
    self.id = worker_id
    self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
    if last_active is not None:
        self.last_active = last_active
    else:
        self.last_active = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
    self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
    self.tasks = set()  # task objects
    self.info = {}
```

With this correction, the `last_active` value will be initialized with the current time if no specific value is provided during the creation of a `Worker` instance, ensuring that it is a valid timestamp for further comparisons in the code.
