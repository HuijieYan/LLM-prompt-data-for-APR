The bug in the `__init__` function lies in the fact that the `last_active` parameter is not being used in the initialization process. This could potentially cause issues when creating a `Worker` instance with a specified `last_active` value.

In the failing test `test_worker_prune_after_init`, a `Worker` instance is created with `worker_id=123` but no `last_active` value is provided. This causes the `last_active` attribute of the `Worker` instance to default to `None`, which might lead to unexpected behavior in the `prune` method.

To fix this bug, we should ensure that the `last_active` parameter is properly utilized in the `__init__` function to initialize the `last_active` attribute of the `Worker` instance correctly.

Here is the corrected version of the `__init__` function:
```python
def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
    self.id = worker_id
    self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
    self.last_active = last_active if last_active is not None else time.time()  # seconds since epoch
    self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
    self.tasks = set()  # task objects
    self.info = {}
```

Now, the `last_active` attribute will be initialized with the provided value if one is given, otherwise it will default to the current time using `time.time()`.

This correction ensures that the `last_active` parameter is correctly handled during the initialization of a `Worker` instance, addressing the bug and allowing the failing test `test_worker_prune_after_init` to pass.
