The bug in the provided code is in the `__init__` function of the `Worker` class in the scheduler module. The bug is that the `__init__` function incorrectly initializes the `last_active` attribute without verifying if it's None or not. This leads to the `prune` method being called with a non-integer value for `last_active`, causing potential issues.

To fix this bug, the `__init__` function should be modified to check if `last_active` is None. If it is None, initialize `last_active` to `time.time()` to set the current time in seconds since epoch. Otherwise, set `last_active` to the provided value.

Here is the corrected version of the `__init__` function:

```python
def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
    self.id = worker_id
    self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
    self.last_active = time.time() if last_active is None else last_active  # seconds since epoch
    self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
    self.tasks = set()  # task objects
    self.info = {}
```

With this correction, the `Worker` class will handle the initialization of the `last_active` attribute correctly, avoiding potential issues when calling the `prune` method.

After applying this fix, the failing test mentioned above should pass without any issues.
