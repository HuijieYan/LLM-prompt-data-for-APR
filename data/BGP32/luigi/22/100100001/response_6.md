The bug in the provided function is that the `prune` method is being called in the test function, but the `prune` method is not defined in the buggy function. 

To fix this bug, we need to add the `prune` method to the `Worker` class in the scheduler.py file. We can update the `Worker` class as follows:

```python
class Worker:
    def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
        self.id = worker_id
        self.reference = None
        self.last_active = last_active
        self.started = time.time()
        self.tasks = set()
        self.info = {}
        
    def prune(self, config):
        current_time = time.time()
        if self.last_active and current_time - self.last_active > config.worker_disconnect_delay:
            self.last_active = None
```

With this corrected version, the `prune` method will check if the worker has been inactive for longer than the specified `worker_disconnect_delay` in the `config` object passed to it. If the worker has been inactive for too long, it will reset the `last_active` attribute to `None`.

By adding the `prune` method to the `Worker` class, the test function should now be able to call it without any issues and the test should pass.
