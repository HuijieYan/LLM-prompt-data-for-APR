The issue with the provided `__init__` function is that it does not handle the case when `last_active` is not provided. This results in an AttributeError when trying to access a property of a NoneType object in the `Worker` class.

To fix this issue, we need to make sure that if `last_active` is not provided, it defaults to `None` to avoid the AttributeError.

Here is the corrected version of the `__init__` function:

```python
def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
    self.id = worker_id
    self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
    self.last_active = last_active if last_active is not None else None  # seconds since epoch
    self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
    self.tasks = set()  # task objects
    self.info = {}
```

By adding `if last_active is not None else None`, we ensure that if `last_active` is not provided, it defaults to `None`.

With this correction, the `Worker` class will now correctly handle the case when `last_active` is not provided, and the test case `test_worker_prune_after_init` should pass without any issues.
