The bug in the provided function `__init__` is that it is missing the `self` parameter in its signature. Therefore, when an instance of `Worker` class is created and the `prune` method is called in the test function, it tries to access `prune` method in the global namespace instead of the instance's namespace. This results in an AttributeError.

To fix this bug, we need to include the `self` parameter in the `__init__` method signature so that the instance attributes are properly initialized.

Here is the corrected version of the `__init__` function:
```python
# The corrected version of the buggy function
def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
    self.id = worker_id
    self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
    self.last_active = last_active  # seconds since epoch
    self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
    self.tasks = set()  # task objects
    self.info = {}
```

By adding `self` as the first parameter in the `__init__` function, the instance attributes will be properly initialized, and the test function should now pass without any errors.
