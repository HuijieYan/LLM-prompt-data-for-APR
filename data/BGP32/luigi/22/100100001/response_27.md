The bug in the provided `__init__` function is that it does not initialize the `last_active` attribute correctly. The `last_active` attribute is expected to default to None if not provided during worker initialization.

To fix this bug, we can modify the `__init__` function to properly handle the `last_active` parameter defaulting to None if not provided.

Here's the corrected version of the `__init__` function:

```python
# Corrected version of the __init__ function
def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
    self.id = worker_id
    self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
    self.last_active = last_active if last_active is not None else time.time()  # seconds since epoch
    self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
    self.tasks = set()  # task objects
    self.info = {}
```

With this correction, the default behavior is to set `last_active` to the current time in seconds since epoch if it is not provided during worker initialization.

By making this change, the corrected `__init__` function should now function properly and pass the failing test `test_worker_prune_after_init` in `scheduler_test.py`.
