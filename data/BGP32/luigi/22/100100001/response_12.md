The issue with the current implementation of the `__init__` method in the `Worker` class is that it doesn't initialize the `last_active` attribute correctly based on the provided argument. It only assigns a default value of `None` to `last_active` ignoring the value passed during initialization.

To fix this issue, we need to update the `__init__` method to properly initialize the `last_active` attribute based on the input argument `last_active`.

Here is the corrected version of the `__init__` method in the `Worker` class:

```python
# The corrected version of the __init__ method in the Worker class
def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
    self.id = worker_id
    self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
    self.last_active = last_active if last_active is not None else time.time()  # seconds since epoch
    self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
    self.tasks = set()  # task objects
    self.info = {}
```

By updating the `__init__` method as shown above, the `last_active` attribute will now be initialized correctly based on the input argument. This change ensures that the correct value is used for `last_active` when creating a new `Worker` object.

Once this corrected version is implemented, the failing test `test_worker_prune_after_init` should now pass without any issues.
