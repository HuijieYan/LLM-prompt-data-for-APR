## Analysis:
The buggy function `__init__` is missing the class definition and the `self` parameter. This will cause the function to fail when creating a new instance of the `Worker` class.

## Error Location:
The error is in the missing class definition and the missing `self` parameter in the `__init__` function of the `Worker` class.

## Bug Explanation:
Due to the missing class definition and `self` parameter, the `__init__` function is not properly initialized, leading to an AttributeError when trying to access attributes or methods of the `Worker` class.

## Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to add the class definition and the `self` parameter to the `__init__` function. This will ensure that the function is properly initialized and can set the necessary attributes for the `Worker` class.

## Corrected Version:
```python
# The corrected version of the buggy function
class Worker:
    def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
        self.id = worker_id
        self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
        self.last_active = last_active  # seconds since epoch
        self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        self.tasks = set()  # task objects
        self.info = {}

# The corrected version of the failing test
    def test_worker_prune_after_init(self):
        worker = luigi.scheduler.Worker(123)

        class TmpCfg:
            def __init__(self):
                self.worker_disconnect_delay = 10

        worker.prune(TmpCfg())
```

By adding the class definition and the `self` parameter in the `Worker` class, the corrected version should now pass the failing test successfully.
