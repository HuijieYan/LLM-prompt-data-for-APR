The bug in the `__init__` function of the `Worker` class seems to be that it initializes the `last_active` attribute with a default value of `None` rather than `time.time()`. This causes issues when trying to use `last_active` for calculations before it gets updated properly.

To fix this bug, the `last_active` attribute needs to be correctly initialized with the current time when a new worker instance is created.

Here is the corrected version of the `__init__` function:

```python
def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
    self.id = worker_id
    self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
    self.last_active = last_active if last_active is not None else time.time()  # seconds since epoch
    self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
    self.tasks = set()  # task objects
    self.info = {}
```

With this correction, the `last_active` attribute will be set to the current time if no initial value is provided. This ensures that the attribute is accurately initialized, avoiding issues later in the code.

Now, the `test_worker_prune_after_init` test should pass as the `last_active` attribute will be correctly set to the current time when creating a new `Worker` instance.
