The issue in the provided `__init__` function is that it does not handle the case where the `last_active` parameter is not provided during initialization. This can lead to errors when trying to assign `self.last_active`.

Explanation of the bug:
1. The `__init__` function of the `Worker` class expects a `worker_id` and an optional `last_active` parameter.
2. In the failing test case, the `Worker` object is instantiated without providing a `last_active` parameter.
3. Since the `last_active` parameter is not provided, the buggy `__init__` function tries to assign it directly, resulting in a `NoneType` error.

To fix this issue, we can modify the `__init__` function to handle the case where `last_active` is not provided. We can set a default value of `None` for `last_active` if it is not provided during initialization.

Here is the corrected version of the `__init__` function:

```python
def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
    self.id = worker_id
    self.reference = None  
    self.last_active = last_active if last_active is not None else int(time.time())  # Set current time if last_active is not provided
    self.started = time.time()  
    self.tasks = set()  
    self.info = {}
```

With this modification, the `last_active` parameter will default to the current time if not provided during initialization, resolving the issue identified in the failing test.

This corrected version should pass the failing test case provided.
