## Analysis:
The buggy function `__init__` in the `luigi/scheduler.py` file is missing the `self` parameter in its constructor, resulting in a `TypeError` when trying to initialize a Worker object with the provided test function.

## Error Location:
The `__init__` function in the `luigi/scheduler.py` file is missing the `self` parameter.

## Bug Explanation:
The bug occurs because the constructor function is defined without the `self` parameter, which is essential for instance methods in Python classes. Without the `self` parameter, the instance of the class is not passed as the first argument to the method call, resulting in an error when attempting to access properties of the object.

## Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to add the `self` parameter to the `__init__` method in the `Worker` class so that it can access and initialize the class properties correctly.

## The Corrected Version:
The corrected version of the `luigi/scheduler.py` file with the fixed `__init__` constructor function is as follows:

```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: luigi/scheduler.py

class Worker:
    def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
        self.id = worker_id
        self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
        self.last_active = last_active  # seconds since epoch
        self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        self.tasks = set()  # task objects
        self.info = {}
```

By adding the `self` parameter to the `__init__` function, the corrected version allows the `Worker` class to be initialized correctly with the provided test case.
