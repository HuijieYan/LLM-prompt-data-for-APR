The bug in the provided code is that the `prune()` method is being called on the `worker` instance in the test function, but the `prune()` method is not defined in the `Worker` class. This results in an AttributeError when trying to call `prune()`.

To fix this bug, we need to define the `prune()` method in the `Worker` class. Below is the corrected version of the `Worker` class with the `prune()` method added:

```python
# The corrected version of the buggy function
import time

class Worker:
    def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
        self.id = worker_id
        self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
        self.last_active = last_active  # seconds since epoch
        self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        self.tasks = set()  # task objects
        self.info = {}

    def prune(self, config):
        current_time = time.time()
        if self.last_active is not None and current_time - self.last_active > config.worker_disconnect_delay:
            # Perform the pruning operation
            self.tasks.clear()
```

With the `prune()` method added to the `Worker` class, the test function should now pass without any errors.
