The buggy function `__init__` is missing the `self` parameter, which is essential in Python class methods. This leads to an error when initializing the `Worker` object.

To fix this bug, we need to add the `self` parameter to the `__init__` method of the `Worker` class. Here is the corrected version of the `__init__` method:

```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: luigi/scheduler.py

# corrected version of the buggy function
def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
    self.id = worker_id
    self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
    self.last_active = last_active  # seconds since epoch
    self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
    self.tasks = set()  # task objects
    self.info = {}
```

By adding the `self` parameter to the `__init__` method, the `Worker` class will be properly initialized, and the failing test should pass without any errors.
