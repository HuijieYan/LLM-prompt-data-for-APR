### Analysis:
1. The `__init__` function defines the initialization of the `Worker` class, which takes `worker_id` and optional `last_active` parameters.
2. The primary purpose of this initialization function is to set up the attributes of the `Worker` object such as `id`, `reference`, `last_active`, `started`, `tasks`, and `info`.
3. The failing test `test_worker_prune_after_init` creates a `Worker` object and calls the `prune` method on it. This test expects the `prune` method to work correctly after initializing the `Worker` object.
4. The bug seems to be related to the initialization in the `__init__` function, as it sets the `last_active` attribute to a default value, but does not handle the case when `last_active` is passed as an argument.

### Bug:
The bug in the `__init__` function is that it initializes the `last_active` attribute using the default `None` value when the `last_active` parameter is not provided during object creation. This leads to potential issues when accessing the `last_active` attribute later in the code.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that if `last_active` is provided during object creation, it should be used to set the `last_active` attribute, otherwise handle the default scenario appropriately.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
# The corrected version of the __init__ function

def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
    self.id = worker_id
    self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
    self.last_active = last_active if last_active is not None else time.time()  # seconds since epoch
    self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
    self.tasks = set()  # task objects
    self.info = {}
```

By checking if `last_active` is provided during object creation, we ensure that the `last_active` attribute is appropriately set based on the input. This correction should address the bug and ensure that the `Worker` object initializes correctly for the given test case.
