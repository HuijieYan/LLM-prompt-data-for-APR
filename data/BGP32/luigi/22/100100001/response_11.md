The buggy function `__init__` in the `luigi/scheduler.py` file has an issue with the initialization of the `last_active` attribute. It's supposed to take an optional argument `last_active` which defaults to `None`, but the value provided in the test function is not being assigned to it during initialization.

The cause of the bug is that the `last_active` attribute is not being set properly in the `__init__` function, resulting in it always being `None` regardless of the value passed in. This can lead to incorrect behavior when using the `Worker` class.

To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the `last_active` attribute is assigned the value provided during initialization if it is not explicitly set to `None`.

Here is the corrected version of the `__init__` function:

```python
def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
    self.id = worker_id
    self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
    if last_active is not None:
        self.last_active = last_active  # seconds since epoch
    else:
        self.last_active = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
    self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
    self.tasks = set()  # task objects
    self.info = {}
```

With this correction, the `__init__` function will correctly set the `last_active` attribute to the provided value if it is not `None`, otherwise it will default to the current time using `time.time()`.

This corrected version should pass the failing test `test_worker_prune_after_init` in the `scheduler_test.py` file.
