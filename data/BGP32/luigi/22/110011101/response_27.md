The bug in the provided function is due to the `last_active` parameter being set to `None` by default, which causes a `TypeError` when it is involved in the comparison operation with an integer in the `prune()` method.

To fix this bug, we need to ensure that if `last_active` is not provided during initialization, it should default to a valid float value instead of `None`. 

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
class Worker(object):
    """
    Structure for tracking worker activity and keeping their references.
    """

    def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
        self.id = worker_id
        self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
        self.last_active = last_active if last_active is not None else time.time()  # seconds since epoch if last_active is not given
        self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        self.tasks = set()  # task objects
        self.info = {}
    
    def prune(self, config):
        # Delete workers that haven't said anything for a while (probably killed)
        if self.last_active + config.worker_disconnect_delay < time.time():
            pass  # Add the necessary logic here
```

By setting `last_active` to `time.time()` if it is not provided during initialization, we ensure that it always has a valid float value to compare with in the `prune()` method. This correction should resolve the `TypeError` issue encountered in the failing test.
