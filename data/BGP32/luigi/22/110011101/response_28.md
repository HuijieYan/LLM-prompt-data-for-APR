The bug in the `Worker` class's `__init__` method is causing the error due to the `last_active` parameter being set to `None` by default. When trying to access `self.last_active` in the `prune` method, Python is raising a `TypeError` because you cannot add an `int` to `None`.

To fix this issue, we should handle the case where `last_active` is `None` in the `__init__` method. We can set `last_active` to the current time if it is `None`. 

Here's the corrected version of the `__init__` method for the `Worker` class:

```python
class Worker(object):
    """
    Structure for tracking worker activity and keeping their references.
    """

    def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
        self.id = worker_id
        self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
        self.last_active = last_active if last_active is not None else time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        self.tasks = set()  # task objects
        self.info = {}
```

With this fix, the `__init__` method will initialize `last_active` to the current time if it is not provided, ensuring that it is always a valid timestamp.

This correction should make the failing test `test_worker_prune_after_init` pass successfully.
