The bug in the provided code arises from the `last_active` parameter being set to `None` by default in the `__init__` function of the `Worker` class. When the `prune` method is called with a configuration that expects `last_active` to be added to an integer value, the program tries to add an integer to `None`, resulting in a `TypeError`.

To fix this issue, you should initialize the `last_active` parameter in the `__init__` method to the provided default value `last_active=None`. Then, inside the `prune` method, you should check for the `None` value before adding it to the configuration value.

Here is the corrected version of the code:

```python
import time

class Worker(object):
    """
    Structure for tracking worker activity and keeping their references.
    """

    def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
        self.id = worker_id
        self.reference = None
        self.last_active = last_active if last_active is not None else time.time()
        self.started = time.time()
        self.tasks = set()
        self.info = {}

    def prune(self, config):
        if self.last_active is not None and self.last_active + config.worker_disconnect_delay < time.time():
            # Add logic to prune workers here
            pass
```

With this correction, the `prune` method now checks if `self.last_active` is not `None` before performing any operations with it, avoiding the `TypeError` that was previously occurring.
