To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the `last_active` parameter in the `__init__` method is properly initialized if it is not provided during object creation. Currently, the default value of `None` for `last_active` is causing a `TypeError` when trying to add it to an integer in the `prune` method.

We can fix this by setting the `last_active` to the current time if it is not provided. Here is the corrected version of the `__init__` method:

```python
class Worker(object):
    """
    Structure for tracking worker activity and keeping their references.
    """

    def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
        self.id = worker_id
        self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
        self.last_active = last_active if last_active is not None else time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        self.tasks = set()  # task objects
        self.info = {}
```

With this modification, the `last_active` parameter will default to the current time if not provided, ensuring that it is always an integer value. This will fix the `TypeError` that was occurring in the `prune` method.
