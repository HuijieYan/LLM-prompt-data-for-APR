The bug in the provided code stems from the fact that the `last_active` parameter in the `__init__` method of the `Worker` class can be passed as `None`, which then causes a `TypeError` when trying to add it to a number in the `prune` method.

To fix this issue, we can provide a default value for `last_active` in the `__init__` method, ensuring it is never `None` when used in calculations.

Here is the corrected version of the code:

```python
import time

# The relative path of the buggy file: luigi/scheduler.py

# The declaration of the class containing the buggy function
class Worker(object):
    """
    Structure for tracking worker activity and keeping their references.
    """

    def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=time.time()):
        self.id = worker_id
        self.reference = None  
        self.last_active = last_active   
        self.started = time.time()  
        self.tasks = set()  
        self.info = {}
    
    def prune(self, config):
        if self.last_active + config.worker_disconnect_delay < time.time():
            pass  # Implementation of prune method goes here

# The code above provides a default value for 'last_active' to avoid 'None' values causing TypeError in calculations.
```

With this correction, the `last_active` parameter will default to the current time when not provided during object instantiation, ensuring that it is a valid value for subsequent calculations in the `prune` method. This updated code should now pass the failing test scenario provided.
