The bug in the provided function is due to the `last_active` parameter having a default value of `None`, which causes a `TypeError` when trying to add an integer value to `None` in the `prune` method.

To fix this bug, we need to initialize `last_active` with the current time if no value is provided. This will ensure that `last_active` is always a valid timestamp.

Here is the corrected version of the `__init__` method:

```python
import time

class Worker(object):
    """
    Structure for tracking worker activity and keeping their references.
    """

    def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
        self.id = worker_id
        self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
        self.last_active = last_active if last_active is not None else time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        self.tasks = set()  # task objects
        self.info = {}
```

With this modification, the `last_active` parameter will default to the current time if no value is provided, ensuring that the arithmetic operation in the `prune` method does not encounter a `NoneType` error. This corrected version should now pass the failing test case and satisfy the expected input/output values.
