The bug in the provided code is due to the `last_active` parameter being set to `None` by default in the `__init__` function of the `Worker` class. When the `prune` method is called with this `last_active` parameter being `None`, trying to add an integer value to `None` in the `if` condition causes a `TypeError`.

To fix this bug, we need to check if `last_active` is `None` before performing the addition operation in the `prune` method. If it is `None`, we can assume a default value (such as 0) for calculation. 

Here is the corrected version of the `Worker` class with the fixed `prune` method:

```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: luigi/scheduler.py

# The declaration of the class containing the buggy function
class Worker(object):
    """
    Structure for tracking worker activity and keeping their references.
    """

    def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
        self.id = worker_id
        self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
        self.last_active = last_active if last_active is not None else 0  # seconds since epoch
        self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        self.tasks = set()  # task objects
        self.info = {}

    def prune(self, config):
        # Delete workers that haven't said anything for a while (probably killed)
        if self.last_active + config.worker_disconnect_delay < time.time():
            # Perform pruning operation here
            pass
```

With this correction, the `prune` method will handle `last_active` being `None` by defaulting it to 0 before performing any calculations, preventing the `TypeError` that occurred in the failing test case.
