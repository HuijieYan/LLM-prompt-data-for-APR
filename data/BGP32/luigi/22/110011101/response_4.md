The bug occurs due to the `last_active` variable being set to `None` by default in the `__init__` method, which causes a `TypeError` when trying to add an integer to `None`. To fix this issue, we can modify the `__init__` method to handle the case where `last_active` is `None` by setting it to the current time when creating a new `Worker` instance.

Here is the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
class Worker(object):
    """
    Structure for tracking worker activity and keeping their references.
    """

    def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
        self.id = worker_id
        self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
        self.last_active = last_active if last_active is not None else time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        self.tasks = set()  # task objects
        self.info = {}
```

Now, with this correction, the `last_active` variable will default to the current time if not provided during the `Worker` object creation. This change ensures that the variable is always initialized to a valid value, preventing the `TypeError` from occurring during operations involving `last_active`.
