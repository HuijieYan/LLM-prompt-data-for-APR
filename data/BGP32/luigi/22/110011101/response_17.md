The bug in the `Worker` class `__init__` function is caused by the `last_active` parameter being passed as `None` and then an operation trying to add an integer to it. This results in a `TypeError` since Python does not support adding `None` to an integer.

To fix this bug, we need to handle the case where `last_active` is `None` and assign a default value that can be safely added to an integer.

Here is the corrected version of the `__init__` function:

```python
class Worker(object):
    """
    Structure for tracking worker activity and keeping their references.
    """
    
    def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
        self.id = worker_id
        self.reference = None
        self.last_active = last_active if last_active is not None else time.time()
        self.started = time.time()
        self.tasks = set()
        self.info = {}
```

This fix ensures that if `last_active` is `None`, then the current time is used as a default value instead, which can be safely added to an integer. This corrected version should pass the failing test and satisfy the expected input/output values.
