The issue in the buggy function is that when the `last_active` parameter is not provided during initialization, it defaults to `None`. The `prune` method then tries to perform an operation of adding an integer to `None`, resulting in a `TypeError`.

To fix this issue, we need to check if `last_active` is `None` in the `prune` method before performing the addition operation. If it is `None`, we can set `last_active` to `0` instead.

Here is the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
class Worker(object):
    """
    Structure for tracking worker activity and keeping their references.
    """

    def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
        self.id = worker_id
        self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
        self.last_active = last_active if last_active is not None else 0  # seconds since epoch
        self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        self.tasks = set()  # task objects
        self.info = {}

    def prune(self, config):
        if self.last_active is None:
            self.last_active = 0
        
        if self.last_active + config.worker_disconnect_delay < time.time():
            # Prune the worker
            pass
```

With this fix, the `prune` method will first check if `last_active` is `None`, and if so, it will set it to `0` before performing the time comparison operation. This will prevent the `TypeError` that was occurring due to the addition of `None` and an integer.

The corrected version should now pass the failing test case and produce the expected output values.
