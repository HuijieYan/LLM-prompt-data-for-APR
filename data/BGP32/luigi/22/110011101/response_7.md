The bug in the provided function is due to the initialization of `last_active` as `None`, which causes a `TypeError` when trying to perform addition with an integer in the `prune` method.

To fix this bug, we need to ensure that if `last_active` is not provided, it defaults to the current time when initializing the `Worker` object.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
class Worker(object):
    """
    Structure for tracking worker activity and keeping their references.
    """

    def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
        self.id = worker_id
        self.reference = None
        self.last_active = last_active if last_active is not None else time.time()
        self.started = time.time()
        self.tasks = set()
        self.info = {}
```

This corrected version ensures that if `last_active` is not provided during initialization, it defaults to the current time, preventing any `TypeError` from occurring when performing operations with timestamps later on.
