The bug in the provided function lies in the initialization of the `last_active` parameter. When the `last_active` parameter is not provided during the creation of a Worker object, it defaults to `None`. This leads to the error when trying to add `None` to an integer value in the `prune` function.

To fix this issue, we need to update the `__init__` function to handle the case where `last_active` is not provided and set it to the current time.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
class Worker(object):
    """
    Structure for tracking worker activity and keeping their references.
    """

    def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
        self.id = worker_id
        self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
        if last_active is None:
            self.last_active = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        else:
            self.last_active = last_active
        self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        self.tasks = set()  # task objects
        self.info = {}

    def prune(self, config):
        # Delete workers that haven't said anything for a while (probably killed)
        if self.last_active + config.worker_disconnect_delay < time.time():
            # Perform pruning logic here
            pass
```

With this corrected version, the Worker object will initialize `last_active` to the current time if not provided, avoiding the TypeError encountered in the failing test.
