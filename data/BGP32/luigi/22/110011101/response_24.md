The bug in the `Worker` class `__init__` method is due to the `last_active` parameter being set to `None` which causes a TypeError when trying to use it in an addition operation. To fix this bug, we can set a default value for `last_active` using the `time.time()` function if it's not provided during initialization.

Here is the corrected version of the `__init__` method in the `Worker` class:

```python
class Worker:
    def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
        self.id = worker_id
        self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
        
        if last_active is None:
            self.last_active = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        else:
            self.last_active = last_active
        
        self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        self.tasks = set()  # task objects
        self.info = {}
```

With this correction, the `last_active` parameter will default to the current time if not provided, ensuring that it is always a valid timestamp for comparison in the `prune` method, thereby resolving the TypeError in the failing test.

The corrected version ensures that the behavior is aligned with the expected input/output values provided.
