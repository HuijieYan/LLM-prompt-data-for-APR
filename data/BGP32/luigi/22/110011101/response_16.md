To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the `last_active` attribute in the `Worker` class is initialized correctly in the `__init__` method. The error is occurring because the default value for `last_active` is `None`, and later in the code, there is an attempt to perform addition with `None` and an integer value, resulting in a `TypeError`.

We can fix this by setting a default value for `last_active` as the current time in seconds since epoch if it is not provided during initialization.

Here is the corrected version of the `__init__` method in the `Worker` class:

```python
class Worker(object):
    """
    Structure for tracking worker activity and keeping their references.
    """

    def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
        self.id = worker_id
        self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
        
        if last_active is None:
            self.last_active = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        else:
            self.last_active = last_active
        
        self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        self.tasks = set()  # task objects
        self.info = {}
```

With this correction, the `last_active` attribute will be initialized to the current time if no value is provided during the instantiation of a `Worker` object.

This update will ensure that the addition operation in the `prune` method will work correctly, and the test case `test_worker_prune_after_init` should now pass with the expected values mentioned.
