The bug in the provided `__init__` method of the `Worker` class is due to the `last_active` parameter being set to `None` by default and then used in a comparison operation without checking for its type. This leads to a `TypeError` when trying to add `NoneType` with an integer in the `prune` method.

To fix this bug, we can modify the comparison in the `prune` method to handle the case where `last_active` is `None`. We can check if `last_active` is `None` and set the comparison value accordingly.

Here is the corrected version of the `Worker` class:

```python
import time

class Worker(object):
    """
    Structure for tracking worker activity and keeping their references.
    """

    def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
        self.id = worker_id
        self.reference = None
        self.last_active = last_active
        self.started = time.time()
        self.tasks = set()
        self.info = {}
    
    def prune(self, config):
        if self.last_active is not None and self.last_active + config.worker_disconnect_delay < time.time():
            # Delete workers that haven't said anything for a while
            pass  # Add your deletion logic here
```

By checking if `last_active` is not `None` before performing the comparison in the `prune` method, we ensure that the function works correctly even when the initial value of `last_active` is not provided.

This corrected version should successfully pass the failing test scenario provided.
