The bug in the provided `Worker` class is due to the `last_active` parameter being set to `None` by default in the `__init__` method. This causes a `TypeError` when trying to add `None` to an integer in the `prune` method.

To fix this bug, we need to check if `last_active` is `None` in the `__init__` method and set it to the current time if it is. This will ensure that `last_active` always has a valid timestamp when the `Worker` object is initialized.

Here is the corrected version of the `Worker` class:

```python
class Worker(object):
    """
    Structure for tracking worker activity and keeping their references.
    """

    def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
        self.id = worker_id
        self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
        if last_active is None:
            self.last_active = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        else:
            self.last_active = last_active
        self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        self.tasks = set()  # task objects
        self.info = {}

    def prune(self, config):
        # Delete workers that haven't said anything for a while (probably killed)
        if self.last_active + config.worker_disconnect_delay < time.time():
            # Perform pruning operations here based on the condition
            pass
```

With this correction, the `last_active` timestamp will be initialized to the current time if no value is provided, ensuring that the `prune` method can be executed without encountering a `TypeError`.
