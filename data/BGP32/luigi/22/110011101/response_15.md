The bug occurs because the `last_active` parameter in the `__init__` function of the `Worker` class has a default value of `None`, which is causing a `TypeError` when trying to add it to an integer (`time.time()`).

To fix this bug, we can modify the initialization of `last_active` in the `__init__` function to use a conditional statement checking if it is `None`. If it is `None`, we can set it to the current time (`time.time()`).

Here is the corrected version of the `__init__` function in the `Worker` class:

```python
class Worker(object):
    """
    Structure for tracking worker activity and keeping their references.
    """

    def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
        self.id = worker_id
        self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
        
        if last_active is None:
            self.last_active = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        else:
            self.last_active = last_active
        
        self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        self.tasks = set()  # task objects
        self.info = {}
```

This modification ensures that if `last_active` is not provided, it will default to the current time, preventing the `TypeError` when trying to add `None` to an integer in cases where `last_active` is not specified.

This should resolve the issue and make the function work as expected with the provided test case.
