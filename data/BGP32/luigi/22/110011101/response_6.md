### Bug Explanation
The bug in the provided code arises from the fact that the `last_active` parameter in the `__init__` function of the `Worker` class is set to a default value of `None`, but later on, when trying to compare `self.last_active + config.worker_disconnect_delay` with `time.time()`, `self.last_active` being `None` causes a `TypeError` due to unsupported operand types. 

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix this bug, we need to ensure that if `last_active` is not provided as an argument during the initialization of a `Worker` object, it defaults to the current time when the object is created. This way, `self.last_active` will always be a valid timestamp, allowing for proper comparison in the `prune` function.

### Corrected Code
```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: luigi/scheduler.py

class Worker(object):
    """
    Structure for tracking worker activity and keeping their references.
    """

    def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
        self.id = worker_id
        self.reference = None  
        self.last_active = last_active if last_active is not None else time.time()  
        self.started = time.time()  
        self.tasks = set()  
        self.info = {}
```

After making this change, the `last_active` parameter will default to the current time when not provided, ensuring that `self.last_active` will always have a valid timestamp, preventing the `TypeError` during comparison in the `prune` function.
