The bug in the provided code is due to the initialization of `last_active` with `None` in the `__init__` method of the `Worker` class, which causes a `TypeError` when trying to add `config.worker_disconnect_delay` to it. 

To fix this bug, we can set `last_active` to the current time when it is not provided during object creation. This way, we ensure that `last_active` is always a valid timestamp for comparison.

Here is the corrected version of the `__init__` method in the `Worker` class:

```python
class Worker(object):
    """
    Structure for tracking worker activity and keeping their references.
    """

    def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
        self.id = worker_id
        self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
        if last_active is not None:
            self.last_active = last_active
        else:
            self.last_active = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        self.tasks = set()  # task objects
        self.info = {}
```

With this correction, the `last_active` attribute will be initialized with the current time if not provided, avoiding the `TypeError` encountered during the test execution. This change ensures that the function behaves correctly and meets the expected input and output values.
