## Bug Fix

The bug in the code arises from the `last_active` variable being set to `None` initially, which causes a `TypeError` when trying to perform addition with an integer value in the `prune()` method.

To fix this bug, we need to ensure that `last_active` is set to a default value that is compatible for addition with an integer. In this case, setting `last_active` to 0 (epoch time) if it is not provided during initialization should resolve the issue.

Here is the corrected version of the `__init__` function:

```python
class Worker(object):
    """
    Structure for tracking worker activity and keeping their references.
    """

    def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
        self.id = worker_id
        self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
        self.last_active = last_active if last_active is not None else 0  # seconds since epoch (default to 0 if not provided)
        self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        self.tasks = set()  # task objects
        self.info = {}
```

With this modification, the code should now handle the default case for `last_active` correctly, and the `prune()` method should work as expected without raising a `TypeError`.
