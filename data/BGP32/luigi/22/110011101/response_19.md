The bug in the provided code is due to the `last_active` parameter being set as `None` by default and then trying to perform an operation (addition) with an integer (time.time()). This results in a `TypeError` since `None` does not support addition with integers.

To fix this bug, you can modify the `__init__` function of the `Worker` class to handle the case where `last_active` is `None`. You can set a default value of `None` for `last_active` and then check if it is `None` before performing the addition with `time.time()`. If it is `None`, you can assign `time.time()` to `last_active`. Otherwise, keep the provided `last_active` value.

Here is the corrected version of the `__init__` function:

```python
class Worker(object):
    """
    Structure for tracking worker activity and keeping their references.
    """

    def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
        self.id = worker_id
        self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
        
        if last_active is None:
            self.last_active = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        else:
            self.last_active = last_active
        
        self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        self.tasks = set()  # task objects
        self.info = {}
```

With this correction, the function should now handle the case where `last_active` is `None` and set it to the current time using `time.time()`. This change ensures that the operation `self.last_active + config.worker_disconnect_delay` in the `prune` function won't raise a `TypeError`.

After making this modification, the function should pass the failing test case and satisfy the expected input/output values provided.
