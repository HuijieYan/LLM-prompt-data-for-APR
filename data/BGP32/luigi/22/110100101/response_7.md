### Explanation
The bug in the `__init__` function is that it expects a parameter `last_active` to be a float representing seconds since epoch, but the test code does not provide this parameter, leading to a `None` value being passed. This causes an issue when the worker object is created and the `last_active` value is set to `None`, leading to a type error when trying to compare it as a float.

### Strategy for fixing the bug
To fix this bug, we can check if the `last_active` parameter is provided and if not, set it to `None`. This will ensure that the `last_active` attribute is always a float, either with the provided value or with `None`.

### Corrected version of the buggy function

```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: luigi/scheduler.py

# The declaration of the class containing the buggy function
class Worker(object):
    """
    Structure for tracking worker activity and keeping their references.
    """

    def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
        self.id = worker_id
        self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
        if last_active is not None:
            self.last_active = last_active
        else:
            self.last_active = None
        self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        self.tasks = set()  # task objects
        self.info = {}
```

After applying this correction, the `Worker` class should now handle the case where `last_active` is not provided, ensuring that the initialization is done correctly and the test case is passed without any errors.
