## Analysis
The buggy function `__init__` in the `Worker` class is supposed to initialize a Worker object with the provided `worker_id`, `last_active` as the time when the worker was last active, and set other attributes. However, the `last_active` parameter may not be None by default, causing potential issues when calculating the difference between `last_active` and the current time.

The `test_worker_prune_after_init` test function creates a Worker object with `worker_id = 123` without providing a `last_active` value. It then calls the `prune` method on the Worker object with a temporary configuration object.

## Bug
The bug in the code is that the `last_active` parameter is not handled properly in the `__init__` method. By default, it is set to None, which can lead to issues later on when trying to calculate the timestamp difference. This can result in unexpected behavior and incorrect calculations, especially when the `last_active` is None.

## Fix
To fix the bug, we should handle the case where `last_active` is not provided during initialization. We can set `last_active` to the current time if it is None. This ensures that a meaningful default value is used for `last_active`.

Here is the corrected version of the code:

```python
class Worker(object):
    """
    Structure for tracking worker activity and keeping their references.
    """

    def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
        self.id = worker_id
        self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
        self.last_active = last_active if last_active is not None else time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        self.tasks = set()  # task objects
        self.info = {}
```

With this fix, the `last_active` parameter in the `__init__` method checks if it is None and sets it to the current time if it is. This ensures that a valid timestamp is always used for `last_active`.
