## Bug Analysis
The issue in the `__init__` function of the `Worker` class is that the `last_active` parameter is not correctly assigned to `self.last_active`. Instead, it is currently assigned to `self.started` in the buggy code. This causes `self.last_active` to remain `None` if the parameter `last_active` is not provided.

## Bug Fix Strategy
To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the `last_active` parameter is correctly assigned to `self.last_active` in the `__init__` function of the `Worker` class.

## The corrected version of the buggy function

```python
class Worker(object):
    """
    Structure for tracking worker activity and keeping their references.
    """

    def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
        self.id = worker_id
        self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
        self.last_active = last_active if last_active is not None else time.time()  # seconds since epoch if None provided
        self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        self.tasks = set()  # task objects
        self.info = {}
```

After fixing the `__init__` function as shown above, the `last_active` parameter will be correctly assigned to `self.last_active` ensuring that the buggy code assigns the input parameter correctly. The corrected version addresses the bug by considering the case where `last_active` might be `None` and adjusting the assignment accordingly.
