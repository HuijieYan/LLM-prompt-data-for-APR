The bug in the existing `__init__` function for the `Worker` class is that the `last_active` parameter is not correctly set when provided as an argument. The `last_active` parameter is intended to be the seconds since epoch representing when the worker was last active. However, in the current implementation, if `last_active` is provided as an argument, it will not be correctly assigned to `self.last_active`.

To fix the bug, we need to check if the `last_active` parameter is provided during the initialization and assign it to the `self.last_active` attribute accordingly.

Here is the corrected version of the `__init__` function for the `Worker` class:

```python
# The corrected version of the buggy function
class Worker:
    """
    Structure for tracking worker activity and keeping their references.
    """

    def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
        self.id = worker_id
        self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
        self.last_active = last_active if last_active is not None else time.time()  # seconds since epoch or current time
        self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        self.tasks = set()  # task objects
        self.info = {}
```

With this corrected version, the `last_active` parameter will be correctly assigned either with the provided value (if provided) or the current time in epoch seconds. This will ensure that the expected behavior is maintained and the test case `test_worker_prune_after_init` will pass successfully.
