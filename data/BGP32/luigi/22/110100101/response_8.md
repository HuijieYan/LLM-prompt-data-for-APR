### Analysis
The bug in the `__init__` function of the `Worker` class is that the `last_active` parameter is not being properly initialized. It defaults to `None` if not provided, which causes an issue when trying to access it as a timestamp later on.

### Bug
The bug occurs because the `last_active` parameter is not correctly set to the provided value or initialized properly.

### Fix
To fix the bug, we need to properly initialize the `last_active` parameter in the `__init__` function using the provided value or a default value. We can set it to the current timestamp if no value is provided.

### Corrected code
```python
# The corrected version of the buggy function
class Worker(object):
    """
    Structure for tracking worker activity and keeping their references.
    """

    def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
        self.id = worker_id
        self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
        self.last_active = last_active if last_active is not None else time.time()  # seconds since epoch or current time
        self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        self.tasks = set()  # task objects
        self.info = {}
```

Now, the corrected `__init__` function properly initializes the `last_active` parameter either with the provided value or with the current timestamp if no value is provided. This fix should resolve the issue encountered in the failing test.
