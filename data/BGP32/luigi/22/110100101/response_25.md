## Analysis
The buggy function `__init__` in the `Worker` class is supposed to initialize the attributes of a worker object, including `id`, `reference`, `last_active`, `started`, `tasks`, and `info`. The issue in the current implementation is that the `last_active` parameter is not being assigned correctly, leading to incorrect behavior when the `prune` method is called later on.

## Bug
The bug lies in the initialization of the `last_active` attribute in the `__init__` function. The `last_active` should be assigned the value of the input parameter `last_active` if it's provided, otherwise, it should default to `None`. However, currently, it always defaults to `None` even if a value is provided.

## Fix
To fix the bug, we need to update the initialization of the `last_active` attribute to consider the value of the input parameter `last_active`. If the parameter is not provided, we will default `last_active` to `None`.

## The corrected version of the function
```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: luigi/scheduler.py

# The declaration of the class containing the buggy function
class Worker(object):
    """
    Structure for tracking worker activity and keeping their references.
    """

    def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
        self.id = worker_id
        self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
        self.last_active = last_active if last_active is not None else None  # seconds since epoch
        self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        self.tasks = set()  # task objects
        self.info = {}
```

After applying this fix, the `last_active` attribute will now properly reflect the input parameter value if provided or default to `None` as expected. This correction ensures that the `prune` method and other operations relying on the `last_active` attribute will work correctly.
