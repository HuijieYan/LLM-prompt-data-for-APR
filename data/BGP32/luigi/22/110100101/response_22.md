### Analysis
The buggy function `__init__` in the `Worker` class is not correctly initializing the `last_active` parameter and not pruning tasks based on the worker disconnect delay.

### Bug Cause
- The `last_active` parameter is not being initialized properly, which leads to unexpected behavior when pruning tasks based on the worker disconnect delay.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug
1. Rename the `last_active` parameter in the `__init__` method to `last_active_time`.
2. Initialize the `last_active_time` parameter correctly by storing the current timestamp when the worker is initialized.
3. Implement the `prune` method in the `Worker` class to remove tasks based on the worker disconnect delay.

### Corrected Version
```python
class Worker(object):
    """
    Structure for tracking worker activity and keeping their references.
    """

    def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active_time=None):
        self.id = worker_id
        self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
        self.last_active_time = last_active_time if last_active_time is not None else time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        self.tasks = set()  # task objects
        self.info = {}

    def prune(self, cfg):
        current_time = time.time()
        if current_time - self.last_active_time > cfg.worker_disconnect_delay:
            self.tasks = set()
            self.last_active_time = current_time
```
In the corrected version, I renamed `last_active` to `last_active_time` in the `__init__` method and initialized it properly. I also added the `prune` method to remove tasks based on the worker disconnect delay specified in the configuration.
