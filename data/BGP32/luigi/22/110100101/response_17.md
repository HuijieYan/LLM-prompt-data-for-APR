## Bug Explanation
In the buggy function `__init__`, the `last_active` parameter is assigned the default value of `None`. However, in the failing test `test_worker_prune_after_init`, the `prune` method is called on the `Worker` object with a `TmpCfg` object, which expects the `last_active` attribute to be a float representing seconds since epoch. Since `last_active` is initialized to `None` in the buggy function, it causes a type error later on when trying to access it.

## Bug Fix
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that `last_active` is always initialized correctly as a float representing seconds since epoch. This can be done by modifying the `__init__` method to set the `last_active` parameter to the appropriate value if it is not provided during initialization.

## The corrected buggy function
```python
class Worker(object):
    """
    Structure for tracking worker activity and keeping their references.
    """

    def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
        self.id = worker_id
        self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
        if last_active is not None:
            self.last_active = last_active  # seconds since epoch
        else:
            self.last_active = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        self.tasks = set()  # task objects
        self.info = {}
```

After making this correction, the `last_active` attribute will be set to the current time if no value is provided during initialization, ensuring that it is always a float representing seconds since epoch. This will fix the type error in the failing test.
