The bug in the provided code is that the `prune()` method is being called on the `Worker` instance, but the class definition does not include a `prune()` method. This is causing the test function to fail because it is trying to call a method that does not exist.

To fix this bug, we need to add a `prune()` method to the `Worker` class.

Here is the corrected version of the code:

```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: luigi/scheduler.py

# The declaration of the class containing the buggy function
class Worker(object):
    """
    Structure for tracking worker activity and keeping their references.
    """

    def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
        self.id = worker_id
        self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
        self.last_active = last_active  # seconds since epoch
        self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        self.tasks = set()  # task objects
        self.info = {}

    # Corrected version of the prune() method
    def prune(self, config):
        current_time = time.time()
        if self.last_active is not None and current_time - self.last_active > config.worker_disconnect_delay:
            print("Pruning worker:", self.id)
            self.last_active = None
            self.tasks.clear()
            self.info = {}

```

By adding the `prune()` method to the `Worker` class, we ensure that the test function can successfully call this method without causing an error.

The corrected version retains the initialization steps in the `__init__()` method and adds the `prune()` method to the class. The `prune()` method checks if the worker has been inactive for longer than the specified time in the configuration, and if so, it prunes the worker's tasks and information.

This correction should now pass the failing test by properly handling the worker pruning operation.
