The bug in the `__init__` method of the `Worker` class is that it is not initializing the `last_active` attribute correctly if a value is provided. It is directly assigning the input value to `self.last_active` which is causing the issue. 

To fix this bug, we should check if a value is provided for `last_active`. If a value is provided, we should assign it to `self.last_active`, otherwise we can set it to `None`.

Here is the corrected version of the `__init__` method:

```python
def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
    self.id = worker_id
    self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
    self.last_active = last_active if last_active is not None else None  # seconds since epoch
    self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
    self.tasks = set()  # task objects
    self.info = {}
```

With this correction, the `last_active` attribute will be initialized correctly based on the input provided.

This corrected version of the `__init__` method should now pass the failing test case `test_worker_prune_after_init`.
