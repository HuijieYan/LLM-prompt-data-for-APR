### Analysis
The buggy function `__init__` in the `Worker` class is supposed to initialize a Worker object with specified `worker_id`, `last_active` time (defaulted to None), and other attributes like `started`, `tasks`, and `info`. The bug in this function is that the `last_active` time is always set to the current time when the Worker object is created, instead of using the provided `last_active` parameter.

### Bug
The bug is in the line:
```python
self.last_active = last_active  # seconds since epoch
```
where the `self.last_active` attribute is being assigned the current time instead of the value passed as `last_active`.

### Fix
To fix the bug, the assignment of `last_active` should use the default value only if it is not provided during object creation. Here's the corrected version of the `__init__` function:

```python
    def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
        self.id = worker_id
        self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
        self.last_active = last_active if last_active is not None else time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        self.tasks = set()  # task objects
        self.info = {}
```

By checking if `last_active` is provided, we use the provided time or the current time, as appropriate.

Now, the corrected function should pass the failing test.
