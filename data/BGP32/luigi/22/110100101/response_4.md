### A fixed version of the buggy function

```python
import time

class Worker(object):
    """
    Structure for tracking worker activity and keeping their references.
    """

    def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
        self.id = worker_id
        self.reference = None
        self.last_active = last_active if last_active is not None else time.time()
        self.started = time.time()
        self.tasks = set()
        self.info = {}
``` 

This corrected version fixes the bug by properly initializing the `last_active` attribute using the current time if no value is provided. This ensures that the `last_active` attribute is always set correctly, preventing any potential issues with uninitialized variables.
