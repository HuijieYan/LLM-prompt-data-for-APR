## Analysis
The buggy function `__init__` of the `Worker` class is not handling the `last_active` parameter correctly. It is setting `self.last_active` to the value of `last_active` provided as an argument when creating a new `Worker` instance, but it is not converting it to seconds since epoch, which results in a potential bug. 

## Bug Cause
The bug is caused by not converting the `last_active` parameter to seconds since epoch when initializing the `Worker` instance. This causes inconsistency in the data type for `last_active` as it is expected to be in seconds since epoch, but it is passed as a raw float value.

## Fix
To fix the bug, we need to convert the `last_active` parameter to seconds since epoch in the `__init__` function of the `Worker` class. We can achieve this by using the `time.time()` function to get the current time in seconds since epoch and pass it as an argument to the `Worker` instance if `last_active` is not provided.

## The corrected version of the buggy function
```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: luigi/scheduler.py

# The declaration of the class containing the buggy function
class Worker(object):
    """
    Structure for tracking worker activity and keeping their references.
    """

    def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
        self.id = worker_id
        self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
        self.last_active = last_active if last_active is not None else time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        self.tasks = set()  # task objects
        self.info = {}
```

By making this change, we ensure that the `last_active` parameter is converted to seconds since epoch if it is not provided when creating a new `Worker` instance. This correction addresses the bug in the original implementation.
