## Analysis
The buggy function `__init__` in the `Worker` class is not correctly setting the `last_active` attribute. It is receiving the `last_active` parameter as an argument, but it is not setting it properly. Instead, it is initializing the `last_active` attribute always as `None`. This causes the `last_active` attribute to not be properly initialized with the provided value.

## Bug Cause
The bug is caused by not properly assigning the `last_active` parameter to the `self.last_active` attribute in the `__init__` method of the `Worker` class.

## Bug Fix
To fix the bug, we need to properly assign the `last_active` parameter to the `self.last_active` attribute in the `__init__` method of the `Worker` class.

## The corrected version of the buggy function
```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: luigi/scheduler.py

# The declaration of the class containing the buggy function
class Worker(object):
    """
    Structure for tracking worker activity and keeping their references.
    """

    def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
        self.id = worker_id
        self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
        self.last_active = last_active if last_active is not None else time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        self.tasks = set()  # task objects
        self.info = {}
``` 

By updating the initialization of the `self.last_active` attribute to consider the provided `last_active` parameter, the bug is fixed. The corrected version should now properly initialize the `last_active` attribute with the provided value or the current time if no value is provided.
