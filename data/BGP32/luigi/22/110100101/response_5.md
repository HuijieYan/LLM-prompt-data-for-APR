## Analysis
The buggy function `__init__` in the `Worker` class is not correctly initializing the `last_active` parameter. The `last_active` parameter is taking the default value of `None` if not provided, but it should be initialized to the provided value if it exists.

## Bug Cause
The bug occurs because the `last_active` parameter is not being properly handled in the `__init__` function. Due to this, even though a `last_active` value is provided in the failing test, it is not being utilized in the initialization of the `Worker` object.

## Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to modify the `__init__` function of the `Worker` class to properly initialize the `last_active` attribute using the provided value. We will also update the expected values to reflect this change.

## The corrected version of the buggy function
```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: luigi/scheduler.py

# The declaration of the class containing the corrected function
class Worker(object):
    """
    Structure for tracking worker activity and keeping their references.
    """

    def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
        self.id = worker_id
        self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
        self.last_active = last_active if last_active is not None else time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        self.tasks = set()  # task objects
        self.info = {}
```

Now the `Worker` class will correctly initialize the `last_active` attribute using the provided value if it exists, or the current time as the default value. This will ensure that the failing test passes and the object is properly initialized.
