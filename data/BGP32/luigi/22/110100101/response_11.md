### Analysis
The buggy function `__init__` of the `Worker` class seems to have a bug related to the initialization of the `last_active` attribute. The `last_active` attribute is defaulting to `None` but the failing test expects it to be initialized with a specific value (`1709218610.8782065`).

### Cause of the Bug
The bug is caused by not initializing the `last_active` attribute correctly in the `__init__` method of the `Worker` class.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the `last_active` attribute is initialized correctly in the `__init__` method of the `Worker` class.

### Corrected Version
```python
class Worker(object):
    """
    Structure for tracking worker activity and keeping their references.
    """
    def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
        self.id = worker_id
        self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
        self.last_active = last_active if last_active is not None else time.time() # seconds since epoch
        self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        self.tasks = set()  # task objects
        self.info = {}
``` 

This corrected version ensures that if the `last_active` parameter is not provided during initialization, it defaults to the current time using `time.time()`.
