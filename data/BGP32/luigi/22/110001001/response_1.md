### Explanation of the bug
The bug in the provided function is due to the incorrect initialization of the `last_active` parameter. In the function's current state, the `last_active` parameter defaults to `None`, which can cause issues when trying to manipulate this value later on.

### Strategy for fixing the bug
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the `last_active` parameter is properly initialized to a valid timestamp. We can achieve this by using the current time in seconds since epoch if the parameter is not provided. 

### Corrected version of the function
```python
import time

# The relative path of the buggy file: luigi/scheduler.py

# The declaration of the class containing the corrected function
class Worker(object):
    """
    Structure for tracking worker activity and keeping their references.
    """

    def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
        self.id = worker_id
        self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
        self.last_active = last_active if last_active is not None else time.time()  # seconds since epoch if last_active not provided
        self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        self.tasks = set()  # task objects
        self.info = {}
```

By initializing the `last_active` parameter correctly using the current time when it is not provided, we ensure that the function works as intended without any bugs.
