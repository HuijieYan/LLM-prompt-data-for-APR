The issue in the buggy function is that the `last_active` parameter is not being properly initialized when it is not provided during object creation.

### Cause of the bug:
When the `last_active` parameter is not provided, it defaults to `None`. This leads to a potential bug when comparing it to timestamps calculated using seconds since epoch.

### Strategy for fixing the bug:
We can fix this bug by adding a condition to check if `last_active` is `None` and properly initialize it to the current timestamp in seconds since epoch if that is the case.

### Corrected version of the buggy function:
```python
import time

# The relative path of the buggy file: luigi/scheduler.py

# The declaration of the class containing the buggy function
class Worker(object):
    """
    Structure for tracking worker activity and keeping their references.
    """

    # this is the corrected function
    def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
        self.id = worker_id
        self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
        
        if last_active is None:
            self.last_active = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        else:
            self.last_active = last_active
        
        self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        self.tasks = set()  # task objects
        self.info = {}
``` 

This corrected version ensures that `last_active` is properly initialized to the current timestamp if it is not provided during object creation.
