### Bug Explanation
The bug in the `__init__` function of the `Worker` class is related to the default argument `last_active=None`. When the function is called without explicitly passing a value for `last_active`, it defaults to `None`. However, the issue arises when initializing `self.last_active` with `last_active`, which can end up being `None`. This can lead to ambiguity in distinguishing between an explicitly provided value for `last_active` and the default `None`.

### Bug Fix
To fix this bug, we need to handle the case where `last_active` is `None` separately. It is better to use a sentinel value to represent the absence of a value for `last_active` instead of using `None`.

Here is the corrected version of the `__init__` function:

```python
class Worker(object):
    """
    Structure for tracking worker activity and keeping their references.
    """
    
    def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active_sentinel='Not Specified'):
        self.id = worker_id
        self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
        self.last_active = last_active_sentinel if last_active_sentinel != 'Not Specified' else time.time() 
        self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        self.tasks = set()  # task objects
        self.info = {}
```

By using `last_active_sentinel` with a default value of `'Not Specified'`, we can distinguish between the cases where the caller explicitly provides a value for `last_active` and where the default value is used. This way, there is no ambiguity in the initialization of `self.last_active`.
