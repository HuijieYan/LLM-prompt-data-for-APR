### Analysis
The buggy function `__init__` in the `Worker` class initializes the attributes `id`, `reference`, `last_active`, `started`, `tasks`, and `info`. The bug seems to be related to the `last_active` attribute which is intended to store the time of the worker's last activity, but it is initialized incorrectly.

In the provided runtime values, the `last_active` parameter is set to `None`, which is different from what the expected behavior should be. The `last_active` attribute should default to `None` only if no value is provided during initialization. Instead, it should default to the current time (`time.time()`) if no `last_active` value is provided.

### Bug Cause
The bug occurs because the last_active attribute is not initialized correctly, leading to potential issues when working with this attribute and comparing it against the current time.

### Fix
To fix the bug, we need to modify the `__init__` function to correctly handle the default initialization of the `last_active` attribute.

### Corrected Version
```python
class Worker(object):
    """
    Structure for tracking worker activity and keeping their references.
    """

    def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
        self.id = worker_id
        self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
        self.last_active = last_active if last_active is not None else time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        self.tasks = set()  # task objects
        self.info = {}
``` 

This updated version ensures that if the `last_active` parameter is not provided, it defaults to the current time.
