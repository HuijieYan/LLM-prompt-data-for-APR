The bug in the provided function is that the `last_active` parameter is not properly initialized. It is set to `None` by default, which causes issues when trying to compare it to other time values later in the code.

To fix this bug, we should properly handle the `last_active` parameter by setting it to the current time if it is not provided during initialization. Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
class Worker(object):
    """
    Structure for tracking worker activity and keeping their references.
    """

    def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
        self.id = worker_id
        self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
        self.last_active = last_active if last_active is not None else time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        self.tasks = set()  # task objects
        self.info = {}
```

With this correction, the `last_active` parameter will default to the current time if not explicitly provided, ensuring that comparisons and calculations involving time values work correctly within the class.
