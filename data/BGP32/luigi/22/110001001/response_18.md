The bug in the provided function is that the `last_active` parameter is not being correctly assigned to `self.last_active`. This results in `self.last_active` being set as `None` by default.

### Bug Explanation:
When the `last_active` parameter is not provided during the initialization of the `Worker` class, the default value assigned is `None`. This leads to a potential issue since the functionality of the `Worker` class might rely on keeping track of the last active time of the worker.

### Fix Strategy:
To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the `last_active` parameter is correctly assigned to `self.last_active` during the initialization of the `Worker` class.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
class Worker(object):
    """
    Structure for tracking worker activity and keeping their references.
    """

    def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
        self.id = worker_id
        self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
        self.last_active = last_active if last_active is not None else time.time()  # seconds since epoch or current time
        self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        self.tasks = set()  # task objects
        self.info = {}
```

By making this adjustment, the `last_active` parameter will be correctly assigned to `self.last_active` during the initialization of the `Worker` class. This ensures that the class maintains the desired behavior related to tracking worker activity.
