The bug in the provided function is that the `last_active` parameter is not being properly initialized. In the buggy function, the `last_active` parameter is assigned the default value of `None` in the function signature, but it is not being used correctly in the `__init__` method.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that if `last_active` is not provided during the initialization of the Worker object, it should default to the current time instead of `None`.

Here is the corrected version of the function:
```python
import time

class Worker(object):
    """
    Structure for tracking worker activity and keeping their references.
    """
    
    def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
        self.id = worker_id
        self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
        self.last_active = last_active if last_active is not None else time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        self.tasks = set()  # task objects
        self.info = {}
```

With this correction, if `last_active` is not provided, it will default to the current time when the `Worker` object is initialized.
