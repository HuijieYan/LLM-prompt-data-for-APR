The issue in the buggy function is that the `last_active` parameter is not being properly initialized. It is defaulting to `None`, but it should be set to the current time in seconds since epoch if not provided by the caller.

### Strategy for fixing the bug:
1. Check if the `last_active` parameter is `None` in the `__init__` function.
2. If `last_active` is `None`, set it to the current time using `time.time()`.
3. Update the `__init__` function to correctly handle the initialization of `last_active`.

### Corrected version of the function:
```python
import time

class Worker(object):
    """
    Structure for tracking worker activity and keeping their references.
    """

    def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
        self.id = worker_id
        self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
        if last_active is None:
            self.last_active = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        else:
            self.last_active = last_active
        self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        self.tasks = set()  # task objects
        self.info = {}
```
