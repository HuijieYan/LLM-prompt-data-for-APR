### Explanation
The bug in the `__init__` function is that it's not correctly initializing the `last_active` parameter. The current implementation is using `last_active=None` which means if no value is provided, it defaults to `None` instead of a timestamp.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug
To fix the bug, we can modify the `__init__` function to check if `last_active` is `None` and if so, assign the current timestamp using `time.time()`.

### Corrected Version
```python
class Worker(object):
    """
    Structure for tracking worker activity and keeping their references.
    """

    def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
        self.id = worker_id
        self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
        if last_active is None:
            self.last_active = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        else:
            self.last_active = last_active
        self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        self.tasks = set()  # task objects
        self.info = {}
``` 

By making this modification, the `last_active` parameter will default to the current timestamp if no value is provided, ensuring that it is correctly initialized in all cases.
