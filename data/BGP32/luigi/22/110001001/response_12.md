The bug in the provided function lies in the initialization of the `last_active` attribute using a mutable default value (`None`). 

### Cause of the bug:
When the `last_active` parameter is not provided during the initialization of a `Worker` object, it defaults to `None`. However, the expectation is that if `last_active` is not explicitly provided, it should default to the current time in seconds since epoch. 

### Strategy for fixing the bug:
To fix the bug, we need to modify the `__init__` function of the `Worker` class to set `last_active` to the current time in seconds since epoch when it is not explicitly provided. 

### Corrected version of the function:
```python
class Worker(object):
    def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
        self.id = worker_id
        self.reference = None
        self.last_active = last_active if last_active is not None else time.time()
        self.started = time.time()
        self.tasks = set()
        self.info = {}
```

By making this change, the `last_active` attribute will default to the current time in seconds since epoch when no value is provided, ensuring that the behavior aligns with the expected functionality.
