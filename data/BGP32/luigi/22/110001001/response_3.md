The issue in the provided function is that the `last_active` parameter is set to `None` by default, which causes an unexpected behavior when initializing `self.last_active` as a variable. 

### Cause of the bug:
When the `last_active` parameter is not provided during the initialization of the `Worker` class, it defaults to `None`. This leads to `self.last_active` being set to `None` as well, resulting in a potential inconsistency if calculations are performed using this variable assuming it is a valid timestamp.

### Fix strategy:
To fix the bug, we should check if the `last_active` parameter is `None` when initializing the `self.last_active` variable and handle it appropriately. One common approach is to set `self.last_active` to the current time when `last_active` is `None`, assuming that the worker becomes active at that moment.

### Corrected version:
Here is the corrected version of the `__init__` function within the `Worker` class:

```python
import time

class Worker(object):
    """
    Structure for tracking worker activity and keeping their references.
    """

    def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
        self.id = worker_id
        self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
        if last_active is None:
            self.last_active = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        else:
            self.last_active = last_active
        self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        self.tasks = set()  # task objects
        self.info = {}
```

By incorporating the check for `None` in the `last_active` parameter during initialization, we ensure that the `self.last_active` variable is correctly set to the current time if `last_active` is not provided. This modification addresses the bug and ensures the function behaves as intended.
