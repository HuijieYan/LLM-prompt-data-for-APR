The bug in the provided function lies in the initialization of the `last_active` parameter. Since the default value is set to `None`, it is not effectively being used to track the last active time of the worker.

To fix this bug, we can modify the initialization of `last_active` in the `__init__` function to use the current timestamp if no value is provided. This way, we ensure that `last_active` always holds a valid timestamp.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
import time

class Worker(object):
    """
    Structure for tracking worker activity and keeping their references.
    """

    def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
        self.id = worker_id
        self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
        if last_active is None:
            self.last_active = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        else:
            self.last_active = last_active
        self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        self.tasks = set()  # task objects
        self.info = {}
```

With this modification, the `last_active` parameter will have a valid timestamp even if no value is provided, ensuring correct tracking of worker activity.
