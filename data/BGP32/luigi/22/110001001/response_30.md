The bug in the provided function is related to the default argument `last_active=None` in the `__init__` method of the `Worker` class. The issue arises from mutable default arguments in Python, which can lead to unexpected behavior.

In this case, when an instance of the `Worker` class is created without providing a value for `last_active`, it defaults to `None`. However, since `last_active` is a mutable default argument, the same `last_active` object is shared among all instances of the class. This means that if one instance modifies the `last_active` attribute, it will affect all other instances as well.

To fix this bug, we should avoid using mutable default arguments. Instead, we can initialize `last_active` to `None` within the `__init__` method itself if no value is provided during instantiation.

Here is the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
class Worker(object):
    """
    Structure for tracking worker activity and keeping their references.
    """

    def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
        self.id = worker_id
        self.reference = None
        self.last_active = last_active if last_active is not None else None
        self.started = time.time()
        self.tasks = set()
        self.info = {}
```

By explicitly checking if `last_active` is `None` and assigning it to `self.last_active` only in that case, we ensure that each instance of the `Worker` class has its own independent `last_active` attribute. This fixes the bug related to mutable default arguments and prevents unintended side effects in the program.
