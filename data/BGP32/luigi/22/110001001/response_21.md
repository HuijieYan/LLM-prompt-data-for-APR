The bug in the provided function is that the `last_active` parameter is not being correctly initialized. In the `__init__` function of the `Worker` class, the `last_active` parameter is being set to `None` by default, but it should be initialized with the current time if no value is provided.

### Fixing the bug
To fix this bug, we need to modify the `__init__` function to properly initialize the `last_active` parameter. We can achieve this by checking if the `last_active` parameter is `None` and if so, setting it to the current time using `time.time()`.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
import time

# The relative path of the buggy file: luigi/scheduler.py

# The declaration of the class containing the buggy function
class Worker(object):
    """
    Structure for tracking worker activity and keeping their references.
    """

    def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
        self.id = worker_id
        self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
        
        if last_active is None:
            self.last_active = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        else:
            self.last_active = last_active
        
        self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        self.tasks = set()  # task objects
        self.info = {}
```

With this correction, the `last_active` parameter will be correctly initialized with the current time if no value is provided, ensuring that the function works as intended.
