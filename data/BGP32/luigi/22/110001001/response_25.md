The bug in the provided function is that the `last_active` parameter is not properly initialized. It is being set to the default value `None`, but it should be initialized to the current time in seconds since epoch if no value is provided.

### Strategy for fixing the bug:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that `last_active` is set to the current time if no value is provided. We can achieve this by modifying the `__init__` function as follows:

```python
import time

class Worker(object):
    """
    Structure for tracking worker activity and keeping their references.
    """

    def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
        self.id = worker_id
        self.reference = None
        self.last_active = last_active if last_active is not None else time.time()
        self.started = time.time()
        self.tasks = set()
        self.info = {}
```

This modification checks if the `last_active` parameter is provided. If it is not provided (`None`), then it sets `last_active` to the current time using `time.time()`. This ensures that the `last_active` attribute is properly initialized in all cases.
