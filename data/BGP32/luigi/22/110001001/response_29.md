The bug in the provided function is that the `last_active` parameter is not correctly assigned to the `last_active` attribute of the `Worker` class instance. Instead, it is assigned directly to the `self.last_active` attribute. This causes the `last_active` attribute to always retain the default value of `None`, regardless of the input provided.

To fix this bug, the `last_active` parameter should be assigned to the `last_active` attribute. Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
class Worker(object):
    """
    Structure for tracking worker activity and keeping their references.
    """

    def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
        self.id = worker_id
        self.reference = None
        self.last_active = last_active if last_active is not None else time.time()  # assign last_active parameter if provided, else assign current time
        self.started = time.time()
        self.tasks = set()
        self.info = {}
```

With this correction, the `last_active` attribute will now properly take the value provided as the `last_active` parameter when initializing a `Worker` instance.
