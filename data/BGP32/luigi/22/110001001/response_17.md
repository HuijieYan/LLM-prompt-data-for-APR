The bug in the provided function is that the default argument `last_active=None` is not actually setting `last_active` to `None` when no value is passed while creating an instance of the Worker class. This can lead to unexpected behavior when checking the value of `last_active` later in the code.

To fix the bug, we need to explicitly set `last_active` to `None` if no value is provided when creating an instance of the Worker class.

Here is the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
class Worker(object):
    """
    Structure for tracking worker activity and keeping their references.
    """
    
    def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
        self.id = worker_id
        self.reference = None
        self.last_active = last_active if last_active is not None else None
        self.started = time.time()
        self.tasks = set()
        self.info = {}
```

By explicitly checking if `last_active` is not `None`, we ensure that the default value of `None` is assigned to `self.last_active` if no value is provided during object creation. This fix ensures consistent behavior and prevents unexpected issues related to the default argument.
