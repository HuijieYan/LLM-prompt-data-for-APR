The issue in the buggy function lies in the way the `last_active` parameter is assigned in the `__init__` method. The `last_active` parameter defaults to `None`, but it should default to the current time in seconds since epoch if no value is passed.

### Bug Cause:
In the current implementation, the `last_active` parameter is not updated if the default value is used, leading to a potential inconsistency in the initialization of the `last_active` attribute.

### Fix:
To fix this bug, you should check if `last_active` is `None` in the `__init__` method and assign the current time if it is. Here is the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
class Worker(object):
    """
    Structure for tracking worker activity and keeping their references.
    """

    def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
        self.id = worker_id
        self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
        self.last_active = last_active if last_active is not None else time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        self.tasks = set()  # task objects
        self.info = {}
```

With this fix, the `last_active` attribute will default to the current time in seconds since epoch if no value is provided, ensuring that it is always properly initialized.
