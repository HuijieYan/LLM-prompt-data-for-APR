The bug in the provided function is that the `last_active` parameter is not being properly assigned when passed as an argument. The `last_active` parameter is intended to track the time of the last activity of the worker, but if it is not provided during initialization, it should default to `None`.

### Cause of the bug:
In the buggy function, `last_active` is assigned the default value of `None`, but it is not properly handling the case when a value is passed as an argument. This results in the `last_active` parameter not being updated correctly.

### Fix strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to modify the `__init__` function to properly handle the `last_active` parameter when provided. We can check if a value is provided for `last_active` and update the instance variable accordingly.

### Corrected version of the function:
```python
class Worker(object):
    """
    Structure for tracking worker activity and keeping their references.
    """

    def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
        self.id = worker_id
        self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
        self.last_active = last_active if last_active is not None else time.time()  # seconds since epoch or current time
        self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        self.tasks = set()  # task objects
        self.info = {}
```

This corrected version of the function now properly handles the `last_active` parameter, assigning the current time when no value is provided.
