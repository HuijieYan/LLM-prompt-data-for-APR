### Explanation:
The bug in the provided code is that the `last_active` parameter is not being assigned properly in the `__init__` function. When the `last_active` parameter is not provided, it defaults to `None`, but then it is not being properly assigned to the `last_active` attribute.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we should ensure that when the `last_active` parameter is provided, it should be assigned to the `last_active` attribute, otherwise it should default to `None`.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
class Worker(object):
    """
    Structure for tracking worker activity and keeping their references.
    """

    def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
        self.id = worker_id
        self.reference = None
        self.last_active = last_active if last_active is not None else None
        self.started = time.time()
        self.tasks = set()
        self.info = {}
```

By making this change, the `last_active` attribute will correctly take the value of the `last_active` parameter when provided, otherwise it will default to `None`.
