The bug in the provided function is that the `last_active` parameter is not being assigned properly. It is initialized correctly with a default value of `None`, but it is not being assigned to the `last_active` variable inside the `__init__` function.

### Cause of the bug:
The bug is caused by not assigning the `last_active` parameter to the `last_active` variable inside the `__init__` function. As a result, `last_active` remains `None`, even if a value is passed as an argument.

### Fix strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to assign the `last_active` parameter to the `last_active` variable inside the `__init__` function. This can be done by adding the assignment statement `self.last_active = last_active` in the `__init__` function.

### Corrected version of the function:
```python
class Worker(object):
    """
    Structure for tracking worker activity and keeping their references.
    """

    def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
        self.id = worker_id
        self.reference = None
        self.last_active = last_active if last_active is not None else time.time()
        self.started = time.time()
        self.tasks = set()
        self.info = {}
``` 

By making this change, the `last_active` parameter will be correctly assigned to the `last_active` variable, either with the provided value or the current time if no value is provided.
