The bug in the provided `__init__` function of the `Worker` class is that the `last_active` parameter is set to a mutable default value (`None`). This can lead to unexpected behavior because mutable default values are shared between all instances of the class.

### Explanation of the bug
In the bug scenario where the worker ID is passed as `123`, the `last_active` parameter is set to `None`, but the function initializes `self.last_active` as `last_active`, which results in all instances sharing the same default `last_active` value of `None`. This can lead to unintended interactions between different instances of the `Worker` class.

### Strategy for fixing the bug
To fix this bug, it's important to avoid using mutable default values in function parameters. Instead, explicitly check if `last_active` is `None` inside the `__init__` function and assign a default value at that point. This ensures that each instance of the `Worker` class has its own `last_active`.

### Corrected version of the `__init__` function
```python
def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
    self.id = worker_id
    self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
    if last_active is None:
        self.last_active = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
    else:
        self.last_active = last_active
    self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
    self.tasks = set()  # task objects
    self.info = {}
```

By making this change, each instance of the `Worker` class will have its own `last_active` value based on either the provided parameter or the current time if no value is provided.
