The bug in the provided function is that the `last_active` parameter is not properly handled. The `last_active` parameter is supposed to be set as the time in seconds since the epoch when the worker was last active, but the default value of `None` is causing issues.

The bug causes the `last_active` attribute to always be initialized as `None`, which is not the intended behavior.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the `__init__` function to properly handle the `last_active` parameter. We can use a conditional statement to check if `last_active` is provided. If it is not provided, we can set `last_active` to the current time in seconds since the epoch.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
import time

class Worker(object):
    """
    Structure for tracking worker activity and keeping their references.
    """

    def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
        self.id = worker_id
        self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
        if last_active is None:
            self.last_active = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        else:
            self.last_active = last_active
        self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        self.tasks = set()  # task objects
        self.info = {}
```

With this correction, the `last_active` parameter will be properly handled, and the function will work as intended.
