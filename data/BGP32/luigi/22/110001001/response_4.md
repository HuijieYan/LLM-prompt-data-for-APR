The bug in the provided function is with the default value assignment in the `__init__` method. The `last_active=None` parameter is intended to have a default value of `None`, but the issue arises when the function is called with the `worker_id` parameter.

When `worker_id` is provided, the `last_active` parameter is mistakenly assigned the value of `worker_id` instead of `None`. This results in unexpected behavior where the `last_active` parameter is set to a non-None value even when not explicitly provided.

To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the `last_active` parameter defaults to `None` when no value is explicitly provided. Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
class Worker(object):
    """
    Structure for tracking worker activity and keeping their references.
    """

    def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
        self.id = worker_id
        self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
        self.last_active = last_active if last_active is not None else None  # seconds since epoch
        self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        self.tasks = set()  # task objects
        self.info = {}
```

With this correction, the `last_active` parameter will default to `None` when no value is provided during initialization.
