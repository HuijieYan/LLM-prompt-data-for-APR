The bug in the provided function is related to the initialization of the `last_active` parameter. The `last_active` parameter is set to `None` by default, but it should be set to the current time in seconds since epoch if no value is provided.

### Strategy for fixing the bug:
We need to update the `__init__` function to check if `last_active` is `None`, and if it is, set it to the current time in seconds since epoch.

### Corrected version of the function:
```python
import time

class Worker(object):
    """
    Structure for tracking worker activity and keeping their references.
    """

    def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
        self.id = worker_id
        self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
        self.last_active = last_active if last_active is not None else time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        self.tasks = set()  # task objects
        self.info = {}
```

This correction ensures that if the `last_active` parameter is not provided during initialization, it will be set to the current time in seconds since epoch.
