The bug in the code appears to be in the `__init__` function of the `Worker` class. The issue lies in the default argument for the `last_active` parameter in the function signature.

The `last_active` parameter is set to `None` in the function definition. However, when the function is called, the value is not explicitly passed in, causing `last_active` to remain as `None`. This results in an error when trying to access the `self.last_active` attribute later on in the function.

To fix this issue, we can specify a default value of `None` for `last_active` in the function signature. Here is the corrected version of the `__init__` function:

```python
def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
    self.id = worker_id
    self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
    self.last_active = last_active if last_active is not None else time.time()  # seconds since epoch
    self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
    self.tasks = set()  # task objects
    self.info = {}
```

By making this change, the `last_active` parameter will default to the current time in seconds since epoch if no value is provided, avoiding the `None` value issue.
