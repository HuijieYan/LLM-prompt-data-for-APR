The bug in the provided function is that it initializes the `last_active` parameter with a mutable default argument (`None`). This can lead to unexpected behavior because mutable default arguments are shared across all instances of the class. In this case, if `last_active` is changed in one instance, it will affect all other instances as well.

To fix this bug, we should initialize `last_active` inside the `__init__` function instead of as a default parameter.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
class Worker(object):
    """
    Structure for tracking worker activity and keeping their references.
    """

    def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
        self.id = worker_id
        self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
        if last_active is None:
            self.last_active = None
        else:
            self.last_active = last_active
        self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        self.tasks = set()  # task objects
        self.info = {}
```

By initializing `last_active` inside the `__init__` function, we ensure that each instance of the class has its own `last_active` attribute, avoiding potential issues caused by mutable default arguments.
