### 3. Explanation of the bug
In the given buggy function, the `last_active` parameter is supposed to represent the time (in seconds since epoch) when the worker was last active. However, the bug occurs because the `last_active` parameter is initialized incorrectly. The default value of `last_active` is set to `None` in the function signature, but it should be handled properly to avoid potential issues when working with time calculations.

### 4. Strategy for fixing the bug
To fix the bug, we need to handle the default case properly in the `__init__` method. We should check if the `last_active` parameter is provided during the object creation. If it is not provided (`None`), we can set the initial `last_active` time to the same value as `self.started` which is the time when the worker object is created.

### Corrected version of the buggy function
```python
import time

class Worker(object):
    """
    Structure for tracking worker activity and keeping their references.
    """

    def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
        self.id = worker_id
        self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
        if last_active is None:
            self.last_active = time.time()  # set to current time if last_active is not provided
        else:
            self.last_active = last_active
        self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        self.tasks = set()  # task objects
        self.info = {}
```

By adding a condition to handle the case where `last_active` is `None`, we ensure that the last active time is correctly initialized based on the provided information or the current time if not provided. This fix addresses the bug in the original function.
