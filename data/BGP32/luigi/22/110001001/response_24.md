### Explanation of the bug
The bug in the provided Worker class's `__init__` function is that the `last_active` parameter is not correctly assigned to the `self.last_active` instance variable. The `last_active` parameter is being set to the same initial value as `self.started`, which is the current time in seconds since epoch, instead of being set to the value passed as an argument.

### Strategy for fixing the bug
To fix the bug, the `last_active` parameter should be assigned to the `self.last_active` instance variable instead of setting it to the current time in seconds since epoch.

### Corrected version of the buggy function
```python
class Worker(object):
    """
    Structure for tracking worker activity and keeping their references.
    """

    def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
        self.id = worker_id
        self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
        self.last_active = last_active  # set the provided last_active value
        self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        self.tasks = set()  # task objects
        self.info = {}
``` 

By updating the initialization of `self.last_active` to the value of the `last_active` parameter passed to the constructor, the corrected function ensures that the `last_active` value provided at runtime is correctly stored in the `Worker` instance.
