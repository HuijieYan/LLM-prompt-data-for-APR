### Analysis
The bug in the `__init__` function of the `Worker` class is that the `last_active` parameter is not being correctly assigned. Instead of using the provided `last_active` parameter if it is not None, it is defaulting to `None` in the current implementation. This leads to incorrect behavior when the `prune` method is called with an instance of `TmpCfg` where `worker_disconnect_delay` is set to `10`.

### Bug Cause
The bug occurs because the `last_active` parameter is not being properly initialized in the `__init__` function of the `Worker` class. This causes the `worker.last_active` value to be `None` instead of the expected value of `10` when the `prune` method is called.

### Fix Strategy
To fix this bug, we need to modify the `__init__` function of the `Worker` class to correctly assign the `last_active` parameter passed during initialization.

### Corrected Version
```python
# The corrected version of the buggy function
def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
    self.id = worker_id
    self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
    self.last_active = last_active if last_active is not None else time.time()  # seconds since epoch or provided value
    self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
    self.tasks = set()  # task objects
    self.info = {}
```

After applying this correction, the `last_active` parameter will be correctly initialized in the `Worker` class, and the test case `test_worker_prune_after_init` should pass successfully.
