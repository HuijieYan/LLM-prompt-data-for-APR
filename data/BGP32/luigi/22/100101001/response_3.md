The bug in the provided `__init__` function is that the `last_active` parameter is not being assigned correctly. It is being assigned to the `self.last_active` attribute without any validation or conversion. 

The `last_active` parameter should be converted to the seconds since epoch format before assigning it to `self.last_active`. If `last_active` is `None`, it should default to `None`. 

Here is the corrected version of the `__init__` function:

```python
def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
    self.id = worker_id
    self.reference = None
    self.last_active = last_active if last_active is None else time.mktime(last_active.timetuple())
    self.started = time.time()
    self.tasks = set()
    self.info = {}
```

By converting the `last_active` parameter to seconds since epoch using `time.mktime(last_active.timetuple())`, we ensure that the assignment is correct and consistent with the expected operation.
