The issue in the buggy function is that the `__init__` function is missing the `self` parameter in its argument list. This leads to an error when the worker object is initialized and the `prune` method is called.

The corrected version of the `__init__` function should include the `self` parameter, like this:

```python
def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
    self.id = worker_id
    self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
    self.last_active = last_active  # seconds since epoch
    self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
    self.tasks = set()  # task objects
    self.info = {}
```

With this correction, the worker object will be properly initialized and the `prune` method should work correctly.

After fixing the bug, the `prune` method in the test file should be able to execute without errors.
