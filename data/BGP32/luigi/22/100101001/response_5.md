### Analysis
The `prune` method is being called on the `Worker` instance without initializing the `last_active` parameter in the `__init__` method. This results in the `self.last_active` being `None`, leading to potential issues in the `prune` method.

### Bug Explanation
The bug occurs because the `last_active` parameter is not correctly initialized in the `__init__` method of the `Worker` class. When the `prune` method is called, it expects `last_active` to be a valid timestamp, but since it is initialized as `None`, it causes issues in the logic of the `prune` method.

### Fix Strategy
To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the `last_active` parameter is properly initialized in the `__init__` method of the `Worker` class. We can initialize it with the current time if no value is provided, ensuring that it is a valid timestamp.

### Corrected Version
```python
# The corrected version of the buggy function
def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
    self.id = worker_id
    self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
    self.last_active = last_active if last_active is not None else time.time()  # seconds since epoch
    self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
    self.tasks = set()  # task objects
    self.info = {}
``` 

By initializing `last_active` with the current time if no value is provided, we ensure that it is always a valid timestamp, fixing the bug in the `Worker` class.
