### Bug Explanation
The bug in the `__init__` method of the `Worker` class is that the `last_active` parameter is not being assigned properly. The `last_active` parameter is passed to the constructor but not assigned to the `self.last_active` attribute correctly. This causes the `last_active` attribute to remain `None` even when a value is provided, leading to potential issues later on when comparing or using the `last_active` attribute.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix this bug, we need to correctly assign the `last_active` parameter to the `self.last_active` attribute inside the `__init__` method.

### Corrected Version
```python
# The corrected version of the buggy function
def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
    self.id = worker_id
    self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
    self.last_active = last_active if last_active is not None else time.time()  # seconds since epoch
    self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
    self.tasks = set()  # task objects
    self.info = {}
```

By checking if the `last_active` parameter is not None, we assign it to the `self.last_active` attribute. Otherwise, we set it to the current time using `time.time()`. This ensures that the `last_active` attribute is correctly initialized in the `Worker` object.
