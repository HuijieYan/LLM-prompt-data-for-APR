The bug in the provided code is that the `prune` method is being called on the `Worker` instance without initializing the `last_active` attribute in the constructor of the `Worker` class. This leads to an issue because the `prune` method attempts to use the `last_active` attribute, which may not exist.

To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the `last_active` attribute is properly initialized in the `__init__` method of the `Worker` class.

Here is the corrected version of the `__init__` method in the `Worker` class:

```python
# The relative path of the fixed file: luigi/scheduler.py

# corrected version of the buggy function
def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
    self.id = worker_id
    self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
    self.last_active = last_active if last_active is not None else time.time()  # seconds since epoch
    self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
    self.tasks = set()  # task objects
    self.info = {}
```

By initializing the `last_active` attribute in the `__init__` method with the value provided or `time.time()` if no value is provided, we ensure that the `prune` method can operate correctly without encountering unexpected behavior due to missing attributes or incorrect initialization.

This corrected version of the `__init__` method should now pass the failing test case provided.
