The issue in the buggy function `__init__` is that it lacks the necessary logic to handle the `last_active` parameter correctly when initializing a `Worker` object. As a result, the `prune` method is failing in the test because it expects the `last_active` attribute to be set properly but it remains as `None`.

To fix this bug, we should update the `__init__` function to properly initialize the `last_active` attribute based on the input parameter. If `last_active` is not provided, it should default to `None`.

Here is the corrected version of the `__init__` function:

```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: luigi/scheduler.py

# Corrected version of the buggy function
def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
    self.id = worker_id
    self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
    self.last_active = last_active if last_active is not None else time.time()  # seconds since epoch
    self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
    self.tasks = set()  # task objects
    self.info = {}
```

This correction ensures that if `last_active` is not provided during the initialization of a `Worker` object, it will default to the current time using `time.time()`.

With this fix in place, the failing test `test_worker_prune_after_init` should now pass successfully.
