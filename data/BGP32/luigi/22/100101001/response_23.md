The bug in the provided function is that the `prune` method is called in the test code but the `prune` method is not defined in the `Worker` class. This causes the test to fail because the method being called does not exist. 

To fix this bug, we need to define the `prune` method in the `Worker` class in the `luigi/scheduler.py` file. We can make the `prune` method initialize the `last_active` attribute of the `Worker` instance to the current time. 

Here is the corrected version of the `Worker` class with the `prune` method added:

```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: luigi/scheduler.py

import time

class Worker:
    def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
        self.id = worker_id
        self.reference = None
        self.last_active = last_active
        self.started = time.time()
        self.tasks = set()
        self.info = {}

    def prune(self, config):
        self.last_active = time.time()
```

After adding the `prune` method to the `Worker` class, the failing test should now pass successfully.
