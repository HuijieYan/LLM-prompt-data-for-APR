The bug in the provided `__init__` function is that the `last_active` parameter is not properly initialized. It is set to the default value of `None`, but it should default to the current time in seconds since epoch if no value is provided.

### Bug Explanation:
When the `last_active` parameter is not provided, it defaults to `None`. However, the `prune` method called in the failing test function uses the `last_active` value as a comparison in the logic, causing unexpected behavior due to `None` comparisons.

### Bug Fix:
To fix the bug, the `last_active` parameter should default to the current time in seconds since epoch if no value is provided. This will ensure consistency in comparisons within the `prune` method.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
    self.id = worker_id
    self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
    self.last_active = last_active if last_active is not None else time.time()  # seconds since epoch
    self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
    self.tasks = set()  # task objects
    self.info = {}
```
