### Bug Explanation
The bug in the `__init__` function of the `Worker` class is that it is missing the `self` parameter. Due to this, when the `Worker` object is created in the test function, the `prune` method is called on the class instead of an instance of the `Worker` class. This results in an attribute error when trying to access `self.id` within the `__init__` function.

### Bug Fix
To fix this issue, we need to make sure that the `__init__` function has the correct parameters including `self`. By adding `self` as the first parameter in the function definition, the instance of the class will be correctly initialized with the provided attributes.

### Corrected Version
```python
# The corrected version of the buggy function
def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
    self.id = worker_id
    self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
    self.last_active = last_active  # seconds since epoch
    self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
    self.tasks = set()  # task objects
    self.info = {}
``` 

By adding `self` as the first parameter in the function definition, the corrected version of the function should now work properly when creating instances of the `Worker` class.
