### Bug Explanation
The bug in the `__init__` function of the `Worker` class is that it is missing the `self` parameter in its definition. In Python, when defining a class method, the first parameter should always be `self` to reference the instance of the class.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix this bug, we need to add the `self` parameter to the function definition so that the instance of the `Worker` class is properly referenced within the method.

### Corrected Version
```python
def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
    self.id = worker_id
    self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
    self.last_active = last_active  # seconds since epoch
    self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
    self.tasks = set()  # task objects
    self.info = {}
``` 

### Updated Version
```python
class Worker:
    def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
        self.id = worker_id
        self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
        self.last_active = last_active  # seconds since epoch
        self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        self.tasks = set()  # task objects
        self.info = {}
```

With this corrected version, the `__init__` function now properly includes the `self` parameter, ensuring that the class instance is correctly referenced and the test should pass successfully.
