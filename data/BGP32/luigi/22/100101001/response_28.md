The bug in the `Worker` class initialization lies in the fact that the method `prune` is being called directly after creating a `Worker` instance, which is not properly handled in the `__init__` method leading to the bug.

The `prune` method is expecting a `Worker` instance to have a `last_active` attribute, which is not set during the `__init__` method. This causes the failure of the `test_worker_prune_after_init` test since the `prune` method tries to access the `last_active` attribute, which is not set.

To fix this bug, we can set the `last_active` attribute during the initialization of the `Worker` class. Here is the corrected version of the `__init__` method:

```python
def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
    self.id = worker_id
    self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
    if last_active is None:
        self.last_active = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
    else:
        self.last_active = last_active
    self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
    self.tasks = set()  # task objects
    self.info = {}
```

By setting the `last_active` attribute conditionally in the `__init__` method, we ensure that it is properly initialized either with the provided value or with the current time if no value is given. This will address the bug and allow the `prune` method to work correctly.
