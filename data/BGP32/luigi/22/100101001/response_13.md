The bug in the provided `__init__` function is that it takes the `last_active` parameter as an optional argument but does not properly assign it to the instance variable if a value is provided. This leads to the `last_active` being None even if a value is passed, causing potential issues later in the code.

### Explanation of the bug:
In the failing test `test_worker_prune_after_init`, an instance of `Worker` is created with id `123` but the `prune` method is called on it immediately after initialization. The prune method uses the `worker.last_active` attribute, which is initialized to None in the `__init__` method regardless of the value provided.

### Fix strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to properly assign the `last_active` parameter to the instance variable `self.last_active` in the `__init__` method. This can be achieved by checking if the `last_active` parameter is provided, and if so, assigning it to `self.last_active`.

### Corrected version of the `__init__` function:
```python
def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
    self.id = worker_id
    self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
    self.last_active = last_active if last_active is not None else time.time()  # seconds since epoch
    self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
    self.tasks = set()  # task objects
    self.info = {}
```

By applying this fix, the `last_active` parameter will be correctly assigned to the `self.last_active` instance variable if a value is provided, resolving the bug and ensuring that the failing test `test_worker_prune_after_init` passes successfully.
