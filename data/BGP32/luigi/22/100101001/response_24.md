The bug in the provided function `__init__` lies in the fact that the `last_active` parameter is not being initialized correctly. In the function definition, `last_active` is set to `None` by default, but it is being overridden by the `started` attribute, which is initialized with `time.time()`. This leads to `worker.last_active` being equal to the current time in seconds rather than `None`.

To fix this bug, we should initialize `self.last_active` only if `last_active` parameter is None. Otherwise, we should set it to the provided `last_active` value.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
    self.id = worker_id
    self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
    
    if last_active is None:
        self.last_active = None
    else:
        self.last_active = last_active
        
    self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
    self.tasks = set()  # task objects
    self.info = {}
```

With this correction, the function will now correctly handle the initialization of the `last_active` attribute based on the input parameter value. This fix should ensure that the failing test `test_worker_prune_after_init` passes successfully.
