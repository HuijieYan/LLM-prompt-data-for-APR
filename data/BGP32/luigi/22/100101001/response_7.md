### Potential Error Location
The error in the `__init__` function seems to be related to the `last_active` parameter. When calling the `prune` method in the test, it expects the worker to have the `last_active` attribute set in order to compare it with the current time and disconnect delay. However, in the `__init__` function, the `last_active` parameter is not being properly assigned.

### Cause of the Bug
The bug is caused by the `last_active` parameter not being assigned correctly in the `__init__` function. As a result, when calling the `prune` method in the test, the comparison with the disconnect delay fails because `last_active` remains `None`.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug
To fix the bug, you need to properly assign the `last_active` parameter in the `__init__` function. If `last_active` is not provided, it should default to `None`. This will ensure that the `prune` method can correctly compare the last active time of the worker with the disconnect delay.

### Corrected Version of the Function
```python
def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
    self.id = worker_id
    self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
    self.last_active = last_active if last_active is not None else time.time()  # seconds since epoch or default to current time
    self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
    self.tasks = set()  # task objects
    self.info = {}
``` 

By making this change, the `last_active` parameter is properly handled in the initialization of the Worker class, and the failing test `test_worker_prune_after_init` should pass successfully.
