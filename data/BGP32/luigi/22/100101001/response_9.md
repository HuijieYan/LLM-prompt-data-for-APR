The bug in the provided `__init__` function is that the `last_active` parameter is not being properly assigned if it is provided as an argument. This results in the `last_active` variable always being `None`, leading to incorrect behavior in the rest of the code.

### Cause of the Bug
The bug stems from the fact that the `last_active` parameter is not correctly assigned in the `__init__` function. Since it defaults to `None`, the provided `last_active` value is not utilized, causing issues in the subsequent code execution.

### Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the `last_active` parameter, if provided, is properly assigned during the initialization of the `Worker` object.

### Corrected Version
Here is the corrected version of the `__init__` function:

```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: luigi/scheduler.py

def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
    self.id = worker_id
    self.reference = None
    self.last_active = last_active if last_active is not None else time.time()
    self.started = time.time()
    self.tasks = set()
    self.info = {}
```

By checking if `last_active` is not `None`, we assign the provided value. If not provided, it defaults to the current time. This correction ensures that the `last_active` variable gets the correct value and the subsequent code behavior is as intended.
