The issue in the buggy function lies in the initialization of the `last_active` parameter. In the `__init__` function, the `last_active` parameter is set to `None` by default. However, in the failing test `test_worker_prune_after_init`, the `prune` method is called on the worker object which expects the `last_active` attribute to be a valid integer representing the time since epoch.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is occurring because the `last_active` parameter is not being set to a valid integer value when the worker object is created, leading to an error in the `prune` method which expects a valid time parameter.

### Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the `last_active` parameter is either set to a valid integer representing the seconds since epoch or initialize it to a default value if not provided during object creation.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
    self.id = worker_id
    self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
    self.last_active = last_active if last_active is not None else int(time.time())  # seconds since epoch
    self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
    self.tasks = set()  # task objects
    self.info = {}
```

By initializing the `last_active` parameter to the current time in seconds since epoch if it is not provided during object creation, we ensure that the `prune` method in the failing test will not encounter an error related to the `last_active` attribute.
