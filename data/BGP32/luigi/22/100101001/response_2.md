The bug in the provided `__init__` function is that the `last_active` parameter is not being properly initialized. It is currently set to `None`, and this can cause issues when trying to compare `last_active` with a timestamp in the prune function. 

To fix this bug, we need to initialize `self.last_active` properly by checking if it is `None` and setting it to the current timestamp (`time.time()`) if it is. 

Here is the corrected version of the `__init__` function:

```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: luigi/scheduler.py

import time

def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
    self.id = worker_id
    self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
    
    if last_active is None:
        self.last_active = time.time()
    else:
        self.last_active = last_active
    
    self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
    self.tasks = set()  # task objects
    self.info = {}
```

This corrected version checks if `last_active` is `None` and sets it to the current timestamp using `time.time()` if it is. This ensures that `last_active` is properly initialized and prevents any issues related to comparing it in the `prune` function.

With this correction in place, the failing test `test_worker_prune_after_init` should now pass.
