The bug in the provided function is that the `last_active` parameter is not properly assigned to the `last_active` attribute of the `Worker` class instance. Instead, it remains `None` and causes issues when the `prune` method is called later.

To fix this bug, we need to correctly assign the `last_active` parameter to the `last_active` attribute in the `__init__` method of the `Worker` class.

Here is the corrected version of the `__init__` method:

```python
# The corrected version of the buggy function
def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
    self.id = worker_id
    self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
    self.last_active = last_active if last_active is not None else time.time()  # seconds since epoch
    self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
    self.tasks = set()  # task objects
    self.info = {}
```

By checking if the `last_active` parameter is `None`, we can properly assign the current time using `time.time()` if no value is provided. This ensures that the `last_active` attribute is correctly initialized.

With this fix, the failing test `test_worker_prune_after_init` should now pass.
