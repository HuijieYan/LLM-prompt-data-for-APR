The buggy function `__init__` is missing the `self` parameter in its definition. This leads to an error when creating a new instance of the `Worker` class, as the `self` parameter is not being passed implicitly.

To fix this bug, simply add the `self` parameter to the `__init__` function definition.

Here is the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
# The corrected version of the buggy function
def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
    self.id = worker_id
    self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
    self.last_active = last_active  # seconds since epoch
    self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
    self.tasks = set()  # task objects
    self.info = {}
```

With this correction, the test function `test_worker_prune_after_init` should now pass successfully.
