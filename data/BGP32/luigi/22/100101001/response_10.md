The bug in the provided code is that the `prune()` method is not defined for the `Worker` class, which causes the failing test `test_worker_prune_after_init` to raise an AttributeError.

To fix this issue, we need to define the `prune()` method in the `Worker` class. The `prune()` method typically removes inactive workers based on a specified delay time. 

Here is the corrected version of the buggy function with the `prune()` method added:

```python
class Worker:
    def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
        self.id = worker_id
        self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
        self.last_active = last_active  # seconds since epoch
        self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        self.tasks = set()  # task objects
        self.info = {}

    def prune(self, config):
        current_time = time.time()
        if self.last_active is not None and current_time - self.last_active > config.worker_disconnect_delay:
            # Remove the worker if it has been inactive for longer than the specified delay
            # This is just a placeholder action for pruning, actual implementation may vary
            print(f"Pruning worker {self.id}")
            self.tasks.clear()
            self.reference = None
```

Now the `Worker` class includes the `prune()` method, which checks if the worker has been inactive for a period longer than the specified delay in the configuration and performs some pruning action.

With this correction, the failing test `test_worker_prune_after_init` should pass without raising any errors related to the missing `prune()` method.
