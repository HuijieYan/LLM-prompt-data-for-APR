### Analysis:
The buggy function `__init__` in the `Worker` class initializes the attributes `last_active`, `started`, `tasks`, and `info`. The failing test `test_worker_prune_after_init` tries to call the `prune` method on a `Worker` object. The error occurs because `self.last_active` is initialized as `None`, and when trying to add `config.worker_disconnect_delay` to it, a `TypeError` is raised.

### Bug Cause:
The bug occurs because `self.last_active` is initialized as `None`, and the code does not handle this case properly when comparing and adding it to an integer value (`config.worker_disconnect_delay`).

### Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to check if `self.last_active` is `None` before trying to perform operations on it. If it is `None`, we should handle it appropriately to avoid the `TypeError`.

### Updated Corrected Version:
```python
def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
    self.id = worker_id
    self.reference = None
    self.last_active = last_active if last_active is not None else time.time()
    self.started = time.time()
    self.tasks = set()
    self.info = {}
```

With this fix, the `__init__` function checks if `last_active` is `None` and assigns the current timestamp using `time.time()` if it is `None`. This modification ensures that the comparison and addition operations in the subsequent code will not raise a `TypeError`.
