### Bug Analysis:
The error occurs in the `prune()` method when trying to add a `NoneType` (self.last_active) with an integer (`config.worker_disconnect_delay`) in the condition check. This happens because the `last_active` parameter in the constructor of the `Worker` class is set to default as `None`, but it should be initialized to the current time if not provided explicitly.

### Bug Fix:
Initialize `self.last_active` in the `__init__` method with the provided `last_active` value or the current time if it's None.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
    self.id = worker_id
    self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
    self.last_active = last_active if last_active is not None else time.time()  # seconds since epoch
    self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
    self.tasks = set()  # task objects
    self.info = {}
```
