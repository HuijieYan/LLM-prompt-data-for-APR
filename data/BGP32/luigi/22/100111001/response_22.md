The issue in the buggy function arises from the fact that `last_active` is initialized as `None`, and when trying to add an integer value to `None`, a TypeError occurs.

### Bug Explanation
1. In the failing test `test_worker_prune_after_init`, the Worker object is instantiated with `worker = luigi.scheduler.Worker(123)`
2. The `prune()` method is then called on this Worker object with an instance of `TmpCfg` where `self.worker_disconnect_delay = 10`
3. Inside the `prune()` method, the condition `if self.last_active + config.worker_disconnect_delay < time.time():` is evaluated
4. Since `self.last_active` is initialized as `None`, adding an integer value `config.worker_disconnect_delay` raises a `TypeError`

### Strategy to Fix the Bug
To fix this bug, we need to handle the case where `last_active` is `None` in a way that prevents the `TypeError` when trying to add an integer value to it. One way to handle this is by checking if `last_active` is `None` before performing any arithmetic operations on it.

### Corrected Version of the Buggy Function
```python
def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
    self.id = worker_id
    self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
    self.last_active = last_active if last_active is not None else time.time()  # seconds since epoch
    self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
    self.tasks = set()  # task objects
    self.info = {}
```

By checking if `last_active` is `None` before using it in calculations, we ensure that the code does not encounter the TypeError seen in the failing test.
