### Bug Explanation:
The bug occurs because the parameter `last_active` is set to `None` by default in the `__init__` function. When trying to calculate `self.last_active + config.worker_disconnect_delay` in the `prune` method, there is an unsupported operation between a `NoneType` and an `int` value, resulting in the `TypeError`.

### Bug Fix:
To fix this bug, we need to ensure that if `last_active` is not provided during initialization, it defaults to 0 instead of `None`. This way, the addition operation in the `prune` method will work correctly.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=0):
    self.id = worker_id
    self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
    self.last_active = last_active if last_active is not None else 0  # seconds since epoch
    self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
    self.tasks = set()  # task objects
    self.info = {}
```
