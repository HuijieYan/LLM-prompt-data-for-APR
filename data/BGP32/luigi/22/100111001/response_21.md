### Bug Explanation
The bug in the `__init__` function arises from the default value of `last_active` being set to `None`. This causes an issue when trying to perform arithmetic operations (addition in this case) with an integer value (`config.worker_disconnect_delay`) in the `prune` method.

### Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to handle the case where `last_active` is `None` in a way that allows for comparison with an integer value. One common approach is to assign a default value to `last_active` if it is `None`, such as setting it to 0.

### Corrected Version of the Function
```python
def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
    self.id = worker_id
    self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
    self.last_active = last_active if last_active is not None else 0  # seconds since epoch, defaulting to 0 if None
    self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
    self.tasks = set()  # task objects
    self.info = {}
```

By ensuring that `last_active` is not `None` when performing arithmetic operations, we prevent the TypeError that was occurring in the failing test.
