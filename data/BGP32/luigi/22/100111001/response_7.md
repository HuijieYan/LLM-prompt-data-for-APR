The issue in the buggy function arises from the `self.last_active` variable being set to `None` initially, causing a `TypeError` when trying to perform addition with an integer value in the `prune` method.

To fix this bug, we need to ensure that `self.last_active` is always initialized with a valid integer value to avoid the `NoneType` error during the operation in the `prune` method.

Here is the corrected version of the buggy function:
```python
def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=0):
    self.id = worker_id
    self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
    self.last_active = last_active if last_active is not None else 0  # seconds since epoch
    self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
    self.tasks = set()  # task objects
    self.info = {}
```

By providing a default value of `0` for the `last_active` parameter and checking if it is `None` when initializing the variable, we prevent the `TypeError` from occurring in the `prune` method.

This corrected version should now pass the failing test.
