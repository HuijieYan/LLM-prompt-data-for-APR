### Analysis:
1. The `__init__` function of the `Worker` class initializes the worker with an `id`, `last_active`, `started` time, `tasks` set, and `info` dictionary.
2. The failing test `test_worker_prune_after_init` creates a `Worker` instance and attempts to call the `prune` method on it, passing a `config` object with a `worker_disconnect_delay` attribute.
3. The error occurs because the `last_active` attribute of the `Worker` instance is initialized as `None`, and when the `prune` method tries to compare `self.last_active + config.worker_disconnect_delay` with `time.time()`, it results in a `TypeError` due to the unsupported operand types for `NoneType` and `int`.
4. To fix this bug, we need to handle the case where `last_active` is `None` and provide a default value or check before performing the sum operation.

### Bug Fix:
```python
def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
    self.id = worker_id
    self.reference = None
    self.last_active = last_active if last_active is not None else time.time()
    self.started = time.time()
    self.tasks = set()
    self.info = {}
```

With this fix, the `last_active` attribute will default to the current time if no value is provided during initialization, preventing the `TypeError` encountered in the failing test.
