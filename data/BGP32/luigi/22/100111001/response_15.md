The bug in the provided function is due to the `last_active` parameter being set to `None` by default. This leads to a `TypeError` when trying to perform arithmetic operations on `None` and an integer.

To fix this bug, we need to handle the case where `last_active` is `None` and provide a default value for it to avoid the `TypeError`.

### Corrected Version of the Function
```python
def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
    self.id = worker_id
    self.reference = None
    self.last_active = last_active if last_active is not None else time.time()
    self.started = time.time()
    self.tasks = set()
    self.info = {}
```

By providing a default value for `last_active` in the constructor, the corrected function ensures that if `last_active` is not explicitly provided, it will default to the current time using `time.time()` to avoid any `TypeError` when performing arithmetic operations in the code.

This corrected version of the function should now pass the failing test.
