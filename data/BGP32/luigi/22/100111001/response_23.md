### Analysis
The error occurs in the `prune` method of the `Worker` class due to the `last_active` attribute being initialized as `None` in the `__init__` method. This causes a `TypeError` when trying to perform arithmetic operations with `None`.

### Bug Cause
The `last_active` attribute is initialized as `None` in the `__init__` method of the `Worker` class. When the `prune` method tries to add `config.worker_disconnect_delay` (an integer) to `self.last_active`, which is `None`, it raises a `TypeError`.

### Fix Strategy
Initialize `last_active` with `time.time()` instead of `None` in the `__init__` method to ensure it starts with a valid numeric value.

### Corrected Version
```python
def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
    self.id = worker_id
    self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
    self.last_active = last_active if last_active is not None else time.time()  # seconds since epoch if None provided
    self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
    self.tasks = set()  # task objects
    self.info = {}

```

After making this change, the `last_active` attribute will be initialized to the current time if no value is provided, ensuring that arithmetic operations can be performed without encountering a `TypeError`. This corrected version should pass the failing test.
