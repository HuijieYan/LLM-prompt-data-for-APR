The issue in the buggy function arises from the `self.last_active` variable being assigned a default value of `None` and then used in a comparison operation without handling the case where it might be `None`.

### Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that `self.last_active` is always initialized to a valid value before using it in any comparisons.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
    self.id = worker_id
    self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
    if last_active is not None:
        self.last_active = last_active  # seconds since epoch
    else:
        self.last_active = time.time()  # Initialize to current time if no value provided
    self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
    self.tasks = set()  # task objects
    self.info = {}
```

By initializing `self.last_active` to the current time if a value is not provided, we ensure that it is always a valid timestamp and can be safely used in comparisons.

After applying this fix, the corrected version of the function should pass the failing test.
