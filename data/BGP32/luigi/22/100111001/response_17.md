The bug in the provided function is due to the `last_active` parameter being set to `None` by default and then trying to perform addition with an integer in the `prune` method.

### Cause of the Bug:
- The `last_active` parameter in the `__init__` function is set to `None` by default.
- In the `prune` method, it tries to add `config.worker_disconnect_delay` (an integer) to `self.last_active` (which is `None`) causing a `TypeError`.

### Fixing the Bug:
- To fix the bug, we need to handle the scenario where `last_active` is `None` appropriately in the `prune` method.

### Corrected Version:
```python
# The corrected version of the buggy function
def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
    self.id = worker_id
    self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
    self.last_active = last_active  # seconds since epoch
    self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
    self.tasks = set()  # task objects
    self.info = {}

def prune(self, config):
    if self.last_active is not None and self.last_active + config.worker_disconnect_delay < time.time():
        # Delete workers that haven't said anything for a while (probably killed)
        pass
```

By checking if `self.last_active` is not `None` before performing the addition in the `prune` method, we can prevent the `TypeError` that was occurring.
