### Analysis
The error occurs because the `last_active` parameter in the `__init__` function can be `None`, but it is used in a comparison without checking for `None` first, leading to a `TypeError`.

### Bug Cause
The `last_active` parameter is left as `None` in the `__init__` function. When `prune` is called, it attempts to compare `self.last_active` (which is `None`) with an integer, causing the `TypeError`.

### Fix
To fix the bug, we need to check if `self.last_active` is `None` before performing any operations on it.
```python
def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
    self.id = worker_id
    self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
    self.last_active = last_active  # seconds since epoch
    self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
    self.tasks = set()  # task objects
    self.info = {}

def prune(self, config):
    if self.last_active is not None and self.last_active + config.worker_disconnect_delay < time.time():
        # Perform the pruning operation
        pass
```

By checking if `self.last_active` is not `None` before the comparison, we avoid the `TypeError` and the function should work correctly now.
