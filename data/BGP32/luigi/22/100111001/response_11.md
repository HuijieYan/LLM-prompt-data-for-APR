### Analysis
The error message indicates a `TypeError` when trying to add `NoneType` and `int`, specifically in the line `if self.last_active + config.worker_disconnect_delay < time.time():` inside the `prune` method. The issue arises because `last_active` is allowed to be `None`, causing the addition to fail.

### Bug Cause
The bug occurs because the `last_active` parameter in the `__init__` method of the `Worker` class is set to `None` by default, resulting in a `NoneType` when referenced in the `prune` method later on. 

### Strategy for Fixing
To fix this bug, we need to ensure that `last_active` is always initialized correctly to a numeric value, preferably the current time in seconds since the epoch if no value is provided during initialization. This will prevent the `NoneType` error when trying to calculate the worker's last active time during pruning. 

### Corrected Version
```python
import time

def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
    self.id = worker_id
    self.reference = None
    if last_active is not None:
        self.last_active = last_active
    else:
        self.last_active = time.time()
    self.started = time.time()
    self.tasks = set()
    self.info = {}
``` 

In this corrected version, we check if `last_active` is `None` and set it to the current time using `time.time()` if that's the case. This ensures that `last_active` always holds a numeric value, preventing the `TypeError` during calculations in the `prune` method.
