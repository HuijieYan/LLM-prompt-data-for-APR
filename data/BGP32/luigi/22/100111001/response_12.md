### Analysis
The error message indicates a `TypeError: unsupported operand type(s) for +: 'NoneType' and 'int'`. This implies that `self.last_active` is `None` when trying to add it to an integer (`config.worker_disconnect_delay`). The `last_active` parameter can be passed as `None` in the `__init__` function leading to this issue.

### Bug
The bug is in the `__init__` function of the `Worker` class where `last_active` is initialized as `None`. Later in the `prune` method, when trying to compare `self.last_active` (which is `None`) with an integer value, it causes the `TypeError`.

### Fix
Initialize `last_active` to `0` if no value is provided for `last_active` in the `__init__` function. This way, it will always be an integer and prevent the `TypeError` during comparisons.

### Corrected Version
```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: luigi/scheduler.py

def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
    self.id = worker_id
    self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
    self.last_active = last_active if last_active is not None else 0  # seconds since epoch, initialized to 0 if None
    self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
    self.tasks = set()  # task objects
    self.info = {}
```
