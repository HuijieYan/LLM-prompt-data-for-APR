### Bug Analysis
The bug occurs in the `prune` method where the comparison `self.last_active + config.worker_disconnect_delay < time.time()` is made. The error message indicates that the addition operation is being performed between a `NoneType` (self.last_active) and an integer (config.worker_disconnect_delay).

### Bug Cause
The `last_active` parameter in the `__init__` method of the `Worker` class is set as `None` by default. This causes the value of `self.last_active` to be `None` during initialization. When trying to compare `None + config.worker_disconnect_delay` in the `prune` method, it causes a `TypeError` as `None` cannot be added to an integer.

### Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that `self.last_active` is initialized with an integer value instead of `None` during class initialization.

### Corrected Version of the Buggy Function
```python
def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=0):
    self.id = worker_id
    self.reference = None
    self.last_active = last_active
    self.started = time.time()
    self.tasks = set()
    self.info = {}
```

With this fix, the `last_active` parameter defaults to `0` if not provided during initialization, ensuring that it's an integer and preventing the `TypeError` when performing arithmetic operations.
