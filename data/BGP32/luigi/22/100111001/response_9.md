### Bug Explanation
The error occurs because the `last_active` parameter in the `__init__` function is initialized as `None`, and then when the `prune` method is called, it attempts to add an integer value to `None`, resulting in a `TypeError`. This error happens because `None` is not compatible with the addition operation.

### Fixing the Bug
To fix this issue, you should ensure that `last_active` is set to the current time in `__init__` if no value is specified. This way, it will always be an integer timestamp and avoid the `TypeError` during the `prune` method.

### Corrected Version
```python
def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
    self.id = worker_id
    self.reference = None
    self.last_active = last_active if last_active is not None else time.time()
    self.started = time.time()
    self.tasks = set()
    self.info = {}
```
