### Bug Analysis
The error message indicates a `TypeError` in the `prune` method of the `Worker` class within the `luigi/scheduler.py` file. The issue arises from the line:
```python
if self.last_active + config.worker_disconnect_delay < time.time():
```
The error is caused by trying to add `NoneType` (self.last_active is initialized as `None` by default) to an integer (`config.worker_disconnect_delay`).

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix this bug, we need to handle the case where `self.last_active` is `None` by default. We can check if `self.last_active` is `None` and skip the comparison then, as it doesn't make sense to add `None` to an integer. 

### Corrected Version

```python
def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
    self.id = worker_id
    self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
    self.last_active = last_active  # seconds since epoch
    self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
    self.tasks = set()  # task objects
    self.info = {}

def prune(self, config):
    if self.last_active is not None and self.last_active + config.worker_disconnect_delay < time.time():
        # prune logic here
        pass
``` 

By adding the `is not None` check before performing the comparison with `config.worker_disconnect_delay`, we ensure that the addition operation only occurs if `self.last_active` is not `None`. This correction will prevent the `TypeError` when running the failing test.
