The issue in the provided code is that the `last_active` parameter in the `__init__` function can be `None`, but in the `prune` method, it is assumed to be a numerical value when comparing it with `time.time()`. This causes a `TypeError` when trying to add a `NoneType` with an integer.

We can fix this issue by checking if `self.last_active` is not `None` before performing the comparison in the `prune` method.

Here is the corrected version of the `__init__` and `prune` methods:
```python
def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
    self.id = worker_id
    self.reference = None
    self.last_active = last_active
    self.started = time.time()
    self.tasks = set()
    self.info = {}

def prune(self, config):
    if self.last_active is not None and self.last_active + config.worker_disconnect_delay < time.time():
        # Perform pruning actions here
        pass
```

This modification ensures that the comparison in the `prune` method is only done when `self.last_active` is not `None`. This should resolve the `TypeError` issue encountered in the failing test case provided.
