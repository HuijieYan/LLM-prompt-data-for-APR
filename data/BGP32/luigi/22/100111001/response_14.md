### Error Analysis
The error occurs in the `prune` method of the `Worker` class. The problem lies in comparing `self.last_active` (which can be `None`) with an integer in the line `if self.last_active + config.worker_disconnect_delay < time.time():`. This comparison raises a `TypeError` due to the unsupported operand types.

### Bug Cause
The bug is caused by the `self.last_active` attribute being set to `None` by default in the `__init__` function, and the comparison operation in `prune` method is trying to add an integer to `None`, leading to a `TypeError`.

### Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that `self.last_active` is properly initialized in the `__init__` method. One approach would be to set a default value of `0` for `self.last_active` if no value is provided during object initialization.

### Corrected Version
```python
def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
    self.id = worker_id
    self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
    self.last_active = last_active if last_active is not None else 0  # seconds since epoch. Set default value to 0 if None
    self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
    self.tasks = set()  # task objects
    self.info = {}

def prune(self, config):
    if self.last_active + config.worker_disconnect_delay < time.time():
    # rest of the method implementation
```

By setting a default value of `0` for `self.last_active` if no value is provided during initialization, the comparison operation in the `prune` method will now work correctly without raising a `TypeError`.
