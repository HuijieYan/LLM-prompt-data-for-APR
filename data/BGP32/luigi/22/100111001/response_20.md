### Bug Explanation
The bug occurs because the `last_active` parameter in the `__init__` function of the `Worker` class is nullable (`None` by default), and in the `prune` method, there is an attempt to perform addition between `None` and an integer value. This operation raises a `TypeError` due to unsupported operand types.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that `last_active` is always initialized properly and is not `None`. One possible strategy is to set a default value for `last_active` if it is not provided during instantiation.

### Corrected Version of the Function
```python
def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
    self.id = worker_id
    self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
    self.last_active = last_active if last_active is not None else time.time()
    self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
    self.tasks = set()  # task objects
    self.info = {}
```

By modifying the `__init__` function to check if `last_active` is `None` and set it to the current time if that's the case, we ensure that there are no `None` values in the calculation done in the `prune` method, fixing the initial bug.
