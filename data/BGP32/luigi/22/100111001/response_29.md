The bug in the provided function is due to the initialization of `self.last_active` with a default value of `None`, which leads to a `TypeError` when trying to perform addition with an integer value in the `prune` method.

### Bug Explanation:
1. The `__init__` method of the `Worker` class initializes `self.last_active` as `None`.
2. In the `prune` method, it tries to add `config.worker_disconnect_delay` which is an integer to `self.last_active`, which is `None`, resulting in a `TypeError`.

### Fix Strategy:
Initialize `self.last_active` with the current time (converted to seconds since epoch) if no value is provided during object creation.

### Corrected Version:
```python
import time

class Worker:
    def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
        self.id = worker_id
        self.reference = None
        self.last_active = last_active if last_active is not None else time.time()  # Initialize with current time if last_active not provided
        self.started = time.time()
        self.tasks = set()
        self.info = {}

    def prune(self, config):
        if self.last_active + config.worker_disconnect_delay < time.time():
            # Implement the pruning logic here
            pass
```

By initializing `self.last_active` with the current time if no value is provided during object creation, we ensure that it is always an integer value and prevent the `TypeError` when performing addition in the `prune` method.
