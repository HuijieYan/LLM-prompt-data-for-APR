### Bug Analysis
The bug occurs in the `prune` method when trying to calculate the time difference between `self.last_active` (which could be `None`) and the current time using the `+` operator, resulting in a `TypeError`. The issue stems from `self.last_active` being potentially `None`, making it incompatible with the integer operand in the addition operation.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to handle the case where `self.last_active` is `None` gracefully. We can set a default value for `last_active` in the constructor, ensuring that it is always an integer representing the seconds since epoch.

### Corrected Version
```python
def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
    self.id = worker_id
    self.reference = None  
    self.last_active = last_active if last_active is not None else time.time()
    self.started = time.time()  
    self.tasks = set()  
    self.info = {}

def prune(self, config):
    if self.last_active is not None and self.last_active + config.worker_disconnect_delay < time.time():
        # Perform pruning operation
        pass
```

With this corrected version, the `prune` method will now check if `self.last_active` is not `None` before performing the time comparison, preventing the `TypeError` that occurred with the buggy implementation.
