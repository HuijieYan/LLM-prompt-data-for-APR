The issue in the buggy function arises from the fact that the `last_active` parameter is set to `None`, and later in the code, an operation involving addition is attempted between `None` and an integer, resulting in a `TypeError`.

To fix this issue, we need to ensure that when `last_active` is not provided, it defaults to a valid numerical value instead of `None`. One approach is to set it to `0` if no value is specified.

Here is the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
    self.id = worker_id
    self.reference = None  
    self.last_active = last_active if last_active is not None else 0  
    self.started = time.time()  
    self.tasks = set()  
    self.info = {}
```

With this correction, the function will handle cases where `last_active` is not provided, ensuring that the addition operation with an integer works correctly.
