The bug in the provided `__init__` function arises from the fact that `last_active` parameter can be `None`, causing a `TypeError` when trying to add an integer value to it in the `prune` method.

### Bug Explanation:
- The `last_active` parameter can be passed as `None` in the `__init__` function.
- In the `prune` method, the code tries to add an integer value to `self.last_active` without checking if it is `None`, resulting in a `TypeError`.

### Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to handle the case where `last_active` might be `None` in the `__init__` function by providing a default value (e.g., current time). This way, in the `prune` method, we can avoid the `TypeError` by making sure `self.last_active` is not `None` before performing the addition operation.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
    self.id = worker_id
    self.reference = None
    self.last_active = last_active if last_active is not None else time.time()
    self.started = time.time()
    self.tasks = set()
    self.info = {}
```

By making this modification, the `__init__` function will handle cases where `last_active` is `None`, ensuring that the `prune` method can perform operations involving `self.last_active` without encountering a `TypeError`.
