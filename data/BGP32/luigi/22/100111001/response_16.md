### Bug Explanation:
The bug in the `__init__` function of the `Worker` class arises from the fact that `self.last_active` is initialized as `None`, but in the `prune` method, it is used in a comparison operation without handling the case where `self.last_active` is `None`. This leads to a `TypeError` because `None` cannot be used in arithmetic operations.

### Bug Fix:
To fix this bug, we need to handle the case where `self.last_active` is `None` in the `prune` method. One way to fix this is to check if `self.last_active` is not `None` before performing the comparison. If it is `None`, we can assume that the worker has never been active and treat the comparison accordingly.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
    self.id = worker_id
    self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
    self.last_active = last_active  # seconds since epoch
    self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
    self.tasks = set()  # task objects
    self.info = {}

def prune(self, config):
    # Delete workers that haven't said anything for a while (probably killed)
    if self.last_active is None or (self.last_active + config.worker_disconnect_delay) < time.time():
        # Handle the case where last_active is None or comparison can be performed
        # Other logic for pruning...
``` 

By checking if `self.last_active` is `None` before the comparison, we prevent the `TypeError` from occurring in the `prune` method. This corrected version should pass the failing test without any issues.
