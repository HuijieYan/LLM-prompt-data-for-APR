### Bug Explanation
The error message indicates a `TypeError` occurring when trying to perform an addition operation between `NoneType` and `int`. The problematic line is `if self.last_active + config.worker_disconnect_delay < time.time():` in the `prune` method.

Looking at the buggy `__init__` function, it initializes `self.last_active` with a default value of `None`. This causes the `TypeError` when trying to add `None` to an integer in the `prune` method.

### Bug Fix
To fix this bug, we need to ensure that `self.last_active` is properly initialized in the `__init__` method to avoid the `NoneType` issue when calculating the worker's activity time in the `prune` method.

### Corrected Version
```python
def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
    self.id = worker_id
    self.reference = None
    self.last_active = last_active if last_active is not None else time.time()
    self.started = time.time()
    self.tasks = set()
    self.info = {}
```

By updating the `__init__` method to set `self.last_active` to the current time if no specific value is provided, we ensure that the worker's activity time is initialized correctly and the error in the failing test is resolved.
