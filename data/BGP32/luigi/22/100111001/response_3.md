### Analysis
The error message indicates a `TypeError` at line 245 of the `luigi/scheduler.py` file. The issue arises from trying to add an integer to a `NoneType` object (`self.last_active`). The failing test `test_worker_prune_after_init` creates a `Worker` object with `worker_id=123` and then calls the `prune` method with a `TmpCfg` object, which has `worker_disconnect_delay = 10`.

### Bug Cause
The constructor of the `Worker` class initializes the `last_active` attribute with a default value of `None`. Hence, when trying to check if `(self.last_active + config.worker_disconnect_delay < time.time())`, it triggers a `TypeError` due to the addition operation between `NoneType` and `int`.

### Fix Strategy
To fix this issue, we need to handle the case where `last_active` is `None` and convert it to an appropriate value for comparison with `config.worker_disconnect_delay`.

### Corrected Version
```python
def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
    self.id = worker_id
    self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
    self.last_active = last_active if last_active is not None else time.time()  # seconds since epoch or current time
    self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
    self.tasks = set()  # task objects
    self.info = {}
```

After making this change, the `last_active` attribute will default to the current time if no value is provided, preventing the `NoneType` issue during the comparison in the `prune` method.
