### Bug Analysis
The error message `TypeError: unsupported operand type(s) for +: 'NoneType' and 'int'` indicates that the `self.last_active` variable is of type `None`, which cannot be used in the addition operation with an `int` value (`config.worker_disconnect_delay`). This results in a runtime error when trying to compare the variables in the `prune` function.

### Bug Cause
The `self.last_active` variable is initialized with a default value of `None` in the buggy `__init__` function. Therefore, when the `prune` function is called, and the comparison is made, it causes the `TypeError` due to attempting to add `None` with an integer value.

### Fix Strategy
To fix this bug, we need to ensure that `self.last_active` is appropriately initialized to a valid value during object creation so that it can be used in calculations without causing a type error.

### Corrected Version
Below is the corrected version of the `__init__` function that initializes `self.last_active` to the current time if `last_active` is not provided during object creation:
```python
def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
    self.id = worker_id
    self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
    self.last_active = last_active if last_active is not None else time.time()  # seconds since epoch
    self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
    self.tasks = set()  # task objects
    self.info = {}
```

By initializing `self.last_active` with the provided value from `last_active` or the current time if it is `None`, we ensure that it is always a valid timestamp and can be used in calculations without causing type errors.
