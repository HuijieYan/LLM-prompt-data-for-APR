### Bug Explanation
The error message points out that there is a `TypeError` because the `last_active` attribute is initialized as `None`, and when trying to perform addition with an integer in the `prune` method, it causes an error. The issue is that the program does not handle the case where `last_active` is `None` correctly, leading to the `TypeError`.

### Bug Fix
To fix the bug, we need to check if `last_active` is `None` before attempting to perform any operations with it. We can set a default value if `last_active` is not provided during initialization.

### Corrected Version
```python
def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
    self.id = worker_id
    self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
    self.last_active = last_active if last_active is not None else time.time()  # seconds since epoch
    self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
    self.tasks = set()  # task objects
    self.info = {}

def prune(self, config):
    # Delete workers that haven't said anything for a while (probably killed)
    if self.last_active is not None and self.last_active + config.worker_disconnect_delay < time.time():
        # perform pruning operations here
``` 

This revised version checks if `last_active` is `None` before adding it to `config.worker_disconnect_delay`. If it's `None`, it assigns the current time instead. This modification ensures that the code can handle the case when `last_active` is not provided during initialization.
