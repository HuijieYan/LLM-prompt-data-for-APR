To fix the bug in the provided function, we need to modify the `__init__` method to properly initialize the class attributes. The issue lies in the incorrect default value assignment for the `last_active` parameter.

The bug occurs because the `last_active` parameter is set to `None` by default, which is not the correct type for this variable. It should be set to the provided value if it is given, else it should default to `None`.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
# The corrected version of the function
def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
    self.id = worker_id
    self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
    self.last_active = last_active if last_active is not None else None  # seconds since epoch
    self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
    self.tasks = set()  # task objects
    self.info = {}
```

With this correction, the function will properly handle the `last_active` parameter and set it to the provided value if given, or default to `None` if not provided. It ensures that the expected values and types of variables after the function's execution match the specified test cases.
