The bug in the provided function is that the `worker_id` parameter is not assigned correctly to `self.id`. The `worker_id` parameter should be assigned to `self.id` instead of `worker_id`.

To fix this bug, we need to update the assignment of the `worker_id` parameter to `self.id` in the `__init__` function.

Here is the corrected version of the function:
```python
def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
    self.id = worker_id
    self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
    self.last_active = last_active  # seconds since epoch
    self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
    self.tasks = set()  # task objects
    self.info = {}
```

After applying this fix, the function will correctly assign the `worker_id` parameter to `self.id` as expected.
