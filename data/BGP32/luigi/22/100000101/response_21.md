To fix the bug in the provided function, we need to address the incorrect initialization of the `self.started` variable. It is currently set to `time.time()` at the time of the object creation, which may not match the value of `last_active` provided in some cases.

To fix this, we will update the `self.started` assignment to use `last_active` when it is provided, and if not, default to the current time using `time.time()`.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
    self.id = worker_id
    self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
    self.last_active = last_active  # seconds since epoch
    self.started = last_active if last_active is not None else time.time()  # seconds since epoch
    self.tasks = set()  # task objects
    self.info = {}
```

With this correction, the `self.started` variable will be initialized correctly based on the provided `last_active` value or the current time. This will ensure that the expected values and types of variables match the specified test cases.
