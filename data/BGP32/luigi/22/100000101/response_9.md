The bug in the provided function is that the `__init__` function does not have the `self` parameter in its definition, which results in an error when trying to access attributes of the instance. To fix this bug, we need to add the `self` parameter to the `__init__` function definition.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
import time

class Worker:
    def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
        self.id = worker_id
        self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
        self.last_active = last_active  # seconds since epoch
        self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        self.tasks = set()  # task objects
        self.info = {}
```

Now the `__init__` function has the `self` parameter included in its definition, allowing it to properly set the attributes of the instance. This corrected version should satisfy the expected input/output values provided.
