The bug in the provided function is that the `__init__` method does not properly initialize the instance variables `self.id` and `self.last_active` according to the input values passed to the function.

The bug occurs because the `worker_id` and `last_active` parameters are not assigned to the instance variables `self.id` and `self.last_active` respectively.

To fix this bug, we need to assign the `worker_id` and `last_active` parameters to the `self.id` and `self.last_active` instance variables within the `__init__` method.

Here is the corrected version of the __init__ method:

```python
def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
    self.id = worker_id
    self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
    self.last_active = last_active  # seconds since epoch
    self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
    self.tasks = set()  # task objects
    self.info = {}
```

With this correction, the function will now properly initialize the instance variables `self.id` and `self.last_active` according to the input values passed to the function.
