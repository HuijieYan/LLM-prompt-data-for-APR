The bug in the provided function is that the `__init__` method is not within a class, which is causing the `self` references to fail. To fix this, the function should be enclosed within a class definition.

Below is the corrected version of the function:

```python
import time

class Scheduler:
    def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
        self.id = worker_id
        self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
        self.last_active = last_active  # seconds since epoch
        self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        self.tasks = set()  # task objects
        self.info = {}

# Expected values and types are the same as mentioned in the case. 
```

With this correction, the function will now properly initialize the variables within the context of a class and satisfy the expected input/output values.
