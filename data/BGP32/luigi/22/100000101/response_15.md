The bug in the provided function is that the `__init__` method is missing the `self` parameter at the beginning, leading to a `TypeError` when this method is called with the provided parameters.

To fix this bug, we need to add the `self` parameter to the `__init__` method.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: luigi/scheduler.py

class Scheduler:
    def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
        self.id = worker_id
        self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
        self.last_active = last_active  # seconds since epoch
        self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        self.tasks = set()  # task objects
        self.info = {}
```

This correction addresses the bug by adding the `self` parameter to the `__init__` method, allowing the function to initialize the instance variables correctly.
