The bug in the provided function is that the `__init__` method definition does not have the class parameter `self`. This is causing an error when trying to access instance variables.

To fix this issue, we need to include the `self` parameter in the `__init__` method definition.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: luigi/scheduler.py

# corrected version of the function
def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
    self.id = worker_id
    self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
    self.last_active = last_active  # seconds since epoch
    self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
    self.tasks = set()  # task objects
    self.info = {}
```

With this correction, the function should now correctly initialize the instance variables `id`, `last_active`, `started`, `tasks`, and `info` with the expected values and types for the given test case.
