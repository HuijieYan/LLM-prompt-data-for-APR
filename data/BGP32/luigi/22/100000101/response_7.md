The bug in the provided function is due to the incorrect initialization of the 'last_active' attribute. The given last_active parameter should be assigned to the self.last_active attribute directly, instead of assigning it to self.last_active as a default value.

To fix the bug, simply assign the 'last_active' parameter to the 'self.last_active' attribute directly in the __init__ function.

Here is the corrected version of the function:
```python
def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
    self.id = worker_id
    self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
    self.last_active = last_active  # seconds since epoch
    self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
    self.tasks = set()  # task objects
    self.info = {}
```
