The bug in the provided function is that the `__init__` method is not part of a class, which is causing the `self` parameter to be undefined. To fix this bug, we need to define a class and then create the `__init__` method within that class.

Here is the corrected version of the function:
```python
# The corrected version of the function
class Scheduler:
    def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
        self.id = worker_id
        self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
        self.last_active = last_active  # seconds since epoch
        self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        self.tasks = set()  # task objects
        self.info = {}

# Expected values remain the same as specified in the test cases
```

By defining a class `Scheduler` and placing the `__init__` method within this class, we can now create an instance of the `Scheduler` class with the desired attributes and values set according to the test cases.
