The bug in the provided function is that it is missing the `self` parameter in the function definition. As a result, when trying to assign values to the instance variables, it is actually trying to assign values to local variables instead.

To fix the bug, we need to include the `self` parameter in the function definition.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
    self.id = worker_id
    self.reference = None
    self.last_active = last_active
    self.started = time.time()
    self.tasks = set()
    self.info = {}
```

This correction ensures that the values are correctly assigned to the instance variables of the class when the function is called.
