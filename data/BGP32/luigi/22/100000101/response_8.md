The bug in the provided function is due to the incorrect initialization of the `last_active` and `started` variables. The `last_active` variable is being wrongly assigned to the `last_active` parameter, while it should be assigned to `last_active` if it is not None, otherwise, it should be assigned the current time. Similarly, the `started` variable should be assigned the current time correctly.

To fix the bug and satisfy the expected input/output values, the corrected version of the function is as follows:

```python
def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
    self.id = worker_id
    self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
    self.last_active = last_active if last_active is not None else time.time()  # seconds since epoch
    self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
    self.tasks = set()  # task objects
    self.info = {}
```

With this correction, the function correctly assigns the `last_active` variable based on the provided input or the current time if no input is given. The `started` variable is also correctly initialized with the current time. This ensures that the expected input/output values are met in all cases.
