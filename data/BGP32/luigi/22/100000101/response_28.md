The bug in the given function is that the `last_active` parameter is not being set correctly due to incorrect parameter naming. Instead of using the `last_active` parameter to initialize `self.last_active`, a different variable `last_active` is being used.

To fix this bug, we need to rename the `last_active` parameter to `last_active` within the function.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
    self.id = worker_id
    self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
    self.last_active = last_active  # seconds since epoch
    self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
    self.tasks = set()  # task objects
    self.info = {}
```

With this correction, the function will now correctly initialize the `self.last_active` variable with the provided `last_active` parameter value.
