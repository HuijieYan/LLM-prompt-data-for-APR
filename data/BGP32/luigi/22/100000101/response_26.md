The bug in the provided function is the incorrect use of the `__init__` constructor method. The `__init__` method should be defined within a class, but in the given code snippet it is defined as a standalone function. 

To fix this bug, we need to create a class that includes the `__init__` method with the correct parameter signatures and assign values to the class instance variables within the `__init__` method.

Here is the corrected version of the code:
```python
import time

class Worker:
    def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
        self.id = worker_id
        self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
        self.last_active = last_active  # seconds since epoch
        self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        self.tasks = set()  # task objects
        self.info = {}

# Expected values and types of variables right before the buggy function's return
worker = Worker(123, 1709218610.8782065)
print(worker.id)  # Expected output: 123
print(worker.last_active)  # Expected output: 1709218610.8782065
print(worker.started)  # Expected output: close to`1709218610.884734` - depends on the time when the object is created
print(worker.tasks)  # Expected output: set()
print(worker.info)  # Expected output: {}

```

By defining the `__init__` method within a class named `Worker`, we can create an instance of the class with the correct initialization values. This corrected version ensures that the expected values and types of variables are satisfied.
