The issue with the buggy function is that it lacks the necessary `self` parameter in the `__init__` method. It should be defined as a class method in order to correctly initialize the instance variables.

To fix this bug, you need to add the `self` parameter to the `__init__` method so that it becomes a class method.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: luigi/scheduler.py

# the corrected function
def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
    self.id = worker_id
    self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
    self.last_active = last_active  # seconds since epoch
    self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
    self.tasks = set()  # task objects
    self.info = {}
```

Make sure to include the necessary class definition and import statements in your code.
