There is a bug in the given buggy function in the initialization section. The issue is with the incorrect assignment of the `last_active` parameter to the `last_active` class attribute. The correct assignment should be `self.last_active = last_active` instead of `self.last_active = None`. 

The strategy to fix the bug is to update the assignment of the `last_active` parameter to the `last_active` class attribute to ensure that it captures the value passed during object instantiation.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
    self.id = worker_id
    self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
    self.last_active = last_active if last_active is not None else time.time()  # seconds since epoch
    self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
    self.tasks = set()  # task objects
    self.info = {}
```

This corrected version of the function ensures that the `last_active` attribute takes the value passed as the argument during initialization or the current time if no value is provided. This will resolve the bug and meet the expected input/output values for the function.
