The bug in the provided function is that the `__init__` method is missing from a class definition. To fix this bug, we need to define a class and place the `__init__` method within it.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
import time

class Worker:
    def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
        self.id = worker_id
        self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world (Currently a dict containing just the host)
        self.last_active = last_active  # seconds since epoch
        self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        self.tasks = set()  # task objects
        self.info = {}

# Expected test case 1
worker_id = 123
last_active = 1709218610.8782065

worker = Worker(worker_id, last_active)

print(worker.id)  # Expected output: 123
print(worker.last_active)  # Expected output: 1709218610.8782065
print(worker.started)  # Expected output: Close to current timestamp at the time of execution
print(worker.tasks)  # Expected output: set()
print(worker.info)  # Expected output: {}

```

This corrected version defines a `Worker` class with the `__init__` method inside it. It creates an instance of the `Worker` class with the provided `worker_id` and `last_active` values. The expected values and types of variables have been adjusted to match the corrected function.
