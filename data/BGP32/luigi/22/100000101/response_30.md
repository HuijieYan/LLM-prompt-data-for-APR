To fix the bug in the given function, we need to address the issue where the `self.last_active` is not being initialized correctly with the provided value. The function is currently setting it to `None` instead of the provided `last_active` value.

We can fix this bug by updating the initialization of `self.last_active` in the `__init__` method to take the provided `last_active` value if it is not `None`.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
    self.id = worker_id
    self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
    self.last_active = last_active if last_active is not None else time.time()  # seconds since epoch
    self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
    self.tasks = set()  # task objects
    self.info = {}
```

With this correction, the function will now properly initialize `self.last_active` with the provided value if it is not `None`.

This corrected version of the function should satisfy the expected input/output values provided in the test cases.
