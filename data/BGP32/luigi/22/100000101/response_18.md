The bug in the provided function is that the `__init__` method is defined incorrectly. The first parameter should be `self` to indicate that it is an instance method of a class. 

To fix this bug, we need to change the function definition to correctly include `self` as the first parameter.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
    self.id = worker_id
    self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
    self.last_active = last_active  # seconds since epoch
    self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
    self.tasks = set()  # task objects
    self.info = {}
```

This corrected version correctly defines the `__init__` method with `self` as the first parameter, which is necessary for instance methods in Python.
