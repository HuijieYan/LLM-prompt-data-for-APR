The bug in the provided function is that the `__init__` method is not properly defined within a class. It seems like it is a part of a class named `scheduler`, but the class definition is missing in the provided code snippet. To fix this bug, we need to properly define the class `scheduler` and have the `__init__` method inside it.

Here is the corrected version:

```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: luigi/scheduler.py

import time

class scheduler:
    def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
        self.id = worker_id
        self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
        self.last_active = last_active  # seconds since epoch
        self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        self.tasks = set()  # task objects
        self.info = {}
```

By defining the `scheduler` class and placing the `__init__` method within it, the function will now work as expected and create an instance of `scheduler` with the specified parameters. The expected input/output values mentioned in the test cases will be met with this corrected version.
