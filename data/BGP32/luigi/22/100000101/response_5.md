The bug in the provided function is that it is missing the `self` parameter in the `__init__` method, which is necessary for instance variables to be initialized properly. This is causing the variables to not be assigned to the correct instance of the class.

To fix this bug, we should add the `self` parameter to the `__init__` method so that the instance variables are correctly initialized.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
    self.id = worker_id
    self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
    self.last_active = last_active  # seconds since epoch
    self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
    self.tasks = set()  # task objects
    self.info = {}
```

This corrected version ensures that the instance variables are properly initialized and that the expected input/output values are satisfied for the given test cases.
