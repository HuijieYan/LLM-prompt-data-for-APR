## Fixing the bug

### Bug explanation
The bug in the provided function is that the `__init__` method is not part of a class definition, which is necessary in Python. The `self` parameter refers to the instance of the class, so it needs to be inside a class definition in order to correctly initialize the instance variables.

### Solution strategy
To fix the bug, we need to define a class containing the `__init__` method with the correct parameters. The class should encapsulate the functionality of the worker object. By doing this, we ensure that the `__init__` method properly initializes the instance variables for each worker object. 

### Corrected version of the function

```python
import time

class Worker:
    def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
        self.id = worker_id
        self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
        self.last_active = last_active  # seconds since epoch
        self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        self.tasks = set()  # task objects
        self.info = {}

# Testing the corrected function for the expected case
worker_id = 123
last_active = 1709218610.8782065

worker = Worker(worker_id, last_active)

print(worker.id)               # Expected output: 123
print(worker.last_active)      # Expected output: 1709218610.8782065
print(worker.started)          # Output will vary slightly due to current time
print(worker.tasks)            # Expected output: set()
print(worker.info)             # Expected output: {}
```

By encapsulating the worker object functionality within a class, we ensure that the `__init__` method initializes the instance variables correctly, meeting the expected values and types for each case.
