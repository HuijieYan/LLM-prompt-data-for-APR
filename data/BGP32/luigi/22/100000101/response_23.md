The bug in the provided function is that the `last_active` parameter is not correctly assigned. The function is assigning the `last_active` parameter to `self.last_active`, but it should be assigned to `last_active` directly as it is passed as an argument.

To fix this bug, we need to assign the `last_active` parameter to `self.last_active` directly.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
import time

def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
    self.id = worker_id
    self.reference = None
    self.last_active = last_active  # Assigning the parameter directly
    self.started = time.time()
    self.tasks = set()
    self.info = {}
``` 

This corrected version fixes the bug where the `last_active` parameter is now correctly assigned to `self.last_active`.
