To fix the bug in the provided function, we need to correctly initialize the `__init__` method in the class. The issue in the buggy function is that the `__init__` method is defined incorrectly by missing the `self` parameter in the function signature. This results in an error because when an instance of the class is created, the instance itself (self) is not passed to the function.

Thus, the suggested strategy for fixing the bug is to include the `self` parameter in the `__init__` method to ensure correct instantiation of the class.

Here is the corrected version of the function with the `self` parameter included in the function signature:

```python
class Scheduler:
    def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
        self.id = worker_id
        self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
        self.last_active = last_active  # seconds since epoch
        self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        self.tasks = set()  # task objects
        self.info = {}
```

By adding the `self` parameter in the function signature, the function will correctly initialize the instance attributes based on the input values provided during the class instantiation. This corrected version should now satisfy the expected input/output values for the provided test case.
