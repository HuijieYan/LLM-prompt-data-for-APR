The bug in the provided function is that the `__init__` method is defined incorrectly. The function lacks the `self` parameter, which is essential for instance methods in Python classes. To fix this bug, we need to add the `self` parameter to the function definition.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
# The corrected version of the function
def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
    self.id = worker_id
    self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
    self.last_active = last_active  # seconds since epoch
    self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
    self.tasks = set()  # task objects
    self.info = {}
```

With this correction, the function now correctly initializes the instance attributes `self.id`, `self.reference`, `self.last_active`, `self.started`, `self.tasks`, and `self.info` with the provided values and types in the expected case.
