The bug in the provided function is that the `self.started` variable is being set to the current time using `time.time()` instead of initializing it with the provided `last_active` parameter.

### Bug:
The `self.started` variable is being set incorrectly using `time.time()` instead of using the provided `last_active` parameter. This results in `self.started` not reflecting the correct starting time for the worker.

### Fix:
Initialize the `self.started` variable with the `last_active` parameter if it is provided, otherwise use the current time using `time.time()`.

### Corrected code:
```python
def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
    self.id = worker_id
    self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
    self.last_active = last_active  # seconds since epoch
    self.started = last_active if last_active is not None else time.time()  # seconds since epoch
    self.tasks = set()  # task objects
    self.info = {}
```
