## Fixing the bug

### Bug explanation:
The bug occurs in the `__init__` method of the class. The issue lies in the initialization of the `started` variable. Currently, it is initialized using `time.time()`, which will give the current time in seconds since epoch. This can lead to a different value being set for `started` compared to the value of `last_active`, even though they should ideally be close to each other given the context of the function. 

### Strategy for fixing the bug:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the `started` variable is set to the value of `last_active` if `last_active` is provided during initialization. This will make sure that the time values for `started` and `last_active` are consistent.

### The corrected version of the function:
```python
def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
    self.id = worker_id
    self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
    self.last_active = last_active  # seconds since epoch
    self.started = last_active if last_active else time.time()  # set started to last_active if provided, else set it to current time
    self.tasks = set()  # task objects
    self.info = {}
```

By making this change, the `started` variable will now be consistent with the provided `last_active` value, ensuring that the time values are aligned as expected.
