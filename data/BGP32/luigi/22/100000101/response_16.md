The bug in the provided function is that the `__init__` method does not belong to any class. The `self` parameter is used in the function, indicating that it should be a method of a class. 

To fix this bug, we need to define a class that contains the `__init__` method and initialize the instance variables properly.

Here is the corrected version of the function:
```python
import time

class Scheduler:
    def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
        self.id = worker_id
        self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
        self.last_active = last_active  # seconds since epoch
        self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        self.tasks = set()  # task objects
        self.info = {}

# Test the corrected function with the expected case
worker_id = 123
last_active = 1709218610.8782065
scheduler = Scheduler(worker_id, last_active)

# Print the values to verify correctness
print(scheduler.id)  # Expected output: 123
print(scheduler.last_active)  # Expected output: 1709218610.8782065
print(scheduler.started)  # Expected output: close to current epoch time
print(scheduler.tasks)  # Expected output: set()
print(scheduler.info)  # Expected output: {}
```
