## Analysis
The buggy function is the `__init__` method of the `Worker` class. The bug seems to be related to the missing `prune` method in the `Worker` class. The failing test is calling the `prune` method on the `Worker` instance, but the `Worker` class does not have the `prune` method implemented.

## Bug Cause
The cause of the bug is that the `Worker` class does not have a `prune` method defined, but the failing test is trying to call this method on a `Worker` instance. This leads to an `AttributeError` because the method does not exist.

## Fix Strategy
To fix this bug, we need to implement the `prune` method in the `Worker` class. The `prune` method should be responsible for cleaning up tasks that are no longer active based on a given configuration. 

## Corrected Version
```python
# The corrected version of the buggy function

class Worker(object):
    """
    Structure for tracking worker activity and keeping their references.
    """

    def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
        self.id = worker_id
        self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
        self.last_active = last_active  # seconds since epoch
        self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        self.tasks = set()  # task objects
        self.info = {}

    def prune(self, config):
        current_time = time.time()
        active_tasks = set()
        for task in self.tasks:
            if current_time - task.last_updated < config.worker_disconnect_delay:
                active_tasks.add(task)
        self.tasks = active_tasks
```

With the `prune` method implemented in the `Worker` class, the corrected version should now pass the failing test.
