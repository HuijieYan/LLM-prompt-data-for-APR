The buggy function `__init__` in the Worker class is setting the `last_active` attribute to the value passed as an argument, but if no value is passed, it defaults to `None`. However, in the failing test case `test_worker_prune_after_init`, the `prune` method is being called on the `Worker` instance which relies on the `last_active` attribute being set to a valid value.

Here's a corrected version of the `__init__` function in the `Worker` class:

```python
# The corrected version of the __init__ function in the Worker class
class Worker(object):
    def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
        self.id = worker_id
        self.reference = None
        self.last_active = last_active if last_active is not None else time.time()  # Set to current time if None
        self.started = time.time()
        self.tasks = set()
        self.info = {}
```

In the corrected version, we check if the `last_active` argument is `None` and set it to the current time using `time.time()` if that is the case. This ensures that the `last_active` attribute always has a valid value even if `None` is passed during initialization.
