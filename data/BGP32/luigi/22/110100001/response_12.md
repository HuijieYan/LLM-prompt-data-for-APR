## Analysis:
1. The buggy function is the `__init__` method within the `Worker` class in the `luigi/scheduler.py` file.
2. The function initializes a `Worker` object with some attributes like worker id, last active time, and other parameters.
3. The failing test `test_worker_prune_after_init` tries to create a worker object and then immediately calls the `prune` method on it, which seems to expect some behavior that is not handled correctly in the `__init__` function.
4. The bug seems to be related to the initialization of the `last_active` field and the `prune` method expecting some operation to be done during initialization.

## Bug Cause:
The bug is caused by the `prune` method being called on a newly initialized `Worker` object which does not set the `last_active` time explicitly. The `prune` method might be trying to use the `last_active` time, but it is not set during initialization causing the error.

## Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to update the `__init__` method of the `Worker` class to handle setting the `last_active` time explicitly during initialization.

## Corrected Version:
```python
class Worker(object):
    """
    Structure for tracking worker activity and keeping their references.
    """

    def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
        self.id = worker_id
        self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
        self.last_active = last_active if last_active is not None else time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        self.tasks = set()  # task objects
        self.info = {}
```

By explicitly checking if `last_active` is provided during initialization and setting it to the current time if not specified, the bug should be fixed. This way, when the `prune` method is called immediately after initialization, the `last_active` time will be correctly set.
