### Analysis:
1. The buggy function is the `__init__` method of the `Worker` class in the file `luigi/scheduler.py`.
2. The potential error location is the incorrect initialization of the `last_active` attribute in the `__init__` method.
3. The bug arises from providing a mutable default argument `last_active=None` in the `__init__` method which can retain its state across multiple instances of `Worker` objects.
4. To fix the bug, we should initialize the `last_active` attribute in the `__init__` method with the current time stamp if it is not provided.
5. Providing a corrected version below:

### Corrected Version:
```python
class Worker(object):
    """
    Structure for tracking worker activity and keeping their references.
    """

    def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
        self.id = worker_id
        self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
        self.last_active = last_active if last_active is not None else time.time()  # seconds since epoch if not provided
        self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        self.tasks = set()  # task objects
        self.info = {}
```

After applying this fix, the provided failing test `test_worker_prune_after_init` should pass without any errors.
