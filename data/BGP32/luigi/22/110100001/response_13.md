The issue in the buggy function is that the `prune` method is called in the failing test, but the `prune` method itself is not defined in the `Worker` class. This causes an AttributeError when the failing test tries to call `worker.prune(TmpCfg())`.

To fix this issue, we need to define the `prune` method in the `Worker` class. The `prune` method should remove any inactive workers based on a worker disconnect delay threshold.

Here is the corrected version of the `Worker` class with the `prune` method implemented:

```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: luigi/scheduler.py

class Worker(object):
    """
    Structure for tracking worker activity and keeping their references.
    """

    def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
        self.id = worker_id
        self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
        self.last_active = last_active  # seconds since epoch
        self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        self.tasks = set()  # task objects
        self.info = {}

    def prune(self, cfg):
        current_time = time.time()
        if self.last_active is not None and current_time - self.last_active > cfg.worker_disconnect_delay:
            # Remove the inactive worker
            self.reference = None
            self.last_active = None
```

Now, the corrected `Worker` class includes the `prune` method that removes any inactive workers based on the worker disconnect delay provided in the `Config` object.

This corrected version should pass the failing test `test_worker_prune_after_init`.
