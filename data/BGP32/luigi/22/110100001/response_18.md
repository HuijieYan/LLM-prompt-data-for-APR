The issue with the `Worker` class initialization in the provided code is that there is no `prune` method defined in the `Worker` class. The failing test `test_worker_prune_after_init` is trying to call the `prune` method on the `Worker` instance, which does not exist.

To fix the bug, we need to define a `prune` method in the `Worker` class that takes a configuration object as input and performs the necessary pruning operation. 

Here is the corrected version of the `Worker` class with the `prune` method added:

```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: luigi/scheduler.py

class Worker(object):
    """
    Structure for tracking worker activity and keeping their references.
    """

    def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
        self.id = worker_id
        self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
        self.last_active = last_active  # seconds since epoch
        self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        self.tasks = set()  # task objects
        self.info = {}

    def prune(self, config):
        current_time = time.time()

        if self.last_active is not None and (current_time - self.last_active) > config.worker_disconnect_delay:
            self.reference = None
            self.last_active = None
            self.tasks = set()
```

With the `prune` method added to the `Worker` class, the provided failing test should now pass. The `prune` method checks if the worker has been inactive for longer than the `worker_disconnect_delay` specified in the configuration object and resets the worker's state if it has exceeded the allowed duration.
