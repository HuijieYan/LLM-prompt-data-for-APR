## Analysis:
1. The buggy function is the `__init__` method of the `Worker` class in the `luigi.scheduler` module.
2. The bug seems to be related to the `prune` method being called on the `Worker` object immediately after initialization.
3. The bug occurs because the `prune` method is not defined in the `Worker` class, but it is being called in the failing test. This results in an AttributeError.
4. To fix the bug, we need to define the `prune` method in the `Worker` class.

## Updated Corrected Code:
```python
# The corrected version of the buggy code

# The declaration of the class containing the corrected function
class Worker(object):
    """
    Structure for tracking worker activity and keeping their references.
    """
    def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
        self.id = worker_id
        self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
        self.last_active = last_active  # seconds since epoch
        self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        self.tasks = set()  # task objects
        self.info = {}

    def prune(self, cfg):
        """
        Prunes self from scheduler and calls worker_disconnect. cfg is the luigi
        configuration. If worker_disconnect raises an exception, it will be ignored.
        """
        if time.time() - self.last_active > cfg.worker_disconnect_delay:
            self.worker_disconnect()
``` 

With this correction, the `prune` method has been added to the `Worker` class. Now, when the failing test is run, the `prune` method can be called on the `Worker` object without any AttributeError.
