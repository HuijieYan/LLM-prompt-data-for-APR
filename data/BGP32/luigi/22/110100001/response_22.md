The bug in the `Worker` class `__init__` method is that it is missing the `prune` method that is being called in the test code. This method does not exist in the `Worker` class, hence the test is failing.

To fix this bug, we need to add the `prune` method to the `Worker` class. This method is used to remove inactive workers based on the specified configuration.

Here is the corrected version of the `Worker` class with the `prune` method added:

```python
# The corrected version of the buggy file: luigi/scheduler.py

import time

class Worker(object):
    """
    Structure for tracking worker activity and keeping their references.
    """

    def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
        self.id = worker_id
        self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
        self.last_active = last_active  # seconds since epoch
        self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        self.tasks = set()  # task objects
        self.info = {}

    def prune(self, config):
        """
        Prune inactive workers based on config settings.
        """
        current_time = time.time()
        if self.last_active is not None:
            if current_time - self.last_active > config.worker_disconnect_delay:
                # worker is inactive for more than the configured delay, remove it
                self.reference = None
                self.last_active = None
                self.tasks = set()

# Test function that was failing
def test_worker_prune_after_init():
    worker = Worker(123)

    class TmpCfg:
        def __init__(self):
            self.worker_disconnect_delay = 10

    worker.prune(TmpCfg())
```

Now, with the `prune` method added to the `Worker` class, the test `test_worker_prune_after_init` should pass successfully.
