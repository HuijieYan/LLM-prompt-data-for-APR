## Analysis:
The buggy function is the `__init__` method of the `Worker` class in the `luigi.scheduler` module. The bug is likely related to the initialization of the `Worker` object with `last_active` being set to `None`. This could lead to issues when calling the `prune` method on the `Worker` object.

## Identified Issue:
The bug arises from the fact that the `prune` method is expecting `last_active` to be set in the `Worker` object, but it is initially being set to `None` in the `__init__` method. This can cause unexpected behavior when trying to prune the worker based on `last_active` time.

## Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to modify the `__init__` method of the `Worker` class to properly handle the initialization of the `last_active` attribute. We can set a default value of `time.time()` for `last_active` if it is not provided during initialization.

## Corrected Version:
```python
import time

# The declaration of the class containing the buggy function
class Worker(object):
    """
    Structure for tracking worker activity and keeping their references.
    """

    def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
        self.id = worker_id
        self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
        self.last_active = last_active if last_active is not None else time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        self.tasks = set()  # task objects
        self.info = {}
```

By setting `self.last_active` to `time.time()` if `last_active` is `None`, we ensure that the `Worker` object will have a valid starting `last_active` time. This should resolve the bug and allow the `prune` method to work correctly with the `Worker` object.
