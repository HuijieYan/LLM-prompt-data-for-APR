### Analysis:
The buggy function `__init__` in the `Worker` class is missing part of the implementation required for the `prune` method to work correctly. The `prune` method is not part of the provided code but is referenced in the failing test.

### Identified Bug:
The `__init__` method of the `Worker` class is not setting a default value for `last_active` parameter, causing issues when trying to use `prune` method with a `Worker` object.

### Cause of the Bug:
The bug is caused by the missing default value for the `last_active` parameter in the `__init__` method. When the `Worker` object is initialized without specifying `last_active`, it leads to potential issues when accessing `last_active` in other methods or attributes of the `Worker` class.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to provide a default value for the `last_active` parameter in the `__init__` method. This default value should be set to `None` to avoid any issues related to accessing `last_active` in other parts of the class.

### Corrected Version:
```python
# The corrected version of the buggy function
class Worker(object):
    """
    Structure for tracking worker activity and keeping their references.
    """

    def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
        self.id = worker_id
        self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
        self.last_active = last_active if last_active is not None else time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        self.tasks = set()  # task objects
        self.info = {}
```

By providing `last_active=None` as a default value in the `__init__` method of the `Worker` class, the bug related to missing default initialization for `last_active` is fixed. This corrected version should now pass the failing test `test_worker_prune_after_init`.
