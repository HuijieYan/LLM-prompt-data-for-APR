### Analysis:
1. The `Worker` class has an `__init__` function that initializes the worker object.
2. The `__init__` function takes two parameters `worker_id` and `last_active`, where `last_active` is set to None by default.
3. The bug seems to be related to the `prune` method that is being called in the test function but is not defined in the `Worker` class.
4. The `prune` method should be defined in the `Worker` class to resolve this bug.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is caused by calling a method `prune` on the `Worker` object, but the `prune` method is not defined in the `Worker` class.

### Strategy for fixing the bug:
1. Define a `prune` method in the `Worker` class that takes the configuration object as a parameter.
2. Implement the logic to prune inactive workers based on the `worker_disconnect_delay` from the configuration object.

### Corrected Version:
```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: luigi/scheduler.py

class Worker(object):
    """
    Structure for tracking worker activity and keeping their references.
    """

    def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
        self.id = worker_id
        self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
        self.last_active = last_active  # seconds since epoch
        self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        self.tasks = set()  # task objects
        self.info = {}

    def prune(self, cfg):
        # Prune inactive workers
        current_time = time.time()
        disconnect_delay = cfg.worker_disconnect_delay
        if self.last_active is not None and current_time - self.last_active > disconnect_delay:
            # Worker is inactive, prune it
            self.reference = None
            self.last_active = None
            self.tasks = set()
            self.info = {}
```

By defining the `prune` method in the `Worker` class, the bug should be fixed and the corrected version should pass the failing test.
