## Analysis:
1. The buggy function `__init__` in the `Worker` class of `luigi/scheduler.py` is responsible for initializing a worker object with specific attributes.
2. The failing test `test_worker_prune_after_init` is calling the `prune` method on the `Worker` object created using the buggy `__init__` method.
3. The bug is likely related to the `prune` method expecting certain attributes to be correctly initialized in the `Worker` object, which might not be the case due to the buggy initialization in the `__init__` method.
4. To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the necessary attributes are initialized correctly in the `Worker` class.

## Bug Fix:
```python
# The corrected version of the buggy function
class Worker(object):
    """
    Structure for tracking worker activity and keeping their references.
    """

    def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
        self.id = worker_id
        self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
        self.last_active = last_active if last_active is not None else time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        self.tasks = set()  # task objects
        self.info = {}
```

In the corrected version:
- If `last_active` is not provided during initialization, it defaults to the current time using `time.time()`.
- This ensures that `last_active` is properly initialized if not explicitly provided, avoiding any potential issues in the `prune` method.

By making this change, the `Worker` object should now be initialized correctly and the failing test should pass without any issues.
