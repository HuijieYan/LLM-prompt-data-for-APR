The bug in the code is that the `prune()` method is being called on the `Worker` object in the test function, but the `Worker` class does not have a `prune()` method defined. This is causing the test to fail.

To fix this bug, we need to add a `prune()` method to the `Worker` class. The purpose of the `prune()` method seems to be related to worker disconnect and cleaning up tasks, so we will add a basic implementation for it.

Here is the corrected version of the code:

```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: luigi/scheduler.py

class Worker(object):
    """
    Structure for tracking worker activity and keeping their references.
    """

    def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
        self.id = worker_id
        self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
        self.last_active = last_active  # seconds since epoch
        self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        self.tasks = set()  # task objects
        self.info = {}
        
    def prune(self, config):
        for task in self.tasks.copy():
            if task.is_complete():
                self.tasks.remove(task)
```

Now, the `Worker` class has a `prune()` method that removes completed tasks from the worker's task set. This should address the bug in the test function.
