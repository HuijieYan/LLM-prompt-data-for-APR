### Analysis:
The buggy function `__init__` in the `Worker` class is missing the `prune` method which is being called in the failing test. This is causing the test to fail because the `Worker` class does not have the `prune` method implemented.

### Potential Error Locations:
1. Missing implementation of the `prune` method inside the `Worker` class.
2. Incorrect use of the `prune` method in the failing test.

### Cause of the Bug:
The bug is caused by the missing implementation of the `prune` method inside the `Worker` class. The failing test is trying to call this method on an instance of the `Worker` class, which leads to an AttributeError as the method does not exist.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
1. Implement the `prune` method inside the `Worker` class so that the failing test can successfully call it without causing an error.
2. The `prune` method should take a configuration parameter `cfg` and perform the necessary pruning operations based on the configuration.

### Corrected Version:
```python
# The corrected version of the buggy function
class Worker(object):
    """
    Structure for tracking worker activity and keeping their references.
    """

    def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
        self.id = worker_id
        self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
        self.last_active = last_active  # seconds since epoch
        self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        self.tasks = set()  # task objects
        self.info = {}

    def prune(self, cfg):
        current_time = time.time()
        if self.last_active is not None and current_time - self.last_active > cfg.worker_disconnect_delay:
            self.reference = None
            self.last_active = None
```

Now, the corrected version of the `Worker` class includes the `prune` method which will prune the worker based on the configuration passed to it. This will allow the failing test to call the `prune` method without any errors.
