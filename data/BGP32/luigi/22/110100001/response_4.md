### Analysis:
1. The buggy function is the `__init__` method inside the `Worker` class in the `luigi.scheduler` module.
2. The potential error location is where `self.last_active` is initialized with the `last_active` parameter.
3. The bug causes an issue when calling the `prune` method on a `Worker` instance because `last_active` is not properly initialized, leading to a type error.
4. To fix the bug, we need to handle the case when `last_active` is not provided during initialization.

### Corrected Version:
```python
class Worker(object):
    """
    Structure for tracking worker activity and keeping their references.
    """

    def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
        self.id = worker_id
        self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
        self.last_active = last_active if last_active is not None else time.time()  # seconds since epoch or current time
        self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        self.tasks = set()  # task objects
        self.info = {}

    def prune(self, cfg):
        # method implementation
        pass
```

By updating the initialization of `self.last_active` to use the provided `last_active` parameter if not `None`, or default to the current time using `time.time()`, we ensure that the `last_active` attribute is always properly set. This should fix the bug and make the `test_worker_prune_after_init` test pass.
