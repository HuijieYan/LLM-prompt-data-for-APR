The bug in the `__init__` function of the `Worker` class is caused by the `last_active` parameter being set to `None` initially, leading to a `TypeError` when trying to add an integer value to `None`. To fix this bug, we need to ensure that if `last_active` is not provided during initialization, it should be set to the current time.

Here is the corrected version of the `__init__` function:

```python
def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
    self.id = worker_id
    self.reference = None
    self.last_active = last_active if last_active is not None else time.time()
    self.started = time.time()
    self.tasks = set()
    self.info = {}
```

By checking if `last_active` is `None`, we set it to the current time using `time.time()` if it was not passed as an argument during object instantiation.

Now, the `Worker` class should be able to handle the `prune` method correctly without throwing a `TypeError`.
