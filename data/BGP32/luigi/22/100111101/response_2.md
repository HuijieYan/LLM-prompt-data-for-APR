### Bug Explanation
The bug occurs because the `last_active` parameter of the `__init__` function is optional and can be set to `None`. When the `prune` method is called and tries to access `self.last_active`, it causes a `TypeError` because `self.last_active` is `None` and cannot be added to an integer value.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to handle the case where `last_active` is `None` by providing a default value (e.g., the current time) if no value is provided when initializing the `Worker` object.

### Corrected Version of the Buggy Function
```python
def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
    self.id = worker_id
    self.reference = None
    self.last_active = last_active if last_active is not None else time.time()
    self.started = time.time()
    self.tasks = set()
    self.info = {}
``` 

By making this change, the `self.last_active` will default to the current time if no value is passed, preventing the `TypeError` in the `prune` method. This corrected version should pass the failing test case.
