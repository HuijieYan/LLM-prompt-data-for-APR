The issue in the provided buggy function is that the `last_active` variable is initialized as `None`, and in the `prune` method, there is an attempt to add an integer value to `None`, leading to a `TypeError`. To fix this issue, we need to ensure that if `last_active` is not provided during initialization, it defaults to a valid timestamp.

Here is the corrected version of the `__init__` function:

```python
def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
    self.id = worker_id
    self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
    self.last_active = last_active if last_active is not None else time.time()  # seconds since epoch or default to current time
    self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
    self.tasks = set()  # task objects
    self.info = {}
```

With this corrected version, the `last_active` variable will default to the current timestamp if not provided during initialization.

This modification should resolve the `TypeError` issue observed in the failing test case, and the corrected function should pass the test successfully.
