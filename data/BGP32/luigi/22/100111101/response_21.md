## Corrected Version of the Function

```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: luigi/scheduler.py

import time

class Worker:
    def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
        self.id = worker_id
        self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
        self.last_active = last_active if last_active is not None else time.time()  # seconds since epoch or current time
        self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        self.tasks = set()  # task objects
        self.info = {}

    def prune(self, config):
        # Delete workers that haven't said anything for a while (probably killed)
        if self.last_active + config.worker_disconnect_delay < time.time():
            # Delete worker
            pass
```

By checking if `last_active` is not `None` before assigning it to `self.last_active`, the corrected version of the function avoids the `TypeError` that occurs when trying to add `None` to an integer in the original buggy function, fixing the bug.
