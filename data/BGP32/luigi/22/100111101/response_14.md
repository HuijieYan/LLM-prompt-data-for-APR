The bug in the provided code is due to the `last_active` parameter being set to `None` initially. When the `prune` method is called, it tries to add `config.worker_disconnect_delay` (an integer) to `self.last_active`, which results in a TypeError due to adding an integer to `None`.

To fix this issue, we need to handle the case where `last_active` is `None` by initializing it with some default value (i.e., current time) if it is not provided during object creation.

Here is the corrected version of the `__init__` method:

```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: luigi/scheduler.py

import time

def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
    self.id = worker_id
    self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
    self.last_active = last_active if last_active is not None else time.time()  # seconds since epoch
    self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
    self.tasks = set()  # task objects
    self.info = {}
```

With this correction, the `last_active` parameter is set to the current time if it is not provided, preventing the TypeError when adding an integer to `None`.

This corrected version will ensure that the `prune` method and other operations on the `Worker` object work as expected without any errors.
