The issue in the buggy function is that the `last_active` parameter is defaulted to `None`, causing a `TypeError` when trying to add it to an integer in the `prune` method.

To fix this issue, we can set a default value for `last_active` to match the expected type for comparison with a timestamp. Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
import time

def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
    self.id = worker_id
    self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
    self.last_active = last_active if last_active is not None else time.time()  # seconds since epoch
    self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
    self.tasks = set()  # task objects
    self.info = {}
```

With this correction, the `last_active` parameter will default to the current time if no value is provided. This ensures that the comparison in the `prune` method works correctly and the function satisfies the expected input/output values.
