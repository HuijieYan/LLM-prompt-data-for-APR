The bug in the `__init__` function is that when `last_active` is not provided, it defaults to `None`, which causes an issue when trying to use it in the `prune` method. To fix this bug, we need to ensure that `last_active` is always initialized to a valid timestamp.

Here is the corrected version of the `__init__` function:

```python
def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
    self.id = worker_id
    self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
    
    if last_active is None:
        self.last_active = time.time()  # if last_active is not provided, default to current time
    else:
        self.last_active = last_active
    
    self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
    self.tasks = set()  # task objects
    self.info = {}
```

With this correction, the `last_active` parameter is set to the current time if not provided, avoiding the `NoneType` error when using it in the `prune` method.

This corrected version should pass the failing test and satisfy the expected input/output values outlined.
