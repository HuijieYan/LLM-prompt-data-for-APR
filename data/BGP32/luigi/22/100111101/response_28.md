The issue in the buggy function is that it assigns `None` to `self.last_active` in the `__init__` function, and then tries to perform addition with an integer. This leads to a `TypeError` as the operation is not supported between a `NoneType` and an `int`.

To fix this bug, we need to ensure that if `last_active` is not provided during the initialization, we set it to a default value that makes sense for comparison with an integer using addition.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
    self.id = worker_id
    self.reference = None
    self.last_active = last_active if last_active is not None else time.time()  # set to current time if last_active not provided
    self.started = time.time()
    self.tasks = set()
    self.info = {}
```

With this correction, the `last_active` parameter now defaults to the current time if not provided, ensuring that it is always a valid value for comparison with an integer.

This correction should make the `test_worker_prune_after_init` test pass and satisfy the expected input/output values.
