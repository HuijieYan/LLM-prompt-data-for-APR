### Explanation:
The error occurs because the `last_active` parameter in the `__init__` function is set to `None` by default, and when trying to add the `worker_disconnect_delay` to `None` in the `prune` function, a `TypeError` is raised due to unsupported operand types.

### Fix strategy:
To fix this issue, we need to handle the case where `last_active` is `None` correctly in the `__init__` function. We can initialize `last_active` to the current time if it is `None`.

### Corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
    self.id = worker_id
    self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
    self.last_active = last_active if last_active is not None else time.time() # seconds since epoch
    self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
    self.tasks = set()  # task objects
    self.info = {}

```
