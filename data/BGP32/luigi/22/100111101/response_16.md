The bug in the provided code is due to the `last_active` parameter being passed as `None` by default, and then the code tries to perform an arithmetic operation with `None` and an integer value, leading to a `TypeError`.

To fix this bug, we can modify the `__init__` function to handle the case where `last_active` is `None` and set it to the current time if it is not provided.

Here is the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
    self.id = worker_id
    self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
    self.last_active = last_active if last_active is not None else time.time()  # seconds since epoch
    self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
    self.tasks = set()  # task objects
    self.info = {}
```

By making this change, the function will correctly handle the case where `last_active` is `None`, setting it to the current time instead. This will prevent the `TypeError` from occurring when trying to add `None` to an integer value.

With this correction, the function should pass the failing test and produce the expected input/output values.
