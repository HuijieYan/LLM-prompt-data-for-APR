The issue in the current implementation is that the `last_active` parameter is set to `None`, and when trying to add it with an integer value in the `prune` method, it throws a `TypeError` due to unsupported operand types.

To fix this issue, we need to ensure that `last_active` is initialized correctly with the default value passed during the instance creation.

Here is the corrected version of the `__init__` function:

```python
def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
    self.id = worker_id
    self.reference = None
    self.last_active = last_active if last_active is not None else time.time()
    self.started = time.time()
    self.tasks = set()
    self.info = {}
```

With this correction, the `last_active` parameter will be initialized with the passed value if it's not `None`, otherwise, it will be set to the current time.

This fix should ensure that the `prune` method works correctly with the expected input/output values.
