The issue in the code stems from the `last_active` parameter being passed as `None` by default and then being used in a comparison with an integer value. This leads to a `TypeError` when trying to add `None` with an integer in the `prune` method.

To fix this issue, we need to check if `last_active` is `None` and handle it accordingly.
Here is the corrected version of the `__init__` method in the `luigi/scheduler.py` file:

```python
def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
    self.id = worker_id
    self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
    
    if last_active is None:
        self.last_active = time.time()  # set the current time if last_active is None
    else:
        self.last_active = last_active
    
    self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
    self.tasks = set()  # task objects
    self.info = {}
```

By checking if `last_active` is `None` and setting it to the current time if that's the case, we ensure that the comparison in the `prune` method will work correctly without raising a `TypeError`.

This correction ensures that the `Worker` object is initialized correctly, allowing the `prune` method to execute successfully without any errors.
