## Bug Explanation
The bug occurs because the `last_active` parameter in the `__init__` method of the `Worker` class is set to `None` by default, causing a potential `NoneType` error when trying to add it to an integer in the `prune` method. The `last_active` parameter should be initialized to the provided value (`last_active`) if it is not `None`.

## Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to check if the `last_active` parameter is `None` in the `__init__` method and assign `last_active` to it if it's not `None`. This way, the `last_active` variable will have a valid value and can be used without causing a `TypeError` later on when calling the `prune` method.

## The corrected version of the buggy function
```python
def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
    self.id = worker_id
    self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
    if last_active is not None:
        self.last_active = last_active  # seconds since epoch
    else:
        self.last_active = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
    self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
    self.tasks = set()  # task objects
    self.info = {}
``` 

By making this change, the `last_active` variable will be initialized correctly either to the provided value or to the current time if `None`. This will prevent the `TypeError` from occurring in the `prune` method.
