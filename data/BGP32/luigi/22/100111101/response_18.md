The issue in the provided buggy function is that the `last_active` parameter is set to `None` by default, but when accessed in the `prune` method, it results in a `TypeError` when trying to add an integer value to `None`.

To fix the bug, we need to handle the case where `last_active` is `None` and set it to a default value or handle it differently in the `prune` method.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
# The fixed version of the buggy function
def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
    self.id = worker_id
    self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
    self.last_active = last_active if last_active is not None else time.time()
    self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
    self.tasks = set()  # task objects
    self.info = {}
```

With this correction, the `last_active` parameter in the `__init__` method now gets the current time as a default value if `last_active` is `None`.

This fix will ensure that the `prune` method can correctly handle the case where `last_active` is `None`, preventing the `TypeError` encountered in the failing test case.
