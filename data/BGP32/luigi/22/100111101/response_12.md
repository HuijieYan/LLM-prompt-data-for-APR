The issue in the provided buggy function is that it does not handle the case where the `last_active` parameter is `None`, causing a `TypeError` when trying to add an integer value to `None`.

### Bug Cause:
- In the failing test `test_worker_prune_after_init`, the function `prune` is being called on a `Worker` object.
- Within the `prune` method, the code attempts to add the value of `config.worker_disconnect_delay` (an integer) to the value of `self.last_active`, which is passed as `None` during initialization.
- Since `self.last_active` is not initialized with a default value when it's `None`, the addition operation causes a `TypeError` due to adding an integer to `None`.

### Fix Strategy:
To fix this bug, we need to handle the case where `last_active` is `None` and provide a default value for it. We can assign the value of `time.time()` to `last_active` if it's not provided during initialization.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
    self.id = worker_id
    self.reference = None
    self.last_active = last_active if last_active is not None else time.time()
    self.started = time.time()
    self.tasks = set()
    self.info = {}
```

By initializing `self.last_active` with the current time as a default value if it's `None`, we ensure that the addition operation in the `prune` method will work correctly without raising a `TypeError`.
