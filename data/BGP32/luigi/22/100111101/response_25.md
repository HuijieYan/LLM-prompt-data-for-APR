### Bug Explanation
The bug occurs because the `last_active` parameter of the `__init__` function is set to `None` by default, but the `prune` function tries to add the `worker_disconnect_delay` (an integer) to it, causing a `TypeError`. The `last_active` value needs to be initialized properly.

### Bug Fix
To fix this issue, we need to initialize `last_active` with the current time if no value is provided. This way, it will always be a float representing the seconds since epoch.

### Corrected Version
```python
def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
    self.id = worker_id
    self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
    self.last_active = last_active if last_active is not None else time.time()  # seconds since epoch
    self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
    self.tasks = set()  # task objects
    self.info = {}
``` 

By initializing `last_active` correctly in the `__init__` function, the bug should be fixed, and the failing test should now pass with the corrected version.
