The bug in the `__init__` method of the `Worker` class is that it initializes the `last_active` attribute with a default value of `None`, causing a `TypeError` when trying to add it to an integer value in the `prune` method.

To fix this bug, we need to ensure that when `last_active` is not provided, it defaults to the current time as an integer. 

Here is the corrected version of the `__init__` method:

```python
def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
    self.id = worker_id
    self.reference = None
    self.last_active = last_active if last_active is not None else int(time.time())  # Initialize with current time if last_active is None
    self.started = time.time()
    self.tasks = set()
    self.info = {}
```

With this correction, the `last_active` attribute will default to the current time as an integer when not provided, avoiding the `TypeError` in the `prune` method. Now the test case `test_worker_prune_after_init` should pass successfully.
