The issue in the buggy function arises from the initialization of `last_active` as `None`, which causes a `NoneType` error when trying to perform addition with an `int` value. To fix this bug, we need to ensure that `last_active` is initialized as a float value if it's not provided during object creation.

Here is the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
    self.id = worker_id
    self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
    self.last_active = last_active if last_active is not None else time.time()  # seconds since epoch if last_active not provided
    self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
    self.tasks = set()  # task objects
    self.info = {}
```

With this correction, the `last_active` will default to the current time in epoch seconds if not provided, ensuring that no `NoneType` error occurs during the operation.

Now, when the failing test `test_worker_prune_after_init` is executed using the corrected function, it should pass without any errors.
