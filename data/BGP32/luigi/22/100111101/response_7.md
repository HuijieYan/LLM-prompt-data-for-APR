### Bug Explanation
The bug occurs because the `last_active` parameter in the `__init__` function is defaulted to `None`. In the failing test `test_worker_prune_after_init`, the `prune` method is called with a `config` object that contains a `worker_disconnect_delay` attribute. When trying to compare `self.last_active` (which is `None`) with an integer value in the `prune` method, a `TypeError` is raised because you cannot add an integer to `None`.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that `last_active` is properly initialized with a default value other than `None` in the `__init__` function of the `Worker` class.

### Corrected Code
```python
def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=0):
    self.id = worker_id
    self.reference = None
    self.last_active = last_active
    self.started = time.time()
    self.tasks = set()
    self.info = {}
``` 

By setting `last_active` to a default value of `0`, we ensure that it is always an integer and can be compared with the `worker_disconnect_delay` value without raising a `TypeError`. This correction should allow the failing test to pass successfully.
