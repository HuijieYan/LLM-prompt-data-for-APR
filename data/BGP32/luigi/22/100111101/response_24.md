The issue in the buggy function arises from the `last_active` parameter being passed as `None`, causing a `TypeError` when trying to add it to an integer value in the `prune` method.

To fix this issue, we can modify the `__init__` method to handle the case where `last_active` is `None` by assigning a default value using an `if` statement.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
    self.id = worker_id
    self.reference = None
    if last_active is not None:
        self.last_active = last_active
    else:
        self.last_active = time.time()  # Assign current time if last_active is None
    self.started = time.time()
    self.tasks = set()
    self.info = {}
```

By making this adjustment, the `last_active` parameter will default to the current time if not explicitly provided, preventing the `TypeError` when comparing it with an integer in the `prune` method.

This correction ensures that the function behaves as expected and passes the failing test case.
