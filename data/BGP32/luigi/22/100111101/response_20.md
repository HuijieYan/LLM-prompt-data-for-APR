The issue in the buggy function is that the `last_active` parameter is set to `None` by default, causing a `TypeError` when trying to add it to an integer in the `prune` method. To fix this bug, we need to initialize `last_active` with a default value of `None` and then assign the `last_active` parameter to the `self.last_active` attribute in the `__init__` method.

Here is the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
import time

def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
    self.id = worker_id
    self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
    self.last_active = last_active if last_active is not None else time.time()  # seconds since epoch or current time
    self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
    self.tasks = set()  # task objects
    self.info = {}
```

With this correction, the `last_active` parameter will default to the current time if it is not provided during the initialization of the `Worker` object. This change ensures that the `prune` method can compare `self.last_active` with an integer without raising a `TypeError`.

The corrected version should now pass the failing test scenario.
