The cause of the bug in the `__init__` method of the `Worker` class is that the `last_active` parameter is set to `None` by default, causing a `TypeError` when trying to add it to an integer value in the `prune` method.

To fix this bug, we should assign the `last_active` parameter the current time in seconds since epoch if it is not provided during initialization.

Here is the corrected version of the `__init__` method:

```python
import time

def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
    self.id = worker_id
    self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
    self.last_active = last_active if last_active is not None else time.time()  # seconds since epoch
    self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
    self.tasks = set()  # task objects
    self.info = {}
```

With this modification, the `last_active` parameter will default to the current time if not provided, resolving the `TypeError` in the `prune` method during the test execution.
