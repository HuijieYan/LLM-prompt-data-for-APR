The bug in the provided function is that the `last_active` parameter is set to `None` by default, but when trying to add it with an integer value in the `prune` method, it causes a `TypeError` because you cannot add an integer to a `NoneType`.

To fix this bug, we need to check if `last_active` is `None` before performing any operation with it and set it to the current time if it is `None`.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
# The corrected function
def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
    self.id = worker_id
    self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
    self.last_active = last_active if last_active is not None else time.time()  # seconds since epoch
    self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
    self.tasks = set()  # task objects
    self.info = {}
```

With this modification, the function will set the `last_active` to the current time if it is `None`, and the `prune` method should work correctly without causing any `TypeError`.
