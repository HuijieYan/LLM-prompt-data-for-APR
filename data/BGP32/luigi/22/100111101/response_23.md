The bug in the provided function is caused by the `last_active` parameter being set to `None` as a default value. This leads to a `TypeError` when trying to add an integer value to `None` in the `prune` method. To fix this bug, we need to initialize `last_active` to a default value if it is `None` when creating a new `Worker` instance.

Here is the corrected version of the `__init__` function:
```python
def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
    self.id = worker_id
    self.reference = None
    self.last_active = last_active if last_active is not None else time.time()  # Initialize to current time if last_active is None
    self.started = time.time()
    self.tasks = set()
    self.info = {}
```

With this correction, the `last_active` parameter is initialized to the current time if it is `None`, ensuring that it is always a valid timestamp.

Now, the buggy function should work correctly with the provided failing test, and the expected input/output values should match.
