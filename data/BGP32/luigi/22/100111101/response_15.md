The bug in the provided function is due to the `last_active` parameter having a default value of `None` and then being used in the `prune` method without proper handling. The error occurs when attempting to add an integer value to `None`.

To fix this bug, we need to check if the `last_active` parameter is `None` in the `__init__` method and handle it appropriately by assigning the current time if it is `None`.

Here is the corrected version of the `__init__` method:

```python
def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
    self.id = worker_id
    self.reference = None
    if last_active is None:
        self.last_active = time.time()
    else:
        self.last_active = last_active
    self.started = time.time()
    self.tasks = set()
    self.info = {}
```

By adding the check for `None` in the `__init__` method, we ensure that the `last_active` value is always initialized properly before being used in the `prune` method.

This correction should resolve the TypeError issue and make the `test_worker_prune_after_init` test pass successfully.
