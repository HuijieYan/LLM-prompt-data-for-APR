The bug in the `__init__` method of the `Worker` class is caused by the `last_active` parameter being set to `None`, and then trying to add an integer to it in the `prune` method. This results in a `TypeError` because you cannot add an integer to `None`.

To fix this bug, you should initialize `last_active` with a default value that can be used in arithmetic operations. One common approach is to set it to the current time when it is not provided. Here is the corrected version of the `__init__` method:

```python
class Worker:
    def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
        self.id = worker_id
        self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
        if last_active is None:  # Check if last_active is provided
            self.last_active = time.time()  # Set to current time if not provided
        else:
            self.last_active = last_active
        self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        self.tasks = set()  # task objects
        self.info = {}
```

With this correction, the `last_active` parameter in the `__init__` method now defaults to the current time if not provided, ensuring that it is always a valid value for arithmetic operations.

This corrected version should resolve the `TypeError` issue in the failing test `test_worker_prune_after_init`, and the expected values and types specified for the variables during the test execution should be achieved.
