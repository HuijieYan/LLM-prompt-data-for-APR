Based on the error message and the provided information, the issue in the `Worker` class's `__init__` method is that the `last_active` parameter can be `None`, and later in the code, it tries to add it with an integer value causing a `TypeError`. The fix involves handling the case where `last_active` is `None` before performing any arithmetic operations with it.

Here is the corrected version of the `__init__` method:

```python
def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
    self.id = worker_id
    self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
    self.last_active = last_active if last_active is not None else time.time()  # seconds since epoch
    self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
    self.tasks = set()  # task objects
    self.info = {}
```

By modifying the assignment of `self.last_active`, we ensure that if `last_active` is `None`, it defaults to the current time using `time.time()` when initializing the worker object.

The corrected version should now pass the failing test and meet the expected input/output values. Additionally, this fix allows for more flexibility when initializing a worker with or without providing the `last_active` parameter.
