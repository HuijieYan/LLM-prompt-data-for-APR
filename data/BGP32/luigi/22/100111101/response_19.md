The bug in the `__init__` method of the `luigi.scheduler.Worker` class arises from the `last_active` parameter being set to `None` initially, causing a `TypeError` when trying to compare it with an integer in the `prune` method.

To fix this bug, we need to ensure that `last_active` is set to a default value of `time.time()` if it is not provided during initialization.

Here is the corrected version of the `__init__` method:

```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: luigi/scheduler.py

def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
    self.id = worker_id
    self.reference = None
    self.last_active = last_active if last_active is not None else time.time()
    self.started = time.time()
    self.tasks = set()
    self.info = {}
```

By setting `last_active` to `time.time()` if it is `None`, we ensure that it always holds a valid timestamp value. This correction addresses the `TypeError` that was occurring during the `prune` method call in the failing test.
