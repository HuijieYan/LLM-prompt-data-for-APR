The issue in the buggy function is that the `last_active` parameter could be None, leading to a TypeError when trying to add it to an integer in the `prune` method.

To fix this issue, we can update the `__init__` method to handle the case where `last_active` is None by assigning a default value to `last_active` using an if statement.

Here is the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
# The corrected version of the buggy function
def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
    self.id = worker_id
    self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
    self.last_active = last_active if last_active is not None else time.time()  # seconds since epoch or current time
    self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
    self.tasks = set()  # task objects
    self.info = {}
```

With this correction, if `last_active` is passed as None during the initialization of a Worker object, it will default to the current time using `time.time()`.

This adjustment should resolve the TypeError issue encountered in the failing test.
