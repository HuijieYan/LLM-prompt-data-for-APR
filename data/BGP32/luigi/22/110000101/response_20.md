The bug in the provided function is that the `last_active` parameter is not correctly assigned when the `Worker` object is initialized. Instead, it defaults to `None`, which is different from the expected value of `1709218610.8782065`.

To fix this bug, we need to explicitly assign the `last_active` parameter passed to the `__init__` method to the `self.last_active` attribute inside the `Worker` class.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
class Worker(object):
    """
    Structure for tracking worker activity and keeping their references.
    """

    def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
        self.id = worker_id
        self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
        self.last_active = last_active if last_active is not None else time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        self.tasks = set()  # task objects
        self.info = {}
```

With this correction, the `last_active` attribute will be assigned the value passed in the parameter when creating a new `Worker` object. If no value is provided, it will default to the current time using `time.time()` function.
