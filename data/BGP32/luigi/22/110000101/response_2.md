### Analysis
The buggy function is the `__init__` constructor of the `Worker` class. It initializes various attributes of a worker object with the provided `worker_id` and `last_active` time. The bug seems to be that `last_active` is not correctly assigned and remains as `None` when not provided during object creation.

### Bug Explanation
The bug in the current implementation is that the `last_active` parameter is not assigned correctly when it is provided during object creation. This leads to the `last_active` attribute of the `Worker` object being `None` even if a value was intended to be assigned.

### Bug Fix Strategy
1. Check if the `last_active` parameter is provided during object creation.
2. If provided, assign the value of `last_active` to the `last_active` attribute of the `Worker` object.
3. If not provided, set the `last_active` attribute to `None`.

### Corrected Code
```python
class Worker(object):
    """
    Structure for tracking worker activity and keeping their references.
    """

    def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
        self.id = worker_id
        self.reference = None
        self.last_active = last_active if last_active is not None else None
        self.started = time.time()
        self.tasks = set()
        self.info = {}
```
