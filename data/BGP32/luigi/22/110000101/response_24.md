### Analysis
The bug in the current implementation is that the `last_active` parameter is not being correctly set for the `Worker` object. It is defaulting to None in the constructor, but the expected input value is a float representing the seconds since epoch.

### Bug Cause
The bug is caused by the incorrect handling of the `last_active` parameter in the `__init__` method of the `Worker` class. It should be properly assigned the input value instead of defaulting to None.

### Fix Strategy
The fix is to update the `__init__` method to correctly assign the `last_active` parameter to the `self.last_active` attribute.

### Corrected Implementation
```python
class Worker(object):
    """
    Structure for tracking worker activity and keeping their references.
    """

    def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
        self.id = worker_id
        self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
        self.last_active = last_active if last_active is not None else time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        self.tasks = set()  # task objects
        self.info = {}
```
