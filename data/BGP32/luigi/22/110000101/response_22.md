### Analysis
The bug in the provided function is that the `last_active` parameter is not being assigned correctly. Instead of setting it to the value passed as an argument, it is being set to `None`. This leads to incorrect initialization of the `last_active` attribute.

### Bug Explanation
The bug occurs in the `__init__` method where the `last_active` parameter is not correctly assigned to the `self.last_active` attribute. This results in the `self.last_active` attribute always being set to `None` regardless of the input value.

### Bug Fix
To fix the bug, we need to modify the initialization of the `self.last_active` attribute to assign the `last_active` parameter value. 

### Corrected Version
```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: luigi/scheduler.py

# The declaration of the class containing the corrected function
class Worker(object):
    """
    Structure for tracking worker activity and keeping their references.
    """

    def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
        self.id = worker_id
        self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
        self.last_active = last_active if last_active is not None else time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        self.tasks = set()  # task objects
        self.info = {}
``` 

Now, the corrected version of the `__init__` method properly assigns the `last_active` parameter value to the `self.last_active` attribute if the `last_active` parameter is not `None`. Otherwise, it assigns the current time using `time.time()`. This fix ensures that the `self.last_active` attribute is initialized correctly based on the input provided.
