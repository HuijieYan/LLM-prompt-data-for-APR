### Analysis
The bug in the provided function is that the `last_active` parameter is not being assigned properly to the `last_active` instance variable. The `last_active` parameter is being assigned to the `last_active` attribute of the instance itself, causing the instance to have two different variables with the same value. This can lead to confusion and unintended behavior.

### Bug Cause
In the buggy function, the `last_active` parameter is assigned directly to the class attribute `last_active` instead of assigning it to the instance attribute `last_active`. This causes the function to not correctly initialize the instance variable `last_active`.

### Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, the `last_active` parameter should be assigned to the instance attribute `self.last_active` instead of the class attribute `last_active`.

### Corrected Version
```python
class Worker(object):
    """
    Structure for tracking worker activity and keeping their references.
    """

    def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
        self.id = worker_id
        self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
        self.last_active = last_active  # seconds since epoch
        self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        self.tasks = set()  # task objects
        self.info = {}
```
