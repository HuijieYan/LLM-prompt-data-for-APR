### Analysis
The buggy function is the `__init__` method of the `Worker` class. It initializes the attributes of the worker object. The bug seems to be related to the incorrect initialization of the `last_active` attribute. The `last_active` attribute should be set to the provided `last_active` parameter if it is not `None`, otherwise, it should be set to the current time.

### Bug Explanation
The bug in the current implementation is that the `last_active` attribute is always being set to the value of the `last_active` parameter, even if it is `None`. This results in the `last_active` attribute not being initialized correctly, leading to unexpected behavior.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to check if the `last_active` parameter is `None` and then initialize the `last_active` attribute accordingly.

### The corrected version of the function
```python
class Worker(object):
    """
    Structure for tracking worker activity and keeping their references.
    """

    def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
        self.id = worker_id
        self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
        if last_active is not None:
            self.last_active = last_active
        else:
            self.last_active = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        self.tasks = set()  # task objects
        self.info = {}
```

By checking if the `last_active` parameter is not `None`, we ensure that the `last_active` attribute is initialized correctly either with the provided value or the current time. This correction will now satisfy the expected input/output values for the function.
