### Analysis
The buggy function `__init__` in the `Worker` class is meant to initialize a worker object with the provided `worker_id`, `last_active`, and other attributes. However, the bug exists in the assignment of `last_active` and `started` variables. 

The bug is caused by incorrectly initializing the `last_active` variable with the input `last_active`, which should represent the time when the worker was last active in seconds since epoch. This leads to a discrepancy in the value of `last_active`.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we should correct the assignment of the `last_active` variable to reflect the provided input value accurately. Additionally, the `started` variable should be initialized separately after `last_active` is handled correctly.

### Corrected Code
```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: luigi/scheduler.py

# The declaration of the class containing the corrected function
class Worker:
    """
    Structure for tracking worker activity and keeping their references.
    """

    def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
        self.id = worker_id
        self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
        self.last_active = last_active if last_active is not None else time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        self.tasks = set()  # task objects
        self.info = {}
```

Now the corrected code initializes the `last_active` attribute correctly based on the provided input or the current time if no input is given. The `started` attribute is then initialized separately after `last_active` to ensure accuracy in tracking the worker's activity.
