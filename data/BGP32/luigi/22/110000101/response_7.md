The bug in the provided function is that the `last_active` parameter is not correctly assigned to the `last_active` attribute of the Worker class. Instead, it is assigned to `self.last_active`, which results in `last_active` being `None` by default.

To fix this bug, we need to update the assignment of `last_active` within the `__init__` function to correctly assign the input parameter `last_active` to the `self.last_active` attribute.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: luigi/scheduler.py

# The declaration of the class containing the corrected function
class Worker(object):
    """
    Structure for tracking worker activity and keeping their references.
    """

    def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
        self.id = worker_id
        self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
        self.last_active = last_active  # seconds since epoch
        self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        self.tasks = set()  # task objects
        self.info = {}
```

This corrected version ensures that the `last_active` parameter is correctly assigned to the `self.last_active` attribute, satisfying the expected input/output values as described in the test case.
