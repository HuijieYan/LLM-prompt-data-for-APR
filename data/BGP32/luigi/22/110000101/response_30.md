### Analysis
The buggy function `__init__` in the `Worker` class initializes the instance variables `id`, `reference`, `last_active`, `started`, `tasks`, and `info`. The issue in the buggy function is that the `last_active` parameter is not assigned to the `last_active` instance variable if it's provided. This results in `last_active` being set to `None` even when a value is passed.

### Bug Explanation
The bug occurs because the `last_active` parameter provided when initializing the `Worker` object is not utilized to set the `last_active` instance variable. Instead, the default value of `None` is assigned to `last_active`.

### Bug Fix
To fix the bug, we need to check if the `last_active` parameter is provided when the `Worker` object is initialized. If a value is provided, it should be assigned to the `last_active` instance variable. Otherwise, the default value of `None` should be used.

### Corrected Version
```python
class Worker(object):
    """
    Structure for tracking worker activity and keeping their references.
    """

    def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
        self.id = worker_id
        self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
        if last_active is not None:
            self.last_active = last_active
        else:
            self.last_active = None
        self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        self.tasks = set()  # task objects
        self.info = {}
```
