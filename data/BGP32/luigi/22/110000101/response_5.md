### Analysis
The buggy function is the `__init__` constructor of the `Worker` class. The function is intended to initialize the `Worker` object with the provided `worker_id`, `last_active`, and other attributes. The bug seems to be related to the incorrect initialization of the `last_active` attribute with the value of `time.time()` instead of the provided `last_active` parameter.

### Bug Cause
The bug causes the `last_active` attribute to always be initialized with the current timestamp (`time.time()`) instead of the provided `last_active` parameter. This leads to incorrect data assignments and potentially unexpected behavior in the `Worker` object.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, the `last_active` attribute should be initialized with the provided `last_active` parameter if it's not `None`. Otherwise, it should default to `None`.
Additionally, ensure that the other attributes are correctly assigned based on the provided input parameters.

### Corrected Version of the Function
```python
class Worker(object):
    """
    Structure for tracking worker activity and keeping their references.
    """
    
    def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
        self.id = worker_id
        self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
        self.last_active = last_active if last_active is not None else None
        self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        self.tasks = set()  # task objects
        self.info = {}
```

With this correction, the `last_active` attribute will now correctly default to `None` if no value is provided or will be set to the provided `last_active` value. The rest of the attributes will continue to be initialized as before.
