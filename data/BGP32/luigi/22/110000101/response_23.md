The bug in the provided function is that the last_active parameter is passed incorrectly. When this parameter is not provided when instantiating an object of the Worker class, it should default to None. However, in the buggy function, it is being assigned the value of last_active, instead of just setting it to None.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the __init__ function to correctly handle the default value for last_active when it is not provided.

Here is the corrected version of the function:
```python
class Worker(object):
    """
    Structure for tracking worker activity and keeping their references.
    """

    def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
        self.id = worker_id
        self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
        self.last_active = last_active if last_active is not None else None  # seconds since epoch
        self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        self.tasks = set()  # task objects
        self.info = {}
```

With this correction, the last_active parameter will default to None if not provided, as expected. This ensures that the function behaves correctly according to the specified input/output values.
