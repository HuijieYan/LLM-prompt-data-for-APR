The bug in the provided function is that the `last_active` parameter is not being assigned correctly. Instead of using the given `last_active` value if it's not None, the function is directly assigning the default value of `None` to `last_active`. This causes the `last_active` variable to be incorrect in some cases.

To fix this bug, we should modify the `__init__` function to check if the `last_active` parameter is provided and use it if it's not None.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
class Worker(object):
    """
    Structure for tracking worker activity and keeping their references.
    """

    def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
        self.id = worker_id
        self.reference = None
        self.last_active = last_active if last_active is not None else time.time()
        self.started = time.time()
        self.tasks = set()
        self.info = {}
```

By using the ternary operator in the assignment of `last_active`, we ensure that the `last_active` parameter is correctly assigned either the given value or the current time if it's None. This corrected version should satisfy the expected input/output values provided.
