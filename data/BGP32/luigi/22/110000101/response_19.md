### Analysis
The buggy function is the `__init__` method of the `Worker` class, which is supposed to initialize the attributes of a `Worker` object. However, there is a potential bug in the `last_active` attribute assignment. The `last_active` attribute takes a default value of `None`, but then it is overwritten by the value provided as an argument, which might lead to unexpected behavior.

### Bug Cause
The bug in the current implementation is that the `last_active` attribute is set to `None` in the function definition, but then it is immediately reassigned to the value provided in the function call, which could be `None` or a specific timestamp. This inconsistency could lead to confusion and potential bugs when checking the `last_active` attribute.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug
To fix the bug, we should remove the default assignment of `None` to `last_active` in the function signature. Instead, assign the value provided in the function call directly, which ensures consistency and clarity in the code.

### Corrected Version of the Function

```python
    def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active):
        self.id = worker_id
        self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
        self.last_active = last_active  # seconds since epoch
        self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        self.tasks = set()  # task objects
        self.info = {}
```
