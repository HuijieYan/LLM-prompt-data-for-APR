### Analysis
The buggy function `__init__` in the `Worker` class is supposed to initialize various attributes of a worker object. The bug seems to be in the initialization of the `last_active` attribute. It is receiving a default value of `None`, but in the expected case, it should be initialized with the provided value when available.

### Bug Explanation
The bug occurs because the `last_active` attribute is always set to `None` in the buggy implementation, ignoring the provided value. This leads to incorrect initialization of the `last_active` attribute, causing mismatches in the expected values.

### Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to check if a value for `last_active` is provided during the object creation. If a value is provided, initialize the `last_active` attribute with that value; otherwise, initialize it with `None`.

### The corrected version of the function
```python
class Worker(object):
    """
    Structure for tracking worker activity and keeping their references.
    """

    def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
        self.id = worker_id
        self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
        
        # Initialize last_active based on the provided value or None
        if last_active is not None:
            self.last_active = last_active
        else:
            self.last_active = None
        
        self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        self.tasks = set()  # task objects
        self.info = {}
```

With this corrected version, the function will properly initialize the `last_active` attribute based on the provided value or set it to `None` if no value is provided. This ensures that the expected values match the actual values during object creation.
