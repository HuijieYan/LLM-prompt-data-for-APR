### Analysis
The bug in the buggy function lies in the way the `last_active` parameter is handled. The `last_active` parameter is intended to be an optional parameter representing the time of the worker's last activity in seconds since epoch. However, the `last_active` parameter is not being properly assigned to `self.last_active` within the `__init__` function, leading to unexpected behavior.

### Cause of the Bug
The bug occurs because the `last_active` parameter is not being properly assigned to `self.last_active` within the `__init__` function. Instead, it is being assigned to `self.started`, causing incorrect initialization of the class attributes.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to correctly assign the `last_active` parameter to `self.last_active` within the `__init__` function and ensure that `self.id`, `self.started`, `self.tasks`, and `self.info` are initialized correctly.

### The corrected version of the buggy function
```python
class Worker(object):
    """
    Structure for tracking worker activity and keeping their references.
    """
    
    def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
        self.id = worker_id
        self.reference = None
        self.last_active = last_active if last_active is not None else time.time()  # Assign last_active parameter if provided, else assign current time
        self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        self.tasks = set()  # task objects
        self.info = {}
```

By making the correction mentioned above, the function now correctly assigns the `last_active` parameter to `self.last_active` and initializes the other attributes correctly.
