## Analysis
The buggy function `__init__` within the `Worker` class is supposed to initialize various attributes of a worker instance. The bug in the function lies in the assignment of the `last_active` attribute. The `last_active` attribute should default to None if no value is provided, but it is initialized incorrectly.

## Bug
The bug occurs because the `last_active` parameter is set to None in the function signature. However, when setting the attribute `self.last_active`, it is not checked whether the `last_active` parameter is None. As a result, the wrong default value is used, leading to unexpected behavior.

## Fix
To fix the bug, we need to check if the `last_active` parameter is None and assign it to the `self.last_active` attribute accordingly.

## The corrected version of the buggy function
```python
class Worker(object):
    """
    Structure for tracking worker activity and keeping their references.
    """

    def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
        self.id = worker_id
        self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
        
        if last_active is not None:
            self.last_active = last_active
        else:
            self.last_active = None
        
        self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        self.tasks = set()  # task objects
        self.info = {}
```

With this correction, the `last_active` parameter is checked for None and assigned correctly to the `self.last_active` attribute. This fix ensures that the function behaves as expected in all cases.
