### Explanation
The bug in the `__init__` function is that the `last_active` parameter is not being assigned properly. The parameter `last_active` is being passed to the function, but it is not being used to initialize the `self.last_active` attribute correctly. Instead, the `self.last_active` attribute is being initialized with the current time (`time.time()`).

### Strategy for fixing the bug
To fix the bug, we need to assign the `last_active` parameter to the `self.last_active` attribute in the `__init__` function.

### Corrected code
```python
class Worker(object):
    """
    Structure for tracking worker activity and keeping their references.
    """

    def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
        self.id = worker_id
        self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
        self.last_active = last_active  # assign the last_active parameter to self.last_active
        self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        self.tasks = set()  # task objects
        self.info = {}
``` 

Now the `last_active` parameter will correctly initialize the `self.last_active` attribute in the `Worker` class.
