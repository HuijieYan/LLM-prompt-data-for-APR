### Analysis
The buggy function `__init__` in the `Worker` class is initializing the `worker_id`, `last_active`, `started`, `tasks`, and `info` attributes of the class. The bug seems to be in the initialization of the `last_active` attribute, which does not handle the case where `last_active` is provided as an argument.

### Bug Explanation
The bug occurs in the `__init__` function because the `last_active` parameter is not correctly assigned to the `self.last_active` attribute. Instead, the provided default value of `None` remains unchanged in the attribute.

### Bug Fix
To fix the bug, we need to update the assignment of the `last_active` parameter to the `self.last_active` attribute in the `__init__` function.

### Corrected Version
```python
class Worker(object):
    """
    Structure for tracking worker activity and keeping their references.
    """

    def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
        self.id = worker_id
        self.reference = None
        self.last_active = last_active if last_active is not None else time.time()
        self.started = time.time()
        self.tasks = set()
        self.info = {}
``` 

In the corrected version, if `last_active` is provided as an argument, it will be assigned to `self.last_active`. Otherwise, the current time (`time.time()`) will be used as the default value.
