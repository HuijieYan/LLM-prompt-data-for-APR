### Analysis
The buggy function `__init__` is supposed to initialize instances of the `Worker` class with the provided `worker_id` and `last_active` values, setting default values for other attributes. The bug in this function is that the `last_active` parameter is not directly assigned to `self.last_active`.

### Cause of the Bug
The bug occurs because the `last_active` parameter is not assigned to `self.last_active` in the `__init__` function. Instead, the default value `None` is assigned to `self.last_active`. This causes `self.last_active` to always be `None`, regardless of the input value.

### Fixing the Bug
To fix the bug, the `last_active` parameter should be directly assigned to `self.last_active` in the `__init__` function.

### Corrected Version
```python
import time

class Worker(object):
    """
    Structure for tracking worker activity and keeping their references.
    """

    def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
        self.id = worker_id
        self.reference = None
        self.last_active = last_active if last_active is not None else time.time()
        self.started = time.time()
        self.tasks = set()
        self.info = {}
``` 

With this correction, the `last_active` parameter will be correctly assigned to `self.last_active` if a value is provided, otherwise, the current time will be used as the default value.
