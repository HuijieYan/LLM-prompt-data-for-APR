The bug in the provided function is that the `self.last_active` attribute is being set incorrectly. The `self.last_active` should be set to the value of the `last_active` parameter if it is provided, otherwise it should default to `None`.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the initialization of `self.last_active` in the `__init__` function. If `last_active` is `None`, we should set `self.last_active` to `None`, otherwise we should set it to the value of `last_active`.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
import time

class Worker(object):
    """
    Structure for tracking worker activity and keeping their references.
    """

    def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
        self.id = worker_id
        self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
        self.last_active = last_active if last_active is not None else None  # seconds since epoch
        self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        self.tasks = set()  # task objects
        self.info = {}
```

This corrected version ensures that the `last_active` attribute is set correctly based on the input parameter value.
