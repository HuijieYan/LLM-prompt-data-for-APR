### Explanation
The bug in the current function lies in the assignment of the `last_active` parameter. The intention is to assign it the value provided as the parameter if it is not `None`, otherwise assign the current time. However, the bug is that it is always assigned the current time, regardless of the `last_active` parameter.

### Strategy for fixing the bug
To fix the bug, we need to modify the logic in the `__init__` function to properly handle the `last_active` parameter and only assign the current time if it is `None`.

### The corrected version of the function
```python
class Worker(object):
    """
    Structure for tracking worker activity and keeping their references.
    """

    def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
        self.id = worker_id
        self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
        self.last_active = last_active if last_active is not None else time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        self.tasks = set()  # task objects
        self.info = {}
```
