The bug in the provided code is that the `last_active` parameter is not directly assigned to `self.last_active` in the `__init__` function of the `Worker` class. As a result, the `last_active` parameter is not correctly initialized when creating a new Worker object.

To fix this bug, we need to assign the `last_active` parameter to `self.last_active` in the `__init__` function.

Here is the corrected version of the code:

```python
import time

class Worker(object):
    """
    Structure for tracking worker activity and keeping their references.
    """

    def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
        self.id = worker_id
        self.reference = None  
        self.last_active = last_active if last_active is not None else time.time()
        self.started = time.time()  
        self.tasks = set()  
        self.info = {}
```

This corrected version ensures that the `last_active` parameter is properly assigned to `self.last_active` when creating a new `Worker` object.
