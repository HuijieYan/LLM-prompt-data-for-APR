### Analysis
The buggy function `__init__` in the `Worker` class is supposed to initialize the attributes of a `Worker` object. However, the issue lies in the way the `last_active` attribute is handled during initialization. The `last_active` attribute is set to the provided value or `None` if no value is provided. This causes a problem because when `last_active` is not provided, it defaults to `None`, but the expected behavior is to use the current time as the default value. This results in unexpected behavior when accessing or comparing the `last_active` attribute later on.

### Bug Explanation
The bug occurs because the `last_active` attribute is not initialized correctly when a value is not provided during object creation. This leads to inconsistencies when comparing or accessing the `last_active` attribute.

### Bug Fix
To fix the bug, we need to update the initialization of the `last_active` attribute to default to the current time when no value is provided. This ensures that the `last_active` attribute always contains a valid timestamp.

### Corrected Version
```python
import time

class Worker(object):
    """
    Structure for tracking worker activity and keeping their references.
    """

    def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
        self.id = worker_id
        self.reference = None
        self.last_active = last_active if last_active is not None else time.time()
        self.started = time.time()
        self.tasks = set()
        self.info = {}
``` 

After applying this fix, the `last_active` attribute will default to the current time if no value is provided, ensuring consistent behavior and fulfilling the expected input/output values for the `Worker` class.
