### Explanation
The bug in the current implementation is that the `last_active` parameter is not correctly assigned to the `last_active` attribute in the `__init__` function of the `Worker` class. Instead, it is assigned to the `started` attribute due to a typo. This results in the `last_active` attribute not getting initialized properly.

### Strategy for fixing the bug
To fix the bug, we need to correct the assignment of the `last_active` parameter to the `last_active` attribute in the `__init__` function of the `Worker` class.

### The corrected version of the buggy function

```python
class Worker(object):
    """
    Structure for tracking worker activity and keeping their references.
    """

    def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
        self.id = worker_id
        self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
        self.last_active = last_active  # seconds since epoch
        self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        self.tasks = set()  # task objects
        self.info = {}
```
