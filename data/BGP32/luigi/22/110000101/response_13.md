### Analysis
The buggy function is the `__init__` method of the `Worker` class. It initializes the worker instance with the provided worker_id, last_active, and other default values.

The bug in the current implementation is that the `last_active` argument is not assigned to `self.last_active` correctly in the `__init__` method. Instead, the default value `None` is being assigned to `self.last_active`.

### Bug Explanation
The bug causes the `last_active` parameter value to be ignored, and the instance variable `self.last_active` retains the default value `None` instead of the provided `last_active` value.

### Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, the `last_active` parameter should be assigned to `self.last_active` without using the default value `None`. We need to ensure that the provided `last_active` value is correctly passed to the instance variable during object creation.

### Corrected Version
```python
class Worker(object):
    """
    Structure for tracking worker activity and keeping their references.
    """

    def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
        self.id = worker_id
        self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
        self.last_active = last_active if last_active is not None else time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        self.tasks = set()  # task objects
        self.info = {}
```

In the corrected version, we use a conditional expression to assign the `last_active` parameter to `self.last_active` only if `last_active` is not `None`. Otherwise, `time.time()` is used as the default value for `self.last_active`. This ensures that the provided `last_active` value is correctly used during object initialization.
