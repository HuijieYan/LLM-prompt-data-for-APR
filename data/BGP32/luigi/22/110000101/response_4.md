The bug in the provided function is caused by the incorrect assignment of the `last_active` parameter. The `last_active` parameter is supposed to store the time in seconds since epoch when the worker was last active, but it is being initialized with a default value of `None` instead of the specified value. This results in the incorrect initialization of the `self.last_active` attribute.

To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the `last_active` parameter is correctly assigned to the `self.last_active` attribute in the `__init__` method of the `Worker` class.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
class Worker(object):
    """
    Structure for tracking worker activity and keeping their references.
    """

    def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
        self.id = worker_id
        self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
        self.last_active = last_active if last_active is not None else time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        self.tasks = set()  # task objects
        self.info = {}
```

This corrected version initializes the `self.last_active` attribute with the provided `last_active` parameter if it is not `None`. Otherwise, it assigns the current time using `time.time()`. This ensures that the `self.last_active` attribute is correctly initialized with the expected timestamp value.
