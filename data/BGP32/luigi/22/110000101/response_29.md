### Analysis and Explanation
The buggy function `__init__` is responsible for initializing a Worker object. The bug in this function is that it incorrectly initializes the `last_active` attribute as `last_active=None` instead of the expected input value. This causes the `last_active` attribute to be set to `None` instead of the provided `last_active` value.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the `last_active` attribute is properly initialized with the provided input value if it is not `None`.

### Corrected Version

```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: luigi/scheduler.py

# The declaration of the class containing the buggy function
class Worker(object):
    """
    Structure for tracking worker activity and keeping their references.
    """

    # Corrected version of the buggy function
    def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
        self.id = worker_id
        self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
        if last_active is not None:
            self.last_active = last_active
        else:
            self.last_active = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        self.tasks = set()  # task objects
        self.info = {}
```
