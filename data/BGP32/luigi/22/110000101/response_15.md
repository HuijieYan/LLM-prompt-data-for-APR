### Analysis
The buggy function is the `__init__` constructor method of the `Worker` class. It is intended to initialize the Worker object with the provided worker_id and last_active time. The bug seems to be related to the assignment of the `last_active` parameter.

### Error location
The error is located in the line `self.last_active = last_active`. The `last_active` parameter is assigned directly without any error handling or conversion.

### Cause of the bug
The bug occurs because the `last_active` parameter is assigned directly to `self.last_active` without checking if it is provided or not. This can lead to unexpected behavior if `last_active` is None or not in the correct format.

### Bug fix strategy
1. Check if the `last_active` parameter is None.
2. If it is None, set `self.last_active` to None as well.
3. If it is not None, validate its type and assign it to `self.last_active`.

### Corrected version of the function
```python
class Worker(object):
    """
    Structure for tracking worker activity and keeping their references.
    """

    def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
        self.id = worker_id
        self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
        self.last_active = last_active if last_active is not None else None
        self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        self.tasks = set()  # task objects
        self.info = {}
```
