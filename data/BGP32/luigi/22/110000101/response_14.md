The bug in the provided code is that the `last_active` parameter is not being initialized properly in the `__init__` function of the Worker class. It is supposed to be initialized as the input `last_active` value if provided, otherwise `None`.

### Strategy for fixing the bug:
To fix this bug, we need to modify the initialization of the `last_active` attribute in the `__init__` function to use the input parameter `last_active` if it is provided, otherwise set it to `None`.

### Corrected version of the function:

```python
class Worker(object):
    """
    Structure for tracking worker activity and keeping their references.
    """

    def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
        self.id = worker_id
        self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
        self.last_active = last_active if last_active is not None else None  # seconds since epoch
        self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        self.tasks = set()  # task objects
        self.info = {}
```

With this correction, the `last_active` attribute will now be properly initialized based on the input values provided, either as the input `last_active` value or `None` if not provided. This fixed version of the function should now satisfy the expected input/output values for the given test case.
