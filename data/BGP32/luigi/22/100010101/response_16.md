## Analysis
The error message indicates that the `TypeError` is occurring because the `self.last_active` attribute is being used as `NoneType` in the expression `self.last_active + config.worker_disconnect_delay`. This implies that `last_active` was not being initialized correctly in the `__init__` function.

## Bug Cause
The bug is caused by the `last_active` parameter in the `__init__` function being set to `None`, leading to a `NoneType` error when trying to perform addition with an integer in the `prune` method.

## Fix Strategy
To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the `last_active` parameter is properly initialized in the `__init__` function, either with the provided value or with a default value. We can use a default value of `None` in the function signature and then conditionally set the attribute `self.last_active` in the `__init__` function.

## The corrected version of the function
```python
def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
    self.id = worker_id
    self.reference = None
    self.last_active = last_active if last_active is not None else time.time()
    self.started = time.time()
    self.tasks = set()
    self.info = {}
``` 

With this correction, the `last_active` parameter is correctly initialized in the `__init__` function, either with the provided value or the current time if no value is provided. This should resolve the `TypeError` issue identified in the failing test.
