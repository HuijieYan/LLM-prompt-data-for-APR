### Analysis
The error message indicates a `TypeError` when trying to add `NoneType` and `int` together. This occurs in the `prune` method when checking if a worker should be pruned based on the last active time.

### Bug
The bug originates from the `__init__` method where `last_active` is allowed to be `None`, causing issues when trying to calculate the worker's activity time in the `prune` method.

### Fix
We need to handle the case where `last_active` is `None` in the `prune` method to avoid the `TypeError`.

### Corrected Version
```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: luigi/scheduler.py

# corrected __init__ method
def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
    self.id = worker_id
    self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
    self.last_active = last_active  # seconds since epoch
    self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
    self.tasks = set()  # task objects
    self.info = {}

# corrected prune method
def prune(self, config):
    # Delete workers that haven't said anything for a while (probably killed)
    if self.last_active is not None and self.last_active + config.worker_disconnect_delay < time.time():
        # Prune the worker
        pass
``` 

By checking if `self.last_active` is not `None` before performing the calculation in the `prune` method, we avoid the `TypeError` and ensure that the comparison is valid.
