### Analysis
The error message indicates a `TypeError` caused by trying to add a `NoneType` and an `int` in the `prune` method of the `Worker` class. This is happening because in the `__init__` method of the `Worker` class, `last_active` is set to `None`, and in the `prune` method, it is trying to add this `None` value with an `int`.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix this bug, we need to ensure that if `last_active` is not provided during the initialization of the `Worker` object, it defaults to a value that can be added with an `int`.

### Corrected Version
```python
def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
    self.id = worker_id
    self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
    if last_active is None:
        self.last_active = time.time()  # set current time if last_active is not provided
    else:
        self.last_active = last_active
    self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
    self.tasks = set()  # task objects
    self.info = {}
``` 

By modifying the initialization logic as shown above, we ensure that `last_active` defaults to the current time if it is not explicitly provided, preventing the `NoneType` error in the `prune` method.
