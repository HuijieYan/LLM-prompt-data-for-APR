### Analysis
The error message indicates a `TypeError` when trying to add `NoneType` (self.last_active is None) and an `int` (config.worker_disconnect_delay) together in the `prune()` method. This occurs because `last_active` parameter has a default value of `None`, which causes the issue when trying to access its value without checking for `None`.

### Bug Cause
The bug is caused by not handling the case where `last_active` is `None` in the initialization of the Worker class. When `last_active` is `None`, attempting to add it to an integer value raises a `TypeError`.

### Fix
To fix the bug, we need to check if `last_active` is `None` before performing any operations on it. If it is `None`, we should assign a default value to `last_active`. 

### Corrected Version
```python
def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
    self.id = worker_id
    self.reference = None
    if last_active is not None:
        self.last_active = last_active
    else:
        self.last_active = time.time()
    self.started = time.time()
    self.tasks = set()
    self.info = {}
```
