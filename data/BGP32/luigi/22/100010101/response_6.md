### Analysis
- The bug occurs in the `__init__` function of the `Worker` class in the `luigi/scheduler.py` file.
- The error message indicates a `TypeError` when trying to add a `NoneType` and an `int` in the `prune` method of the `Worker` class.

### Bug Explanation
- The bug occurs because the `last_active` parameter in the `__init__` function is initialized as `None`.
- When the `prune` method is called, it tries to compare `self.last_active` (which is `None`) with an integer value from `config.worker_disconnect_delay`, resulting in the `TypeError`.

### Bug Fixing Strategy
- We need to handle the case where `last_active` is not provided during initialization and assign a default value to it.
- We can use the `time.time()` as a default value for `last_active` to ensure it's a valid timestamp.

### The corrected version of the buggy function
```python
# The corrected version of the buggy function
def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
    self.id = worker_id
    self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
    self.last_active = last_active if last_active is not None else time.time()  # seconds since epoch
    self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
    self.tasks = set()  # task objects
    self.info = {}
```
