## Analysis
The error message indicates that there is a `TypeError` when trying to add a `NoneType` and an `int` in the `prune` function. This error is caused by the `last_active` parameter being set to `None` in the `__init__` function, which results in `self.last_active` being `None` when trying to calculate `self.last_active + config.worker_disconnect_delay`.

## Fix
To fix this issue, we need to handle the case where `last_active` is `None` in the `__init__` function. We can set a default value for `last_active` if it is not provided.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
import time

def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
    self.id = worker_id
    self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
    self.last_active = last_active if last_active is not None else time.time()  # seconds since epoch
    self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
    self.tasks = set()  # task objects
    self.info = {}
```

By setting `self.last_active` to `time.time()` if `last_active` is `None`, we ensure that it always has a valid timestamp value. This will prevent the `TypeError` when trying to add it to another integer in the `prune` function.
