### Analysis
- The error message indicates that there is a `TypeError` when trying to add `NoneType` and `int` in the `prune` function.
- The error occurs because the `last_active` parameter can be `None` by default, which is causing the issue when trying to add it to an integer representing time.
  
### Bug Cause
- The bug is caused by the default `None` value for `last_active`, which leads to a `NoneType` being operated on with an `int`, causing the `TypeError`.

### Fix Strategy
- We need to handle the case where `last_active` is `None` before performing any operations with it in the `prune` method.

### Corrected Version
```python
# The corrected version of the __init__ function
def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
    self.id = worker_id
    self.reference = None
    self.last_active = last_active if last_active is not None else time.time()
    self.started = time.time()
    self.tasks = set()
    self.info = {}
```
