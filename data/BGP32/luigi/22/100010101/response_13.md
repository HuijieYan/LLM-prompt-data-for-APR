### Analysis
- The error message indicates that the `self.last_active` variable is of type `NoneType`, which is causing the TypeError when trying to add an integer to it.
- The expected input values include `worker_id` as an integer and `last_active` as a float, so the bug seems to be related to the initialization of the `last_active` variable.
- The `last_active` parameter is optional in the `__init__` method, so it defaults to `None` if not provided explicitly.

### Bug Cause
The bug occurs because the `last_active` parameter defaults to `None`, and when trying to add an integer value (`config.worker_disconnect_delay`) to `None`, it results in a TypeError.

### Fix Strategy
We need to handle the case where `last_active` is provided as `None` by setting a default value for it in the `__init__` method.

### Corrected Version
```python
def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
    self.id = worker_id
    self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
    self.last_active = last_active if last_active is not None else time.time()  # seconds since epoch or current time
    self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
    self.tasks = set()  # task objects
    self.info = {}
``` 

With this corrected version, we ensure that `last_active` will default to the current time if no value is provided, avoiding the TypeError when attempting to add an integer to `None`.
