The issue in the provided code is that the `last_active` parameter is set to `None` by default, which leads to a `TypeError` when trying to add an integer to a `NoneType`.

To fix this issue, we need to check if `last_active` is `None` before performing any operations on it.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
    self.id = worker_id
    self.reference = None
    self.last_active = last_active if last_active is not None else time.time()
    self.started = time.time()
    self.tasks = set()
    self.info = {}
```

By making this change, we ensure that if `last_active` is not provided, it defaults to the current time using `time.time()`. This will prevent the `TypeError` from occurring when trying to perform arithmetic operations on `None`.

This corrected version should now pass the failing test case.
