The bug in the provided function is due to the `last_active` parameter being set to `None` by default, leading to a `TypeError` when trying to add an integer value to `None` in the `prune` method.

To fix this bug, we can initialize `last_active` to the current time (in seconds since epoch) if it is not provided when calling the constructor. This way, `last_active` will always have a valid value and the addition operation in the `prune` method will work correctly.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
    self.id = worker_id
    self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
    if last_active is None:
        self.last_active = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
    else:
        self.last_active = last_active
    self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
    self.tasks = set()  # task objects
    self.info = {}
```

With this modification, the `last_active` attribute will always be initialized with a valid value, either the provided `last_active` parameter or the current time if `last_active` is `None`. This will prevent the `TypeError` mentioned in the failing test.
