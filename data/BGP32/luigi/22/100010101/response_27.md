### Analysis
The error message indicates that there is a `TypeError` when trying to add `NoneType` and `int` in the `prune` method. This error occurs when `last_active` is `None` and we try to add it to an integer in the condition check.

### Bug Fix Strategy
We need to ensure that `last_active` is initialized properly to a default value if `None` is provided as the argument. We can use the current time as the default value if `last_active` is not provided.

### The corrected version of the function
```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: luigi/scheduler.py

def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
    self.id = worker_id
    self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
    self.last_active = last_active if last_active is not None else time.time()  # seconds since epoch
    self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
    self.tasks = set()  # task objects
    self.info = {}
```
