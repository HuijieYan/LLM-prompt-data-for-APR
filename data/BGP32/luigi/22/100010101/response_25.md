The bug in the provided function is caused by the `last_active` parameter being set as `None` by default, which leads to a `NoneType` error when trying to add it to an `int` within the `prune` method.

To fix this bug, we can initialize `last_active` with the current time in seconds since epoch if it is not provided as an argument. This ensures that `last_active` is always a valid `float` value.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
    self.id = worker_id
    self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
    if last_active is None:
        last_active = time.time()  # initialize with current time in seconds since epoch if not provided
    self.last_active = last_active  # seconds since epoch
    self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
    self.tasks = set()  # task objects
    self.info = {}
```

With this correction, the function will now properly handle the case when `last_active` is not provided, preventing the `NoneType` error.
