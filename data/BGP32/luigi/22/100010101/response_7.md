### Bug Analysis
The error message "TypeError: unsupported operand type(s) for +: 'NoneType' and 'int'" indicates that the code is trying to add an integer to a variable that has a value of `None`. This occurs in the line `if self.last_active + config.worker_disconnect_delay < time.time():`.

The `last_active` variable is initialized as `None` in the `__init__` method, which causes this issue.

### Bug Fix
To fix this bug, we need to handle the case where `last_active` is `None` before performing the addition operation. We can set a default value for `last_active` in the `__init__` method to avoid this issue.

Here is the corrected version of the function:
```python
def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
    self.id = worker_id
    self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
    self.last_active = last_active if last_active is not None else time.time()  # seconds since epoch or current time
    self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
    self.tasks = set()  # task objects
    self.info = {}
```

With this modification, if `last_active` is not provided during initialization, it will default to the current time, preventing the `None` value from causing the TypeError.
