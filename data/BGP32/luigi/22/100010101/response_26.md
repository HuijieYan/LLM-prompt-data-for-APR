The bug in the provided function arises from the fact that the `last_active` parameter in the `__init__` method can have a default value of `None`, resulting in a `NoneType` value for `self.last_active`. This leads to a `TypeError` when trying to add an integer value to `None`.

To fix this bug, we can modify the calculation involving `last_active` to check if it is `None` before performing any arithmetic operations. If it is `None`, we can set `last_active` to `0`.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
    self.id = worker_id
    self.reference = None
    self.last_active = last_active if last_active is not None else 0
    self.started = time.time()
    self.tasks = set()
    self.info = {}
```

By using this corrected version, the function will properly handle the case where `last_active` is `None` and avoid the `TypeError` when performing arithmetic operations.
