### Analysis
The error message indicates a `TypeError` due to trying to add `NoneType` and `int` in the line `if self.last_active + config.worker_disconnect_delay < time.time():`. This error occurs because `self.last_active` is initialized as `None` in the `__init__` function.

### Bug
The bug is caused by the `last_active` parameter being assigned `None` when it should be initialized as a `float` value. This causes issues when trying to perform arithmetic operations with `None`.

### Fix
We need to ensure that `last_active` is properly initialized with a default value that is a float representing the time since epoch or a similar suitable value.

### Corrected Version
```python
import time

# The relative path of the buggy file: luigi/scheduler.py

# this is the corrected function
def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=time.time()):
    self.id = worker_id
    self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
    self.last_active = last_active  # seconds since epoch
    self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
    self.tasks = set()  # task objects
    self.info = {}
```
