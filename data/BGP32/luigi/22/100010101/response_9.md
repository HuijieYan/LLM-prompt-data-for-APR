### Analysis
The error message indicates a `TypeError` due to trying to perform addition on a `NoneType` and an `int`. The issue arises when trying to add `self.last_active` (which is initialized as `None`) and `config.worker_disconnect_delay` (an `int`).

### Bug Cause
The bug is caused by not handling the case when `last_active` is not provided during the initialization of the `Worker` object. Since the default value for `last_active` is `None`, attempting to add `None` and an integer in the `prune` method causes the `TypeError`.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug
To fix this bug, we need to handle the case where `last_active` is not provided during the initialization. We can set a default value for `last_active` in the `__init__` method, ensuring that it will always be initialized to a valid value.

### Corrected Version
```python
# The corrected version of the function
def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
    self.id = worker_id
    self.reference = None
    self.last_active = last_active if last_active is not None else time.time()  # setting default value if last_active is not provided
    self.started = time.time()
    self.tasks = set()
    self.info = {}
```

With this correction, the `Worker` object will initialize `last_active` to the current time if no value is provided, preventing the `TypeError` when calling the `prune` method.
