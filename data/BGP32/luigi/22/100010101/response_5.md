## Proposed Fix

### Analysis
The error message indicates a `TypeError` due to attempting to perform an addition operation between a `NoneType` and an `int`. This occurs in the `prune` method when checking if `self.last_active` plus the `worker_disconnect_delay` is less than the current time. 

### Error Cause
The `last_active` parameter in the `__init__` method is set to `None` by default, leading to the `self.last_active` being `None`. This causes the error when adding an integer value to `None`.

### Proposed Fix
To fix this issue, we need to ensure that `last_active` is initialized properly in the `__init__` method to avoid having it set as `None`.

### Corrected Version
```python
def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
    self.id = worker_id
    self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
    self.last_active = last_active if last_active is not None else time.time()  # seconds since epoch
    self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
    self.tasks = set()  # task objects
    self.info = {}
```

By checking if `last_active` is `None` in the `__init__` method and initializing it to the current time if it is `None`, we ensure that `self.last_active` always contains a valid timestamp.
