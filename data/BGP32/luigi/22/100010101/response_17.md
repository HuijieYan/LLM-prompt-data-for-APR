### Analysis
- The error message indicates a `TypeError` when trying to perform addition between a `NoneType` and an `int`.
- The `last_active` parameter is defaulted to `None` in the function signature.
- The error occurs when trying to calculate `self.last_active + config.worker_disconnect_delay`.
- To fix this bug, we need to handle the case where `last_active` is `None` before performing the addition operation.

### Fixing the Bug
We need to check if `last_active` is `None` before performing the addition. If it is `None`, we can consider it as equivalent to `0` or handle it in a way that makes sense for the use case. 

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
    self.id = worker_id
    self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
    
    if last_active is not None:
        self.last_active = last_active  # seconds since epoch
    else:
        self.last_active = 0
    
    self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
    self.tasks = set()  # task objects
    self.info = {}
``` 

This fix ensures that `self.last_active` is set to `0` if `last_active` is `None`, avoiding the `TypeError` when adding it to an `int` value. It allows the function to handle the default value correctly and pass the failing test case.
