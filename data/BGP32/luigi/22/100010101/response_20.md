### Fixing the bug
The bug is caused by the `last_active` variable being initialized as `None` in the `__init__` method, and when trying to perform arithmetic operation (`+`) with `None` and `int`, it raises a `TypeError`. To fix this bug, we need to handle the case when `last_active` is None and initialize it properly.

### Corrected version of the function
```python
def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
    self.id = worker_id
    self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
    if last_active is not None:
        self.last_active = last_active  # seconds since epoch
    else:
        self.last_active = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
    self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
    self.tasks = set()  # task objects
    self.info = {}
``` 

By modifying the initialization of `last_active`, we ensure that if it is not provided as an argument (i.e., it is `None`), then we initialize it with the current time using `time.time()`. This will prevent the `TypeError` when performing calculations with `last_active`.
