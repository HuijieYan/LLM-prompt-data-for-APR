The bug in the provided function is due to the `last_active` parameter being optional and defaulting to `None`. When trying to add `config.worker_disconnect_delay` to `self.last_active`, it raises a `TypeError` because you cannot add an integer to a `NoneType`.

To fix this bug, we need to handle the case where `last_active` is `None` properly.

Here is a corrected version of the function:

```python
def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
    self.id = worker_id
    self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
    self.last_active = last_active if last_active is not None else time.time()  # seconds since epoch
    self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
    self.tasks = set()  # task objects
    self.info = {}
```

By using a conditional expression `(last_active if last_active is not None else time.time())`, we set `self.last_active` to the provided value if it is not `None`, otherwise set it to the current time using `time.time()`.

This fix ensures that `self.last_active` will always have a valid value to prevent the `TypeError` when trying to add an integer value to it.

This corrected version should pass the failing test and satisfy the expected input/output values.
