### Strategy for fixing the bug
The error message indicates that there is an issue with adding a `NoneType` value (self.last_active) with an integer value (config.worker_disconnect_delay) using the addition operator `+`. To fix this bug, we need to ensure that `last_active` is initialized to a valid `float` value instead of `None`.

### The corrected version of the buggy function
```python
def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=0.0):
    self.id = worker_id
    self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
    self.last_active = last_active  # seconds since epoch
    self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
    self.tasks = set()  # task objects
    self.info = {}
```

By initializing `last_active` to `0.0` by default instead of `None`, we ensure that it is always a valid `float` value, which will prevent the `TypeError` when trying to add it with an integer. This correction should address the bug and the function should now pass the failing test case.
