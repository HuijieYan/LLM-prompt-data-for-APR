### Analysis
The error message indicates a `TypeError` due to an unsupported operand type in the expression `self.last_active + config.worker_disconnect_delay`. The expected behavior is to add an integer to a float value, but the `self.last_active` is set to `None` by default causing the error.

### Bug Cause
The bug is caused by `self.last_active` being set to `None` by default and then trying to add an integer value to it in the `prune()` method.

### Fix
We need to handle the case where `self.last_active` is `None` and set a default value if it is not provided during initialization.

### The corrected version
```python
import time

class Worker:
    def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
        self.id = worker_id
        self.reference = None
        self.last_active = last_active if last_active is not None else time.time()
        self.started = time.time()
        self.tasks = set()
        self.info = {}

    def prune(self, config):
        if self.last_active is not None and self.last_active + config.worker_disconnect_delay < time.time():
            # Clean up worker tasks or perform any necessary actions here
            pass
```
