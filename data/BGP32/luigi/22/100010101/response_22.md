### Analysis
The error message indicates a `TypeError` due to trying to add an integer to a `NoneType` object. This error occurs in the `prune` method when trying to compare `self.last_active + config.worker_disconnect_delay` with `time.time()`.

The buggy function `__init__` initializes the `last_active` parameter as `None`. This causes the error when the `prune` method is called because `self.last_active` is `None` and cannot be added to an integer.

### Solution
We need to initialize `self.last_active` with the provided `last_active` value if it's not `None`. If the `last_active` parameter is not provided, we can set it to `time.time()` initially.

### Corrected Version
```python
def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
    self.id = worker_id
    self.reference = None
    if last_active is not None:
        self.last_active = last_active
    else:
        self.last_active = time.time()
    self.started = time.time()
    self.tasks = set()
    self.info = {}
``` 

By making this adjustment, we ensure that `self.last_active` is initialized correctly to avoid the `TypeError` when comparing it in the `prune` method.
