### Analysis
The error message indicates a `TypeError: unsupported operand type(s) for +: 'NoneType' and 'int'`. This error indicates that `self.last_active` is `None`, and when trying to add `config.worker_disconnect_delay` to it, Python cannot perform the addition operation between a `NoneType` and `int`.

### Bug
The buggy function `__init__` defines the `last_active` parameter with a default value of `None`. This default value is causing the issue when trying to prune workers later on.

### Fix
We need to check if `last_active` is `None` before using it in the `prune` function. If it is `None`, we should set it to the current time.

### The corrected version
```python
def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
    self.id = worker_id
    self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
    if last_active is not None:
        self.last_active = last_active
    else:
        self.last_active = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
    self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
    self.tasks = set()  # task objects
    self.info = {}
```
