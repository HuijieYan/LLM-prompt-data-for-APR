### Analysis
The error message indicates a `TypeError` related to unsupported operand types in the line where `self.last_active + config.worker_disconnect_delay < time.time()` is being evaluated. The issue stems from `self.last_active` being initialized as `None` and attempting to add an integer value (`config.worker_disconnect_delay`) to it.

### Bug cause
The bug arises from the fact that `last_active` parameter in the `__init__` function, if not provided by the user, defaults to `None`. When the `prune` method is called, it tries to compare `None + config.worker_disconnect_delay` with an integer, resulting in a `TypeError`.

### Fix strategy
We need to ensure that if `last_active` is not specified during the initialization, it should default to a valid timestamp (such as the current time) rather than `None`. This requires updating the initialization logic to handle the case where `last_active` is not provided.

### Corrected code
```python
def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
    self.id = worker_id
    self.reference = None
    self.last_active = last_active if last_active is not None else time.time()  # Ensure last_active defaults to current time if None
    self.started = time.time()
    self.tasks = set()
    self.info = {}
``` 

By modifying the initialization logic for `last_active`, we ensure that it defaults to the current time if not specified by the user. This change addresses the issue of adding `None` to an integer in the `prune` method.
