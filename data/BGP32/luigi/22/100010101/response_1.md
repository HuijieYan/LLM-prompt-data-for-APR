The issue in the buggy function is that the `last_active` parameter is set to `None` by default, leading to a `TypeError` when trying to perform addition with it.

To fix this issue, we can initialize `self.last_active` to the current time in seconds since epoch if no value is provided for `last_active`.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
    self.id = worker_id
    self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
    if last_active is not None:
        self.last_active = last_active  # seconds since epoch
    else:
        self.last_active = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
    self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
    self.tasks = set()  # task objects
    self.info = {}
```

This correction ensures that if `last_active` is not provided, it defaults to the current time in seconds since epoch, preventing the `TypeError` when trying to add an integer to `None`.
