The bug in the provided function is due to the `last_active` parameter being set to `None` by default. This causes a `TypeError` when trying to add a numerical value to `None`.

To fix this bug, we need to handle the case where `last_active` is `None` and initialize it to a default value instead.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
    self.id = worker_id
    self.reference = None
    if last_active is not None:
        self.last_active = last_active
    else:
        self.last_active = time.time()
    self.started = time.time()
    self.tasks = set()
    self.info = {}
```

This fix checks if the `last_active` parameter is `None`. If it is not `None`, it uses the provided value. Otherwise, it initializes `last_active` to the current time using `time.time()`.

This corrected version should now pass the failing test case provided.
