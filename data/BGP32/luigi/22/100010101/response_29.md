### Analysis
The error message indicates that the `self.last_active` variable has a type mismatch when trying to add an integer value to it. The error occurs because the `last_active` parameter in the `__init__` function is set to `None` by default, and when trying to perform arithmetic operations with it, a `TypeError` is raised.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix this bug, we need to ensure that if `last_active` is not provided as an argument when initializing the Worker object, it should default to the current time (seconds since epoch) instead of `None`.

### The corrected version of the function

```python
def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
    self.id = worker_id
    self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
    self.last_active = last_active if last_active is not None else time.time()  # seconds since epoch
    self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
    self.tasks = set()  # task objects
    self.info = {}
``` 

By making this change, the `last_active` parameter will default to the current time if not provided, avoiding the `TypeError` when trying to add an integer value to `None`.
