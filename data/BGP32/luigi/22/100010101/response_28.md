### Analysis
1. The error message indicates a `TypeError` when trying to add `NoneType` and `int` in the `prune` function.
2. The `last_active` parameter in the `__init__` function is set as `None` by default.
3. The error occurs when trying to calculate `self.last_active + config.worker_disconnect_delay` in the `prune` function, where `self.last_active` is `None`.
4. To fix the bug, we need to handle the case where `self.last_active` is `None` and convert it to a valid `float` value before performing the addition.

### Fixing the Bug
To fix this bug, we need to update the `__init__` function to handle the case where `last_active` is `None` by setting it to the current time when `None` is provided. This will ensure that `self.last_active` always has a valid `float` value.
Additionally, you can add a check in the `prune` function to handle the case when `self.last_active` is `None` before performing the addition.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
    self.id = worker_id
    self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
    self.last_active = last_active if last_active is not None else time.time()  # seconds since epoch
    self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
    self.tasks = set()  # task objects
    self.info = {}

def prune(self, config):
    if self.last_active is not None: # Check if last_active is not None
        if self.last_active + config.worker_disconnect_delay < time.time():
            # Perform pruning operation
            pass
``` 

By ensuring that `self.last_active` is always a valid `float` value in the `__init__` function, we prevent the `TypeError` when adding it to an `int` in the `prune` function.
