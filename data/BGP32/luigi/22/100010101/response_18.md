### Analysis
The error message indicates that the addition operation is being performed between a `NoneType` and an `int`, causing a `TypeError`. The issue is with the initialization of the `last_active` variable in the `__init__` function. It is set to `None`, which is causing the error when attempting to add `worker_disconnect_delay` to it.

### Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that `last_active` is properly initialized with a default value if not provided. We can set it to `time.time()` if no value is provided. This will ensure that `last_active` is always a valid timestamp from the instantiation of the `Worker` object.

### Corrected Version
```python
def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
    self.id = worker_id
    self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
    self.last_active = last_active if last_active is not None else time.time()  # seconds since epoch or current time
    self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
    self.tasks = set()  # task objects
    self.info = {}
```
