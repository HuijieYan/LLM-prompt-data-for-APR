### Analysis
The error occurs because `self.last_active` is initialized as `None`, and when trying to perform an arithmetic operation with it in the `prune` method, a `TypeError` is raised due to the unsupported operand types ('NoneType' and 'int').

### Bug Cause
The bug is caused by `self.last_active` being assigned `None` in the constructor, which leads to the error when trying to add an integer (config.worker_disconnect_delay) to `None`.

### Fix
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that `self.last_active` is always initialized as an integer (representing seconds since epoch) instead of `None`.

### Corrected Version
```python
import time

class Worker(object):
    """
    Structure for tracking worker activity and keeping their references.
    """

    def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=0):  # Default to 0 instead of None
        self.id = worker_id
        self.reference = None
        self.last_active = last_active
        self.started = time.time()
        self.tasks = set()
        self.info = {}
    
    def prune(self, config):
        if self.last_active + config.worker_disconnect_delay < time.time():
            pass  # Add logic here for pruning workers
``` 

By initializing `last_active` to 0 instead of `None`, the bug is fixed as now it is guaranteed to be an integer, avoiding the `TypeError` when performing the arithmetic operation in the `prune` method.
