### Explanation
The error occurs in the `prune` method of the `Worker` class when trying to compare `self.last_active` with `config.worker_disconnect_delay`. The error message indicates that the operand types for the `+` operator are 'NoneType' and 'int', which means `self.last_active` is currently set to `None`.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that `self.last_active` is properly initialized in the `__init__` method of the `Worker` class with a default value that can be used in arithmetic operations later.

### Corrected Version

```python
class Worker(object):
    """
    Structure for tracking worker activity and keeping their references.
    """
    
    def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
        self.id = worker_id
        self.reference = None
        self.last_active = last_active if last_active is not None else time.time()
        self.started = time.time()
        self.tasks = set()
        self.info = {}
    
    def prune(self, config):
        if self.last_active + config.worker_disconnect_delay < time.time():
            # Perform pruning operations here
            pass
``` 

With this correction, if `last_active` is not provided during the creation of a `Worker` instance, it will default to the current time when the instance is created. This ensures that there are no `NoneType` errors during the arithmetic operation in the `prune` method.
