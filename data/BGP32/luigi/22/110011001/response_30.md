### Analysis
- The error occurs in the `prune` function of the `Worker` class due to the `self.last_active` being `None` and trying to add an integer value to it.
- The `last_active` parameter in the `__init__` function is set to `None` by default.
- The `prune` function expects `last_active` to be a valid timestamp (seconds since epoch) and adds `worker_disconnect_delay` to it.

### Bug Cause
The bug occurs because `self.last_active` is initialized as `None`, and when trying to add an integer (`worker_disconnect_delay`) to `None`, a `TypeError` is raised.

### Fix Strategy
We need to ensure that `last_active` is properly initialized to a timestamp, either by providing a default value in the constructor or handling `None` cases in the `prune` function.

### Corrected Version
```python
class Worker(object):
    """
    Structure for tracking worker activity and keeping their references.
    """

    def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
        self.id = worker_id
        self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
        self.last_active = last_active if last_active is not None else time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        self.tasks = set()  # task objects
        self.info = {}

    def prune(self, config):
        # Delete workers that haven't said anything for a while (probably killed)
        if self.last_active + config.worker_disconnect_delay < time.time():
            # Perform prune operation
            pass
``` 

By modifying the initialization of `last_active` in the constructor to set it to the current time if it's `None`, we ensure that valid timestamps are used when pruning workers. This should resolve the `TypeError` and make the function work correctly.
