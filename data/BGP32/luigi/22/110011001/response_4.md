### Analysis
The error occurs in the `prune` method due to the `last_active` variable being initialized as `None` in the `__init__` method. This causes a `TypeError` when trying to add `NoneType` with an `int` in the `prune` method.

### Bug Cause
The bug is caused by not assigning a default value to `last_active` in the `__init__` method, leading to it being `None` when trying to calculate `self.last_active + config.worker_disconnect_delay` in the `prune` method.

### Fix
Assign a default value of `0` to `last_active` in the `__init__` method to prevent it from being `None`.
```python
class Worker(object):
    def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=0):
        self.id = worker_id
        self.reference = None
        self.last_active = last_active
        self.started = time.time()
        self.tasks = set()
        self.info = {}
```

By adding `last_active=0` as a default value, we ensure that `last_active` is always an integer, preventing the `TypeError` during calculations in the `prune` method.
