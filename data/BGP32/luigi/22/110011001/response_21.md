### Analysis
The error occurs when trying to add `self.last_active` (which is initially set to `None`) to an integer in the prune method of the Worker class. This results in a TypeError because `None` cannot be added to an integer.

### Bug Cause
The bug is caused by the `last_active` parameter being set to `None` initially. When trying to calculate if a worker should be pruned based on the last active time plus a delay, adding `None` to an integer causes the TypeError.

### Fix
To fix the bug, we need to handle the case where `last_active` is `None` in the `prune` method. One way to do this is to set a default value for `last_active` to the current time in the `__init__` method if no value is provided.

### Corrected Version
```python
class Worker(object):
    """
    Structure for tracking worker activity and keeping their references.
    """

    def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
        self.id = worker_id
        self.reference = None
        self.last_active = last_active if last_active is not None else time.time()
        self.started = time.time()
        self.tasks = set()
        self.info = {}

    def prune(self, config):
        if self.last_active is not None and self.last_active + config.worker_disconnect_delay < time.time():
            # Perform the pruning operation here
            pass
```
