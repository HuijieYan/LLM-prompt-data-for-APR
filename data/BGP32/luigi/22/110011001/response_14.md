### Analysis:
1. The error occurs at the line `if self.last_active + config.worker_disconnect_delay < time.time():` due to trying to add `None` (from `self.last_active`) with an integer value (`config.worker_disconnect_delay`).
2. The bug stems from `self.last_active` being initialized as `None` in the `__init__` method.
3. The error message clearly states that it's a `TypeError` caused by trying to operate on a `NoneType` and an integer.
4. To fix the bug, we need to handle the case where `self.last_active` may be `None` when checking for pruning.

### Bug Fix:
```python
class Worker(object):
    """
    Structure for tracking worker activity and keeping their references.
    """

    def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
        self.id = worker_id
        self.reference = None
        self.last_active = last_active
        self.started = time.time()
        self.tasks = set()
        self.info = {}

    def prune(self, config):
        # Delete workers that haven't said anything for a while (probably killed)
        if self.last_active is not None and self.last_active + config.worker_disconnect_delay < time.time():
            # Perform prune operation or any other action needed
            pass
```

This fix includes checking if `self.last_active` is not `None` before trying to perform arithmetic operations on it. This way, we avoid the `TypeError` when `self.last_active` is `None`.
