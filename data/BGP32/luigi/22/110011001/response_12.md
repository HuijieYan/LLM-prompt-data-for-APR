### Potential locations of the bug
The bug seems to be related to the `self.last_active` attribute being initialized as `None` in the `__init__` function of the `Worker` class. This causes an issue when trying to perform addition operations with `None` and an integer in the `prune` method. 

### Cause of the bug
The bug occurs because `self.last_active` is initially set to `None` in the `__init__` function, and when trying to compare it with `config.worker_disconnect_delay` in the `prune` method, it raises a `TypeError` due to the unsupported operand types for addition.

### Strategy for fixing the bug
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that `self.last_active` is assigned a valid value in the `__init__` function. It should be initialized as `time.time()` when no value is provided. This way, the attribute will always have a valid type (`float`) when performing arithmetic operations.

### Corrected version of the buggy function
```python
class Worker(object):
    """
    Structure for tracking worker activity and keeping their references.
    """

    def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
        self.id = worker_id
        self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
        self.last_active = last_active if last_active is not None else time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        self.tasks = set()  # task objects
        self.info = {}

    def prune(self, config):
        # Delete workers that haven't said anything for a while (probably killed)
        if self.last_active + config.worker_disconnect_delay < time.time():
            # Perform pruning operation here, if necessary
            pass
```

By initializing `self.last_active` to `time.time()` when no value is provided, we ensure that it always has a valid `float` type, resolving the `TypeError` encountered during the addition operation.
