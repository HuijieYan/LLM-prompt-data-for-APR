### Analysis
The error occurs in the `prune` method of the `Worker` class when trying to compare `self.last_active` (which can be `None`) with an integer value (config.worker_disconnect_delay + time.time()). This type mismatch causes a `TypeError`.

### Bug Cause
The bug is caused by the `last_active` parameter being set as `None` initially, and later used in the `prune` method without proper handling for this case.

### Fix Strategy
We need to handle the case where `last_active` is `None` in the `prune` method by setting a default value if `last_active` is `None`.

### Corrected Version
```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: luigi/scheduler.py

# The declaration of the class containing the corrected function
class Worker(object):
    """
    Structure for tracking worker activity and keeping their references.
    """

    def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
        self.id = worker_id
        self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
        self.last_active = last_active if last_active is not None else time.time()  # seconds since epoch or current time if last_active is None
        self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        self.tasks = set()  # task objects
        self.info = {}

    def prune(self, config):
        # Delete workers that haven't said anything for a while (probably killed)
        if self.last_active + config.worker_disconnect_delay < time.time() if self.last_active is not None else 0:
            # Perform the pruning operation, for example:
            print("Pruned inactive worker:", self.id)
```

By setting a default value based on the current time when `last_active` is `None`, the code avoids the `TypeError` that was occurring in the previous buggy version.
