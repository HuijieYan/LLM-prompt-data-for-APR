### Analysis
The error occurs in the `prune` method of the `Worker` class when trying to compare `self.last_active` (which can be `None`) with an integer value (`config.worker_disconnect_delay`). The error message indicates a `TypeError` due to unsupported operand types for addition.

### Bug Cause
The bug is caused by `self.last_active` being initialized as `None` in the `__init__` method, and then used in the `prune` method without proper handling for the case when it is `None`.

### Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to handle the case where `self.last_active` is `None` in the `prune` method. We can either choose a default value for `last_active` in the `__init__` method or add a conditional check in the `prune` method to handle the `None` case before performing addition.

### Corrected Version
```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: luigi/scheduler.py

# The declaration of the class containing the buggy function
class Worker(object):
    """
    Structure for tracking worker activity and keeping their references.
    """

    def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
        self.id = worker_id
        self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
        self.last_active = last_active  # seconds since epoch or None
        self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        self.tasks = set()  # task objects
        self.info = {}
        
    def prune(self, config):
        # Delete workers that haven't said anything for a while (probably killed)
        if self.last_active is not None and self.last_active + config.worker_disconnect_delay < time.time():
            # prune logic
            pass
```

In the corrected version, I included a conditional check in the `prune` method to ensure that `self.last_active` is not `None` before trying to perform addition. This modification will prevent the `TypeError` that occurred in the buggy function.
