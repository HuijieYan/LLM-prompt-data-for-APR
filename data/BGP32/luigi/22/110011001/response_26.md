### Analysis
The bug arises from the fact that the `last_active` parameter defaults to `None` if not provided when initializing a `Worker` object. This leads to a `TypeError` when trying to use `None` in an arithmetic operation.

### Bug Cause
The bug occurs because `self.last_active` is `None`, and when trying to perform the operation `self.last_active + config.worker_disconnect_delay`, Python raises a `TypeError` due to trying to add `None` (NoneType) to an integer.

### Fix
To fix the bug, we need to handle the case where `last_active` is `None` during the operation by providing a default value. One approach is to initialize `self.last_active` to the current time if no value is provided.

### Corrected Version
```python
class Worker(object):
    """
    Structure for tracking worker activity and keeping their references.
    """

    def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
        self.id = worker_id
        self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
        self.last_active = last_active if last_active is not None else time.time()  # seconds since epoch or current time
        self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        self.tasks = set()  # task objects
        self.info = {}
```
