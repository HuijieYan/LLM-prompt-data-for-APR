### Analysis
The error occurs in the `prune` method of the `Worker` class when trying to calculate the expiration time based on the `last_active` time and the `worker_disconnect_delay` from the config. The issue is that `last_active` is initialized as `None` in the `__init__` method, causing a `TypeError` when trying to add an integer to `None`.

### Bug Cause
The bug is caused by the `last_active` variable being initialized as `None` in the `__init__` method of the `Worker` class. When the `prune` method tries to calculate the expiration time, it encounters an unsupported operand type error due to trying to add an integer to `None`.

### Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, initialize `last_active` with the current time (converted to seconds since epoch) instead of `None` in the `__init__` method. This ensures that `last_active` is always a valid timestamp when the `Worker` object is created.

### Corrected Version
```python
import time

# The relative path of the buggy file: luigi/scheduler.py

# The declaration of the class containing the buggy function
class Worker(object):
    """
    Structure for tracking worker activity and keeping their references.
    """

    def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
        self.id = worker_id
        self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
        self.last_active = last_active if last_active is not None else time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        self.tasks = set()  # task objects
        self.info = {}

    def prune(self, config):
        # Delete workers that haven't said anything for a while (probably killed)
        if self.last_active + config.worker_disconnect_delay < time.time():
            # prune the worker
            pass
```

By initializing `last_active` with the current time when it is not provided during object creation, the bug is fixed, and the `prune` method should now work correctly without encountering the `TypeError`.
