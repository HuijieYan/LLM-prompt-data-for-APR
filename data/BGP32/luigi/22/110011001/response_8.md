### Analysis
The error occurs in the `prune()` method of the `Worker` class. The issue stems from `self.last_active` being initialized as `None` in the `__init__` method. When trying to compare `None` with an integer in the `prune()` method, a `TypeError` is raised.

### Bug Cause
The `self.last_active` variable is initialized as `None` in the constructor, and it is later used in the `prune()` method without first checking if it is not `None`. This causes the `TypeError` when trying to add an integer to `None`.

### Fix Strategy
Ensure that `self.last_active` is a valid integer before performing any arithmetic operations with it in the `prune()` method.

### Corrected Version
Below is the corrected version of the `Worker` class with a modification to check if `self.last_active` is not `None` before comparison in the `prune()` method.

```python
class Worker(object):
    """
    Structure for tracking worker activity and keeping their references.
    """

    def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
        self.id = worker_id
        self.reference = None
        self.last_active = last_active
        self.started = time.time()
        self.tasks = set()
        self.info = {}

    def prune(self, config):
        if self.last_active is not None and self.last_active + config.worker_disconnect_delay < time.time():
            # Perform pruning operation
            pass
``` 

This corrected version avoids the `TypeError` by checking if `self.last_active` is not `None` before trying to add the delay time in the `prune()` method.
