### Analysis
The error message indicates that there is a `TypeError` because the `last_active` attribute of the `Worker` instance is of type `None`, and the code is trying to add an integer to it, which is not supported.

### Bug Cause
The `last_active` attribute is initialized with a default value of `None` in the `__init__` function of the `Worker` class. When the `prune` method is called on a `Worker` instance, it tries to add an integer value (config.worker_disconnect_delay) to `None`, causing the `TypeError`.

### Fix Strategy
We need to handle the case where `last_active` is `None` and provide a default value to perform the addition operation without error.

### Corrected Version
```python
class Worker(object):
    """
    Structure for tracking worker activity and keeping their references.
    """

    def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
        self.id = worker_id
        self.reference = None
        self.last_active = last_active if last_active is not None else time.time()  # Ensure last_active is not None
        self.started = time.time()
        self.tasks = set()
        self.info = {}

    def prune(self, config):
        if self.last_active is not None and self.last_active + config.worker_disconnect_delay < time.time():  # Check if last_active is not None
            # Perform pruning operation
``` 

After applying this correction, the `prune` method will check if `last_active` is not `None` before attempting the addition operation with `config.worker_disconnect_delay`. This change should prevent the `TypeError` and make the test pass successfully.
