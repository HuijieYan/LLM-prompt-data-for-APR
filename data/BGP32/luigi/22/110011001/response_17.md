### Analysis
- The error occurs in the `prune` method of the `Worker` class.
- The error message indicates a `TypeError` due to trying to perform addition between a `NoneType` and an `int`.
- The `last_active` attribute is initialized with a default value of `None` in the `__init__` method of the `Worker` class.
- The problem arises when trying to calculate `self.last_active + config.worker_disconnect_delay`.

### Bug Cause
The bug occurs because `self.last_active` is initially set to `None` in the `__init__` method, and when trying to add `config.worker_disconnect_delay` to it, a `NoneType` and an `int` are incompatible for addition.

### Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that `self.last_active` is properly initialized in a way that allows addition with an integer value.

### Corrected Version
```python
class Worker(object):
    """
    Structure for tracking worker activity and keeping their references.
    """

    def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
        self.id = worker_id
        self.reference = None
        self.last_active = last_active if last_active is not None else time.time()  # Ensure last_active is set to current time if None
        self.started = time.time()
        self.tasks = set()
        self.info = {}

    def prune(self, config):
        if self.last_active + config.worker_disconnect_delay < time.time():
            # Implement the pruning logic here
            pass
```  

By checking if `last_active` is `None`, and setting it to `time.time()` if it is, we ensure that `self.last_active` is always initialized with a valid numeric value, allowing addition with `config.worker_disconnect_delay` without raising a `TypeError`.
