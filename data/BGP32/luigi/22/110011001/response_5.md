### 3. Explanation of the Bug

The error message indicates a `TypeError` in the `prune` method of the `Worker` class in the `luigi/scheduler.py` file. The specific issue is with the line `if self.last_active + config.worker_disconnect_delay < time.time():`, where the operand types for the `+` operation are incompatible (`NoneType` and `int`).

Looking at the `__init__` method of the `Worker` class, we see that the `last_active` attribute is set to `None` by default if no value is provided during initialization. This default value of `None` causes the issue because when trying to add `config.worker_disconnect_delay` (an `int`) to it in the `prune` method, it results in a `TypeError`.

### 4. Suggested Fix Strategy

To fix this bug, we need to handle the case where `last_active` is `None` in the `prune` method. One approach is to set a default time value for `last_active` in the `__init__` method if it is not provided during initialization, making sure to handle the time calculations correctly in the `prune` method.

### Corrected Version of the `Worker` Class

Here is the corrected version of the `Worker` class with the bug fixed:

```python
class Worker(object):
    """
    Structure for tracking worker activity and keeping their references.
    """

    def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
        self.id = worker_id
        self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
        self.last_active = last_active if last_active is not None else time.time()  # seconds since epoch or current time
        self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        self.tasks = set()  # task objects
        self.info = {}    
    
    def prune(self, config):
        if self.last_active is None:
            return False  # Handle the case where last_active is None

        if self.last_active + config.worker_disconnect_delay < time.time():
            # Prune the worker
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

With this correction, the `prune` method now handles the case where `last_active` is `None` and performs correct time calculations to avoid the `TypeError` encountered in the buggy version.
