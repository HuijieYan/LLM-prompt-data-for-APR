### Explanation:
The error message indicates a `TypeError` raised during the `prune` method due to unsupported operand types for the addition operation (`NoneType` and `int`). Specifically, the issue is within the comparison `self.last_active + config.worker_disconnect_delay < time.time()`.

In the `__init__` method, the `last_active` parameter is set to `None` if not provided, leading to the `TypeError` when trying to add `None` to an integer value (`config.worker_disconnect_delay`).

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to handle the case where `last_active` is `None` properly in the `prune` method by providing a default value if it's `None`.

### Corrected Version:

```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: luigi/scheduler.py

# The declaration of the class containing the corrected function
class Worker(object):
    """
    Structure for tracking worker activity and keeping their references.
    """

    def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
        self.id = worker_id
        self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
        self.last_active = last_active if last_active is not None else time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        self.tasks = set()  # task objects
        self.info = {}

    def prune(self, config):
        # Delete workers that haven't said anything for a while (probably killed)
        if self.last_active + config.worker_disconnect_delay < time.time():
            # Pruning logic here
```

By using `self.last_active if last_active is not None else time.time()` when initializing `last_active`, we ensure that a default value based on the current time is used when `last_active` is not provided. This modification should resolve the `TypeError` and allow the `prune` method to execute without issues.
