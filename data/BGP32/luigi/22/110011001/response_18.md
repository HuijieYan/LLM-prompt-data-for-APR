### Analysis:
1. The error occurs when trying to add `self.last_active` (which is initially set to `None`) to an integer (`config.worker_disconnect_delay`). This causes a `TypeError` because Python doesn't support adding `NoneType` and `int` directly.
   
2. In the `__init__` method of the `Worker` class, `last_active` is given a default value of `None`, which is causing the issue when used in the `prune` method.

### Fix:
Initialize `self.last_active` with the current time in seconds since epoch if it is not provided during the initialization. This way, it will always be an integer and can be safely used in calculations.

### Corrected version of the function:

```python
# The corrected version of the buggy function
class Worker(object):

    def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
        self.id = worker_id
        self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
        self.last_active = time.time() if last_active is None else last_active  # seconds since epoch or current time
        self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        self.tasks = set()  # task objects
        self.info = {}

    def prune(self, config):
        if self.last_active + config.worker_disconnect_delay < time.time():
            # prune worker logic here
            pass
```

This modification ensures that `self.last_active` is always an integer value at runtime, fixing the `TypeError` that occurred in the buggy version.
