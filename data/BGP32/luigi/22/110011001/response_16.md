### Analysis
The error occurs in the `prune` method of the `Worker` class due to the `last_active` attribute being initialized as `None` in the constructor. When trying to calculate `self.last_active + config.worker_disconnect_delay`, the addition operation is invalid because `None` cannot be added to an integer.

### Bug Location
The bug is located in the constructor `__init__` of the `Worker` class where `last_active` is initialized as `None`.

### Cause of the Bug
The bug arises from the fact that `last_active` is initialized as `None`, causing an unsupported operation error when trying to add an integer to `None` in the `prune` method.

### Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that `last_active` is always initialized with a valid timestamp instead of `None`.

### The corrected version of the buggy function
```python
class Worker(object):
    """
    Structure for tracking worker activity and keeping their references.
    """

    def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
        self.id = worker_id
        self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
        self.last_active = last_active if last_active is not None else time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        self.tasks = set()  # task objects
        self.info = {}
```

By modifying the initialization of `last_active` to default to `time.time()` if `None` is passed, we ensure that `last_active` always contains a valid timestamp. This prevents the TypeError during addition operations in the `prune` method.
