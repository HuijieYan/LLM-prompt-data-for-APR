### Bug Analysis
The bug occurs in the `prune` method of the `Worker` class. The error message indicates that the `self.last_active` attribute is of type `NoneType`, and the code tries to add the `config.worker_disconnect_delay` (which is an `int`) to it, resulting in a `TypeError`.

### Bug Explanation
The `last_active` attribute in the `__init__` method of the `Worker` class is set to `None` by default if no value is provided. When the `prune` method is called and tries to compare `self.last_active` (None) with `time.time()` (an integer), the addition operation fails due to the incompatible types.

### Bug Fix
To fix the bug, you can modify the `__init__` method to handle the case where `last_active` is not provided, initialize it with `time.time()` when it is `None`. This way, it will always have a valid value for comparison in the `prune` method.

### Corrected Version
```python
class Worker(object):
    """
    Structure for tracking worker activity and keeping their references.
    """

    def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
        self.id = worker_id
        self.reference = None
        if last_active is None:
            self.last_active = time.time()  # Initialize with current time if not provided
        else:
            self.last_active = last_active
        self.started = time.time()
        self.tasks = set()
        self.info = {}

    def prune(self, config):
        if self.last_active + config.worker_disconnect_delay < time.time():
            # Do something here
            pass
``` 

By initializing `last_active` with the current time if not provided in the `__init__` method, the bug should be fixed, and the `prune` method should work correctly without raising a `TypeError`.
