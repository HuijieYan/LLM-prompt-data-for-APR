### Potential Error Location
The error in the buggy function is likely occurring in the comparison `self.last_active + config.worker_disconnect_delay < time.time()` where `self.last_active` is `NoneType` and cannot be added with an `int` value.

### Cause of the Bug
The bug is caused by `self.last_active` being initialized as `None` and then being used in a mathematical operation with an integer (`config.worker_disconnect_delay`). This leads to a `TypeError` indicating that the addition operation is not supported between a `NoneType` and an `int`.

### Suggested Fix
To fix the bug, you should check if `self.last_active` is `None` before performing the addition operation. If it is `None`, consider treating it differently in the logic of the `prune` method.

### Corrected Version of the Function
```python
class Worker(object):
    """
    Structure for tracking worker activity and keeping their references.
    """
    
    def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
        self.id = worker_id
        self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
        self.last_active = last_active  # seconds since epoch
        self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        self.tasks = set()  # task objects
        self.info = {}
        
    def prune(self, config):
        # Delete workers that haven't said anything for a while (probably killed)
        if self.last_active is not None and self.last_active + config.worker_disconnect_delay < time.time():
            # Perform pruning logic here
            pass
``` 

With this correction, the `prune` method will now check if `self.last_active` is not `None` before trying to perform the addition operation, avoiding the `TypeError` that was previously encountered.
