### Analysis
The error occurs in the `prune` method of the `Worker` class. The `last_active` attribute is set to `None` by default in the constructor, causing a `NoneType` error when trying to add an integer value to it in the `prune` method.

### Bug Cause
The bug stems from the fact that `last_active` is initialized as `None` and then used in an addition operation with an integer in the `prune` method, resulting in a `NoneType` error.

### Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to check if `last_active` is `None` before performing the addition operation with the `config.worker_disconnect_delay`.

### Corrected Version
```python
class Worker(object):
    """
    Structure for tracking worker activity and keeping their references.
    """
    def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
        self.id = worker_id
        self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
        self.last_active = last_active  # seconds since epoch
        self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        self.tasks = set()  # task objects
        self.info = {}
        
    def prune(self, config):
        # Delete workers that haven't said anything for a while (probably killed)
        if self.last_active is not None and self.last_active + config.worker_disconnect_delay < time.time():
            # Perform pruning operation here
            pass
``` 

This corrected version ensures that the `last_active` attribute is not `None` before adding the value of `config.worker_disconnect_delay` to it in the `prune` method.
