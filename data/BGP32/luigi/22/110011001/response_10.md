### Analyzing the buggy function and error message
The `Worker` class has an `__init__` method that initializes worker objects. The error occurs when trying to call the `prune` method on a worker object. The error message indicates that there is a `TypeError` because the operation of adding an integer to `None` is unsupported.

### Identifying the bug
The bug occurs in the line:
```python
if self.last_active + config.worker_disconnect_delay < time.time():
```
The `self.last_active` attribute is `None`, leading to the error when trying to add an integer to `None`.

### Cause of the bug
The `self.last_active` is initialized to `None` in the `__init__` method of the `Worker` class. The comparison operation in the `prune` method fails because it's trying to add an integer to `None`.

### Fixing the bug
We need to handle the case where `self.last_active` is `None` in the `prune` method. One approach is to check if `self.last_active` is `None` before performing the comparison. If it is `None`, consider the worker active by using the `self.started` timestamp as a reference.

### Corrected version of the `Worker` class
```python
class Worker(object):
    """
    Structure for tracking worker activity and keeping their references.
    """

    def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
        self.id = worker_id
        self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world
        self.last_active = last_active
        self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        self.tasks = set()  # task objects
        self.info = {}
        
    def prune(self, config):
        if self.last_active is None or self.last_active + config.worker_disconnect_delay < time.time():
            # Handle case where last_active is None or time difference comparison
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

With this correction, the `prune` method will now handle the situation where `self.last_active` is `None` and avoid the 'unsupported operand type(s) for +: 'NoneType' and 'int'` error.
