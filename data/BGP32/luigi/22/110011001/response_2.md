### Explanation
The error message indicates a `TypeError` when trying to add `NoneType` (the value of `self.last_active` when not provided) to an integer. This occurs in the `prune` method when attempting to check if a worker should be pruned based on their last activity time compared to the current time.

### Bug Location
The bug is located in the `prune` method where `self.last_active` is not handled properly when it is not provided during the initialization of the Worker object.

### Cause of the Bug
The bug is caused by `self.last_active` being set to `None` by default when it is not provided during the initialization. When trying to add `None` to an integer (`worker_disconnect_delay` which is an integer), it causes a `TypeError`.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug
To fix the bug, we need to handle the case when `self.last_active` is `None` in a way that prevents the `TypeError` when checking if a worker should be pruned based on their last activity time.

### The corrected version of the buggy function
```python
class Worker(object):
    """
    Structure for tracking worker activity and keeping their references.
    """

    def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
        self.id = worker_id
        self.reference = None
        self.last_active = last_active
        self.started = time.time()
        self.tasks = set()
        self.info = {}

    def prune(self, config):
        if self.last_active is not None:  # Check if last_active is provided
            if self.last_active + config.worker_disconnect_delay < time.time():
                # Do something to prune the worker
                pass
``` 

By checking if `self.last_active` is not `None` before performing the comparison with the current time, the corrected version ensures that the operation is only executed when `self.last_active` has a valid time value.
