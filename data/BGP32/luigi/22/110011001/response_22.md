### Analyzing the buggy function

1. The `Worker` class constructor is initialized with `worker_id` and `last_active` parameters.
2. The issue occurs when trying to compare `self.last_active` (which can be `None`) and `config.worker_disconnect_delay` (which is an integer).
3. The error message indicates that the expression `self.last_active + config.worker_disconnect_delay` attempts to add a `NoneType` and an `int`.
4. The bug lies in the fact that `last_active` is not properly handled when it's set to `None`.

### Fixing the bug

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that `last_active` is properly handled when it's set to `None`. One approach is to initialize `last_active` with `time.time()` if it's not provided during object creation.

### Corrected version of the function
```python
class Worker(object):
    """
    Structure for tracking worker activity and keeping their references.
    """
    
    def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
        self.id = worker_id
        self.reference = None
        self.last_active = last_active if last_active else time.time()  # Ensure last_active is initialized properly
        self.started = time.time()
        self.tasks = set()
        self.info = {}
``` 

By updating the initialization logic for `last_active`, we ensure that it is set to the current time if not provided during object creation. This modification prevents the `NoneType` error when comparing `last_active` with an integer value.
