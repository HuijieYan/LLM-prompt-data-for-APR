### Analyzing the buggy function
1. The `Worker` class has an `__init__` function that initializes various attributes for a worker object, including `last_active`.
2. The error occurs when trying to prune workers that have not been active for a certain period based on the `last_active` attribute.
3. In the failing test, the error message indicates that there is a `TypeError` because the `last_active` attribute is of type `NoneType` when trying to perform addition with an integer.

### Bug Identification
The bug arises from the initialization of the `last_active` attribute. Since the default value for `last_active` in the `__init__` function is `None`, the comparison operation in the `prune` method causes a `TypeError` when `None` is involved in arithmetic.

### Bug Cause
The bug occurs because when `last_active` is not provided during the initialization of a `Worker` object, it defaults to `None`. When the `prune` method is called without updating `last_active`, it leads to a type mismatch (`NoneType` and `int`) during arithmetic operations.

### Fixing the Bug
To fix the bug, we need to handle the case where `last_active` is not provided during object initialization. We can set a default value for `last_active` to be the current time when it is not provided.

### Corrected Version of the Function
```python
import time

class Worker(object):
    """
    Structure for tracking worker activity and keeping their references.
    """

    def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
        self.id = worker_id
        self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world (Currently a dict containing just the host)
        self.last_active = last_active if last_active is not None else time.time()  # seconds since epoch or current time
        self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        self.tasks = set()  # task objects
        self.info = {}

    def prune(self, config):
        # Delete workers that haven't said anything for a while (probably killed)
        if self.last_active + config.worker_disconnect_delay < time.time():
            # Perform pruning operations here
            pass
```

By setting a default value for `last_active` in the `__init__` function based on the current time if it is not provided, we prevent the `TypeError` when performing arithmetic operations in the `prune` method.
