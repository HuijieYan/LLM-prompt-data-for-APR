### Analysis
The error occurs when trying to sum `self.last_active` (which is initially set to `None`) with an integer (`config.worker_disconnect_delay`). The error message clearly states that there is an unsupported operand type for `+` between a `NoneType` and an `int`.

### Bug Cause
The bug is caused by initializing `last_active` as `None` in the `__init__` method of the `Worker` class. When trying to calculate the expiration time for pruning workers, it leads to a `TypeError` due to trying to add `None` with an integer.

### Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, you need to handle the case when `last_active` is `None` within the `prune` method of the `Worker` class. You can either set a default value for `last_active` in the `__init__` method or check for `None` in the `prune` method before adding it to `time.time()`.

### Corrected Version
```python
class Worker(object):
    """
    Structure for tracking worker activity and keeping their references.
    """

    def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
        self.id = worker_id
        self.reference = None
        self.last_active = last_active if last_active is not None else time.time()  # Setting default value if last_active is None
        self.started = time.time()
        self.tasks = set()
        self.info = {}
    
    def prune(self, config):
        # Delete workers that haven't said anything for a while (probably killed)
        if self.last_active + config.worker_disconnect_delay < time.time():
            # Prune the worker
            pass
```

By setting a default value for `last_active` based on the current time if it's `None`, the bug should be fixed.
