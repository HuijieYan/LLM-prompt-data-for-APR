The bug in the `Worker` class `__init__` function is that it doesn't initialize the `last_active` attribute correctly, causing an issue when the `prune()` method is called later in the test function. The `last_active` attribute is expected to default to `None` if no value is provided, but in the current implementation, it is set to the value of `time.time()` instead.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is caused by the incorrect assignment of the `last_active` attribute in the `__init__` function. The default value is supposed to be `None`, but it is being set to the current time instead.

### Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, the `last_active` attribute should default to `None` when not provided during initialization.

### Corrected Version:
```python
class Worker(object):
    """
    Structure for tracking worker activity and keeping their references.
    """

    def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
        self.id = worker_id
        self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
        self.last_active = last_active if last_active is not None else None
        self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        self.tasks = set()  # task objects
        self.info = {}
```

By making this change, the `last_active` attribute will default to `None` if no value is provided, resolving the bug in the `Worker` class.
