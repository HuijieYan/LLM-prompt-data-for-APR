The bug in the provided code is that the `prune` method is being called on the `worker` object in the test function, but the `prune` method is not defined in the `Worker` class. This results in a `AttributeError` when running the test.

To fix this bug:
1. Define the `prune` method in the `Worker` class to handle the logic of pruning tasks.
2. Update the test function to either check for the absence of the `prune` method or modify the test to work with the `Worker` class as it is currently defined.

Here is the corrected version of the `Worker` class with a basic `prune` method added:
```python
# The declaration of the class containing the corrected function
class Worker(object):
    """
    Structure for tracking worker activity and keeping their references.
    """

    def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
        self.id = worker_id
        self.reference = None 
        self.last_active = last_active  
        self.started = time.time() 
        self.tasks = set() 
        self.info = {}

    def prune(self, cfg):  # Added prune method
        # Add logic here to prune tasks based on configuration
        pass
```

After adding the `prune` method to the `Worker` class, the test should be modified to handle the absence of the `prune` method or updated to work with the new method.
