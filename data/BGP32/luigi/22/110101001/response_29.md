The bug in the `Worker` class `__init__` function is that it is missing a necessary method `prune` that is being called in the failing test `test_worker_prune_after_init`.

To fix this bug, we need to add the `prune` method to the `Worker` class. The `prune` method should be responsible for checking if the worker has been inactive for a certain amount of time and disconnecting the worker if so.

Here is the corrected version of the `Worker` class with the added `prune` method:

```python
import time

class Worker(object):
    """
    Structure for tracking worker activity and keeping their references.
    """

    def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
        self.id = worker_id
        self.reference = None
        self.last_active = last_active
        self.started = time.time()
        self.tasks = set()
        self.info = {}

    def prune(self, config):
        if self.last_active is not None:
            current_time = time.time()
            if (current_time - self.last_active) > config.worker_disconnect_delay:
                # Worker has been inactive for too long, disconnect it
                self.reference = None
                self.last_active = None
                self.tasks = set()
                self.info = {}
```

Now, when the `prune` method is called in the test `test_worker_prune_after_init`, it will not result in an error, and the test should pass successfully.
