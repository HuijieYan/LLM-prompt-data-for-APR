### Bug Explanation
The bug in the `Worker` class `__init__` method lies in the fact that it initializes `last_active` to `None` and then assigns the current time to `self.started`. However, when calling the `prune` method in the test function, the `prune` method expects `last_active` to be an integer representing the seconds since epoch. Since `last_active` is initialized as `None`, it causes an issue when trying to prune the worker.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that `last_active` is initialized properly as the current time in seconds since epoch if it is not provided during object creation.

### Corrected Version
```python
class Worker(object):
    """
    Structure for tracking worker activity and keeping their references.
    """

    def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
        self.id = worker_id
        self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
        self.last_active = last_active if last_active is not None else int(time.time())  # seconds since epoch
        self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        self.tasks = set()  # task objects
        self.info = {}
``` 

By initializing `last_active` as the current time in seconds since epoch if it is `None`, the corrected version of the `Worker` class should now successfully prune the worker in the test function.
