The bug in the `Worker` class lies in the fact that the `prune` method is being called in the failing test, but the `prune` method is not defined within the class. This is causing the test to fail as it tries to call a method that doesn't exist.

To fix this bug, we should add a `prune` method to the `Worker` class that takes the worker configuration as a parameter and performs pruning based on the configuration.

Here is the corrected version of the `Worker` class with the added `prune` method:

```python
class Worker(object):
    """
    Structure for tracking worker activity and keeping their references.
    """

    def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
        self.id = worker_id
        self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
        self.last_active = last_active  # seconds since epoch
        self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        self.tasks = set()  # task objects
        self.info = {}

    def prune(self, worker_cfg):
        current_time = time.time()
        if (current_time - self.last_active) > worker_cfg.worker_disconnect_delay:
            # Perform pruning logic here
            self.last_active = None
            self.tasks = set()
```

With this correction, the failing test should now pass as the `prune` method is correctly implemented in the `Worker` class.
