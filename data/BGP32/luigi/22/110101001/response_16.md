The bug in the `Worker` class `__init__` function leads to a failure in the `test_worker_prune_after_init` test. The issue is that the `Worker` class lacks an implementation of the `prune` method needed in the test.

To fix the bug, we need to first add the `prune` method to the `Worker` class. We can update the `Worker` class as follows:

```python
class Worker:
    def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
        self.id = worker_id
        self.reference = None
        self.last_active = last_active
        self.started = time.time()
        self.tasks = set()
        self.info = {}

    def prune(self, config):
        current_time = time.time()
        if self.last_active and (current_time - self.last_active) > config.worker_disconnect_delay:
            self.reference = None

```

With the `prune` method implemented, the `test_worker_prune_after_init` test should now pass. The method checks if the worker's `last_active` time is older than the `worker_disconnect_delay` configured time and sets the `reference` to `None` in such a case.

After applying this fix, running the failing test should result in a successful outcome.
