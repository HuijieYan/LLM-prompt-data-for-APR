The bug in the `Worker` class `__init__` function is that it lacks a `prune` method which is being called in the failing test `test_worker_prune_after_init`. The `prune` method is expected to be a part of the `Worker` class but it is missing in the provided code.

To fix this bug, we need to add a `prune` method to the `Worker` class that handles the pruning logic. Below is the corrected version of the `Worker` class with the added `prune` method:

```python
class Worker(object):
    """
    Structure for tracking worker activity and keeping their references.
    """

    def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
        self.id = worker_id
        self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
        self.last_active = last_active  # seconds since epoch
        self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        self.tasks = set()  # task objects
        self.info = {}

    def prune(self, config):
        """
        Prune the worker based on the provided configuration.
        """
        if self.last_active and time.time() - self.last_active > config.worker_disconnect_delay:
            # logic to prune the worker, e.g. remove tasks, reset variables, etc.
            self.tasks = set()
            self.info = {}
```

By adding the `prune` method to the `Worker` class, we ensure that it is properly defined and can be called in the failing test without causing an error. This corrected version should now pass the `test_worker_prune_after_init` test.
