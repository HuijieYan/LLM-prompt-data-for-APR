The issue in the buggy function `__init__` lies in how the `last_active` parameter is handled. When the `last_active` parameter is not provided, it is set to `None`. Later in the function, the line `self.last_active = last_active` assigns this `None` value to `self.last_active`.

The failing test `test_worker_prune_after_init` creates a `Worker` object without providing a `last_active` value. When the `prune` method is called on this object, it expects `self.last_active` to be a valid timestamp (seconds since epoch), but it is `None` instead.

To fix this bug, we need to ensure that `self.last_active` is always set to a valid timestamp value, even when the `last_active` parameter is not provided.

Here is the corrected version of the `__init__` function:

```python
    def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
        self.id = worker_id
        self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
        self.last_active = last_active if last_active is not None else time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        self.tasks = set()  # task objects
        self.info = {}
```

By using a conditional statement to check if `last_active` is provided, we assign either the provided value or the current timestamp if it is not given. This ensures that `self.last_active` will always have a valid timestamp value.
