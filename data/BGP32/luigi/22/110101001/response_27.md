### Bug Explanation
The failing test `test_worker_prune_after_init` is trying to call a method `prune` on the `Worker` instance, but the `Worker` class does not have a `prune` method defined. This leads to a `AttributeError` when the test is executed.

### Fix Strategy
To fix this bug, we need to define a `prune` method in the `Worker` class to satisfy the failing test. We can define the `prune` method to take a configuration parameter as input and update the `last_active` attribute of the worker based on the configuration.

### Corrected Version
```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: luigi/scheduler.py

# The declaration of the class containing the corrected function
class Worker(object):
    """
    Structure for tracking worker activity and keeping their references.
    """

    # Corrected version of the buggy function
    def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
        self.id = worker_id
        self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
        self.last_active = last_active  # seconds since epoch
        self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        self.tasks = set()  # task objects
        self.info = {}

    def prune(self, config):
        current_time = time.time()
        if current_time - self.last_active > config.worker_disconnect_delay:
            self.last_active = current_time
``` 

After applying this fix, the `prune` method will update the `last_active` attribute of the `Worker` instance based on the configuration parameter provided in the test, fulfilling the requirements of the failing test.
