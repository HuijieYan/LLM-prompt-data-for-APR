### Analysis
The issue in the buggy function is that it is missing the `prune` method that is being called in the failing test. The `prune` method is expected to be a part of the `Worker` class but it is not implemented in the current code.

### Bug Cause
The failing test `test_worker_prune_after_init` is calling the `prune` method on the `Worker` object, but the `prune` method is missing from the `Worker` class definition. This is causing the test to fail as the method is not implemented.

### Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to add the `prune` method to the `Worker` class and implement its functionality.

### Corrected Version
Below is the corrected version of the `Worker` class with the added `prune` method:

```python
# The declaration of the class containing the corrected function
class Worker(object):
    """
    Structure for tracking worker activity and keeping their references.
    """

    def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
        self.id = worker_id
        self.reference = None
        self.last_active = last_active
        self.started = time.time()
        self.tasks = set()
        self.info = {}

    def prune(self, config):
        if self.last_active is not None:
            current_time = time.time()
            if current_time - self.last_active > config.worker_disconnect_delay:
                # Prune the worker by resetting its attributes
                self.reference = None
                self.last_active = None
                self.started = None
                self.tasks = set()
                self.info = {}
```

With this corrected version, the `prune` method is now implemented in the `Worker` class and should pass the failing test `test_worker_prune_after_init`.
