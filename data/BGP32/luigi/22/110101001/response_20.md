The bug in the `Worker` class `__init__` method lies in the fact that the method `prune` is being called on the `Worker` object, but the `prune` method itself is not implemented in the provided code snippet. This causes the test `test_worker_prune_after_init` to fail because it tries to call `prune` on the `Worker` object, but the method is missing.

To fix the bug, we need to define the `prune` method within the `Worker` class. Since the purpose of the `prune` method is not clear from the given code snippet, I will assume a simple implementation where the `prune` method clears the `tasks` set after a certain delay specified in the configuration passed as an argument.

Here is the corrected version of the `Worker` class with the added `prune` method:

```python
# The corrected version of the buggy file: luigi/scheduler.py

import time

class Worker(object):
    """
    Structure for tracking worker activity and keeping their references.
    """

    def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
        self.id = worker_id
        self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
        self.last_active = last_active  # seconds since epoch
        self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        self.tasks = set()  # task objects
        self.info = {}

    def prune(self, config):
        if time.time() - self.started > config.worker_disconnect_delay:
            self.tasks.clear()
```

With the `prune` method defined in the `Worker` class, the `test_worker_prune_after_init` test should now pass without any errors.

This fix ensures that the `prune` method is available in the `Worker` class for the test to call, resolving the issue of the missing method that caused the test failure.
