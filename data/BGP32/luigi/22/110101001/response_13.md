### Analysis
The buggy function `__init__` in the `Worker` class is incorrectly setting the `last_active` parameter to the current time when the worker is initialized. This behavior is causing the failing test `test_worker_prune_after_init` to fail because the `last_active` time should be `None` initially, and only updated when the worker performs some activity.

### Bug Cause
The bug is caused by the incorrect initialization of `last_active` in the `__init__` method. Setting `last_active` to `time.time()` at the start leads to a non-`None` value for a new worker, causing the `prune` method to incorrectly think that the worker has been active recently.

### Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to modify the `__init__` method to correctly initialize `last_active` as `None` initially, and update it only when the worker performs some activity.

### Corrected Version
```python
class Worker(object):
    """
    Structure for tracking worker activity and keeping their references.
    """

    def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
        self.id = worker_id
        self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
        self.last_active = last_active  # seconds since epoch
        self.started = time.time() if last_active is None else last_active  # seconds since epoch
        self.tasks = set()  # task objects
        self.info = {}
```
