### Analysis
The buggy function `__init__` in the `Worker` class is supposed to initialize various attributes of a worker object. The bug in the function is related to the initialization of the `last_active` attribute. The `last_active` attribute is meant to store the time in seconds since epoch when the worker was last active, but it is incorrectly initialized as a default parameter that remains None if not explicitly provided.

The failing test `test_worker_prune_after_init` creates a `Worker` object and then calls a method `prune` on it, which is not defined in the provided code snippet but is expected to be able to handle the `last_active` attribute correctly.

### Bug
The bug lies in the `__init__` function where the `last_active` is initialized to `None` as a default value. This results in the `last_active` attribute not being set correctly when an instance of `Worker` is created. 

### Fix
To fix the bug, update the `__init__` function to set `last_active` to the current timestamp (seconds since epoch) if it is not provided during object creation.

### Corrected Version
```python
class Worker(object):
    """
    Structure for tracking worker activity and keeping their references.
    """

    def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
        self.id = worker_id
        self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
        self.last_active = last_active if last_active is not None else time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        self.tasks = set()  # task objects
        self.info = {}
```

After applying this fix, the `last_active` attribute of a `Worker` object will be initialized to the current timestamp if not provided explicitly, ensuring that the `prune` method or any other method that relies on the `last_active` attribute works correctly.
