## Analysis:
The buggy function is the `__init__` method of the `Worker` class. This method initializes the `Worker` object with some attributes like `id`, `reference`, `last_active`, `started`, `tasks`, and `info`.

## Error Location:
The potential error in this function is with the `last_active` attribute. The default value of `None` for `last_active` is not ideal, as it could potentially cause issues later in the code when comparing or using this attribute.

## Cause of the Bug:
The bug arises from using `None` as the default value for `last_active`. When referencing `last_active` in the code, Python may throw errors due to unexpected behaviors with `NoneType` objects.

## Strategy to Fix the Bug:
To fix this bug, we need to handle the case where `last_active` is `None` and replace it with a proper value. One common approach is to assign the current time when `last_active` is `None`, representing the time when the worker was last active.

## Corrected Version:
Here is the corrected version of the `__init__` method in the `Worker` class:

```python
def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
    self.id = worker_id
    self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
    self.last_active = last_active if last_active is not None else time.time()  # seconds since epoch
    self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
    self.tasks = set()  # task objects
    self.info = {}
```

In this corrected version, we check if `last_active` is `None`, and if it is, we assign the current time using `time.time()` to represent the time when the worker was last active. This ensures that `last_active` always has a valid value and prevents any potential issues related to `NoneType`.
