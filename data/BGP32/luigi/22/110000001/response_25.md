## Analysis:
The buggy function `__init__` in the `Worker` class is attempting to initialize the Worker object with certain attributes. However, there is a potential issue with the default argument for `last_active`, which is set to `None`. This could lead to problems when trying to compare the `last_active` time to the current time.

## Identified Bug:
The bug in the `__init__` function is that if `last_active` is not provided when creating a `Worker` object, it defaults to `None`. This can cause comparison issues and potential errors later in the code.

## Bug Cause:
The bug arises due to the default value of `None` for the `last_active` argument. When comparing `last_active` to the current time, if `last_active` remains `None`, it can result in invalid comparisons or calculations.

## Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we should check if `last_active` is `None` when initializing the Worker object. If it is `None`, we can set it to the current time as well for consistency and to avoid potential issues with comparisons.

## Corrected Version:
```python
    # The corrected version of the buggy function
    def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
        self.id = worker_id
        self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
        if last_active is None:
            self.last_active = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        else:
            self.last_active = last_active
        self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        self.tasks = set()  # task objects
        self.info = {}
``` 

By making this change, we ensure that if `last_active` is not provided, it defaults to the current time instead of `None`. This will prevent any potential comparison or calculation issues related to `last_active`.
