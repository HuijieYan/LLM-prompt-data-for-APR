## Analysis:
The buggy function is the `__init__` constructor of the `Worker` class. The function initializes the worker object with the provided `worker_id`, `last_active`, and default values for other attributes like `reference`, `started`, `tasks`, and `info`.

## Potential Error Locations:
The potential error in the code could be related to the default argument `last_active=None` and its initialization when creating an instance of the `Worker` class. If `last_active` is not provided during the object creation, it defaults to `None`, which might lead to issues when comparing it with the current time.

## Cause of the Bug:
The bug arises from the fact that `last_active` is initialized with `None`, and the code later compares it with the current time. This comparison might lead to unexpected behavior, especially if calculations involve `None` and timestamps.

## Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we can modify the `__init__` function to set `last_active` to the current timestamp if it is not provided during object creation. By doing this, we ensure that `last_active` always contains a valid timestamp for comparison purposes.

## Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
import time

class Worker(object):
    """
    Structure for tracking worker activity and keeping their references.
    """

    def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
        self.id = worker_id
        self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
        self.last_active = last_active if last_active is not None else time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        self.tasks = set()  # task objects
        self.info = {}

# Now the __init__ function ensures that last_active is initialized correctly with the current timestamp if not provided explicitly.
``` 

By making this modification, we address the potential bug and ensure that the `last_active` attribute is always set to a valid timestamp for comparison purposes.
