The bug in the provided function lies in the default argument `last_active=None` in the `__init__` method of the `Worker` class. When a Worker object is instantiated without providing the `last_active` parameter, it defaults to `None`. However, the intention might be to set `last_active` to the current time if no value is provided.

To fix this bug, we can modify the `__init__` method to conditionally set `last_active` to the current time if it is not provided during instantiation.

Here is the corrected version of the `__init__` method:

```python
    def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
        self.id = worker_id
        self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
        self.last_active = last_active if last_active is not None else time.time()  # seconds since epoch or current time
        self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        self.tasks = set()  # task objects
        self.info = {}
```

With this modification, the `last_active` attribute of the `Worker` object will default to the current time if no specific value is provided during instantiation.

You can now use this corrected version of the `__init__` method to fix the bug in the `Worker` class.
