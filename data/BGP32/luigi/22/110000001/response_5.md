The bug in the `__init__` function of the `Worker` class is that the default argument `last_active=None` is not being handled properly. When an instance of the `Worker` class is created without providing a value for `last_active`, it will default to `None`. This can lead to potential issues when using `last_active` later in the class logic, as `None` might not be a valid value for comparison or arithmetic operations.

To fix this bug, we should handle the case where `last_active` is `None` and assign a proper default value. We can use the current timestamp as the default value for `last_active` if it is not provided.

Here is the corrected version of the `__init__` function:

```python
def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
    self.id = worker_id
    self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
    self.last_active = last_active if last_active is not None else time.time()  # seconds since epoch or current time
    self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
    self.tasks = set()  # task objects
    self.info = {}
```

With this modification, if `last_active` is not provided during the instantiation of a `Worker` object, it will default to the current timestamp using `time.time()`. This ensures that `last_active` always has a valid value for further processing within the class.
