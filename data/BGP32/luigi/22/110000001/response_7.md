## Analysis:
The buggy function is the `__init__` constructor for the `Worker` class. The purpose of this function is to initialize a `Worker` object with the provided `worker_id`, `last_active` timestamp, and other attributes.

## Potential error locations:
1. The default value for `last_active` parameter is set to `None`, which might cause issues if it is used without being properly checked.
2. The `started` attribute is set to the current time using `time.time()`, but this should reflect the time when the worker was actually started, not the time the `Worker` object is created.

## Cause of the bug:
The bug in this function lies in the incorrect initialization of the `last_active` and `started` attributes. Setting `last_active` to `None` without proper checks may lead to errors when comparing or using this attribute. Additionally, setting `started` to the current time during object creation does not accurately represent when the worker started its actual work.

## Strategy for fixing the bug:
1. Update the `last_active` attribute to handle the case when `last_active` is not provided.
2. Set the `started` attribute to `None` initially and update it when the worker actually starts.

## Corrected version of the function:
```python
class Worker(object):
    """
    Structure for tracking worker activity and keeping their references.
    """

    def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
        self.id = worker_id
        self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
        self.last_active = last_active if last_active is not None else time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        self.started = None  # seconds since epoch, not set until worker actually starts
        self.tasks = set()  # task objects
        self.info = {}
```

In the corrected version:
- `last_active` is initialized using the provided parameter if not `None`, else it is set to the current time.
- `started` is initialized as `None` and should be updated to the actual start time during execution.
