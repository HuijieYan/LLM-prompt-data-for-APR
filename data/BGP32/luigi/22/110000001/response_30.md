## Analysis:
The `__init__` function of the `Worker` class initializes the attributes of a worker object. The bug in the function is that it is using the `time.time()` function to set the `started` attribute to the current time in seconds since epoch. However, if the `last_active` parameter is not provided, it is set to `None`, which causes a bug when trying to compare it with `time.time()`.

## Potential Error Locations:
- Assigning `None` to `last_active` when not provided explicitly.
- Comparing `last_active` with `time.time()` without checking for `None`.

## Cause of the Bug:
The bug occurs because when `last_active` is `None`, an attempt is made to compare `None` with the result of `time.time()`, which is not a valid comparison.

## Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we should check if `last_active` is `None` before comparing it with the current time using `time.time()`. If it is `None`, we can either set it to the current time or handle the case accordingly.

## Corrected Version:
```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: luigi/scheduler_corrections.py

class Worker(object):
    """
    Structure for tracking worker activity and keeping their references.
    """

    def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
        self.id = worker_id
        self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
        self.last_active = last_active if last_active is not None else time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        self.tasks = set()  # task objects
        self.info = {}
```

In the corrected version, the `last_active` attribute is set to the current time using `time.time()` only if it is `None`. This ensures that we have a valid comparison when checking the last activity of the worker.
