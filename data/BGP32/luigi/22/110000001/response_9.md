The issue with the current implementation of the __init__ method in the Worker class is that the default argument `last_active=None` is assigned the same mutable object `None` for all instances of the class. This means that if one instance changes the value of `last_active`, it will reflect in all instances due to them sharing the same reference to `None`.

To fix this issue, we can assign `None` as the default value inside the __init__ method itself rather than in the function definition.

Here is the corrected version of the __init__ method in the Worker class:

```python
    def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
        self.id = worker_id
        self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
        self.last_active = last_active if last_active is not None else None  # seconds since epoch
        self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        self.tasks = set()  # task objects
        self.info = {}
```

By making this change, each instance of the Worker class will have its own distinct `last_active` attribute, and modifications to this attribute in one instance will not affect others.
