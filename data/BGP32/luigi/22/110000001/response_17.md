The buggy function `__init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None)` in the `Worker` class has an issue with the default value of the `last_active` parameter. 

### Potential Error Locations:
The issue arises from setting a mutable object (like a list or dictionary) as the default value for the `last_active` parameter. In this case, `None` is a mutable object, which can lead to unexpected behavior when the default value is shared across multiple instances of the class.

### Cause of the Bug:
The bug occurs because a mutable default value `None` is shared across all instances of the class. This means that if one instance modifies the default `None` value, it can affect other instances as well.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, it's important to avoid using mutable default values for parameters. Instead, you can use a sentinel value like `None` or define the default value within the function to ensure the default value is unique for each instance.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
Here is the corrected version of the `__init__` function in the `Worker` class:

```python
class Worker(object):
    """
    Structure for tracking worker activity and keeping their references.
    """
    
    def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
        self.id = worker_id
        self.reference = None
        self.last_active = last_active if last_active is not None else time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        self.tasks = set()  # task objects
        self.info = {}
```

In this corrected version, the `last_active` parameter is assigned the current time if it is `None`, ensuring that each instance has a unique default value.
