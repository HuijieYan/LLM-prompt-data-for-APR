The bug in the provided function is that the `last_active` attribute is set to the default value of `None` instead of using the value provided as an argument. This means that the `last_active` attribute will always be `None`, regardless of the value passed during object initialization.

To fix this bug, the `__init__` function should be modified to assign the `last_active` parameter value to the `self.last_active` attribute. If no value is provided during initialization, it should default to `None`.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: luigi/scheduler.py

# The declaration of the class containing the corrected function
class Worker(object):
    """
    Structure for tracking worker activity and keeping their references.
    """

    def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
        self.id = worker_id
        self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
        self.last_active = last_active  # seconds since epoch or None
        self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        self.tasks = set()  # task objects
        self.info = {}
```

Now the `last_active` attribute will correctly capture the value passed during object initialization or default to `None` if no value is provided.
