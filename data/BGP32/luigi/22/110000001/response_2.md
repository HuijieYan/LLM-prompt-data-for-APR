The buggy function is the `__init__` method within the `Worker` class. This method initializes an instance of the `Worker` class with some attributes such as `id`, `reference`, `last_active`, `started`, `tasks`, and `info`.

The potential error location within the buggy function is the default parameter `last_active=None`. If `last_active` is not provided when creating a `Worker` instance, it defaults to `None`. However, this can cause issues when comparing `last_active` with timestamps (seconds since epoch) or during calculations involving time.

The bug in the current implementation is that if `last_active` is not provided, it defaults to `None`. This can lead to comparisons or operations involving `last_active` throwing errors due to the `None` value. To fix this issue, we can set `last_active` to the current time (seconds since epoch) if it is not provided.

Here is the corrected version of the `__init__` method:

```python
def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
    self.id = worker_id
    self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
    
    if last_active is None:
        self.last_active = time.time()  # set last_active to current time if not provided
    else:
        self.last_active = last_active  # seconds since epoch
    
    self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
    self.tasks = set()  # task objects
    self.info = {}
```

By adding a check to set `last_active` to the current time if it is not provided, we ensure that it always contains a valid timestamp. This fix prevents potential errors related to comparing or performing calculations with `last_active` in the `Worker` class.
