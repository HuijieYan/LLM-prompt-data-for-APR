## Analysis:
The buggy function is the `__init__` constructor of the `Worker` class. The function initializes the attributes of a `Worker` instance including `id`, `reference`, `last_active`, `started`, `tasks`, and `info`.

## Identifying potential error locations:
1. The `last_active` parameter is set to `None` by default, which might cause issues if not handled properly.
2. The `time.time()` function call for `started` attribute initialization needs to be imported using `import time`.

## Cause of the bug:
The bug in the provided code is that the `time` module is not imported within the file, leading to a `NameError` when the `time.time()` method is called.

## Strategy for fixing the bug:
To fix the bug, we need to import the `time` module at the beginning of the file before using the `time.time()` method to initialize the `started` attribute.

## Corrected Version:
```python
import time

# The relative path of the buggy file: luigi/scheduler.py

# The declaration of the class containing the buggy function
class Worker(object):
    """
    Structure for tracking worker activity and keeping their references.
    """

    # this is the corrected function
    def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
        self.id = worker_id
        self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
        self.last_active = last_active  # seconds since epoch
        self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        self.tasks = set()  # task objects
        self.info = {}
```

In this corrected version, we have imported the `time` module at the beginning of the file, allowing us to use `time.time()` to initialize the `started` attribute of the `Worker` instance without any errors.
