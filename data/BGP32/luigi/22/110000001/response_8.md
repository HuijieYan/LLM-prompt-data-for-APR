The bug in the provided function lies in the default parameter `last_active=None` in the `__init__` method of the `Worker` class. The issue is that when an instance of the `Worker` class is created without passing the `last_active` argument explicitly, it defaults to `None`. However, since `last_active` is used in the class attributes initialization, it creates a potential problem.

To fix this bug, the default value of `last_active` should be set to `time.time()` instead of `None`. This ensures that if no value is provided for `last_active` during the creation of a `Worker` instance, it will default to the current time.

Here is the corrected version of the `__init__` method:

```python
def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
    self.id = worker_id
    self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
    self.last_active = last_active if last_active is not None else time.time()  # seconds since epoch
    self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
    self.tasks = set()  # task objects
    self.info = {}
```
