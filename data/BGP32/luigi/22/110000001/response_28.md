The issue with the buggy function `__init__` is the default value of `last_active=None`. The intention seems to be to set `last_active` to the current time if no value is provided. However, the `time.time()` function is called during the definition of the class, so it will always use the initial time when the class is defined, not when an instance of the class is created.

To fix this bug, we need to set the default value of `last_active` to `None` and check if it is `None` inside the `__init__` function. If it is `None`, then we can set it to the current time.

Here is the corrected version of the `__init__` function:

```python
class Worker(object):
    """
    Structure for tracking worker activity and keeping their references.
    """

    def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
        self.id = worker_id
        self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
        self.last_active = time.time() if last_active is None else last_active  # seconds since epoch
        self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        self.tasks = set()  # task objects
        self.info = {}
```

This modification ensures that if no value is provided for `last_active`, it will default to the current time when an instance of the `Worker` class is created.
