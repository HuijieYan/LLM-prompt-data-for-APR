## Analysis:
The `__init__` function in the `Worker` class is missing some key functionalities which could potentially lead to errors. The `last_active` parameter is set to `None` by default, but it should be initialized using the current time if not provided. 

## Error Location:
The potential error lies in the assignment of the `last_active` attribute in the `__init__` function. If `last_active` is not provided during object initialization, it will remain `None`, which may cause errors when comparing it to timestamps later on.

## Cause of the Bug:
The bug occurs because the `last_active` attribute is not being handled correctly during the initiation of a `Worker` object. If `last_active` is not provided, it will stay as `None` which could lead to issues when performing comparisons or calculations involving time.

## Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to check if the `last_active` parameter is `None` during object initialization. If it is `None`, we should set it to the current time. This will ensure that the `last_active` attribute always contains a valid timestamp.

## Corrected Version:
```python
import time

class Worker(object):
    """
    Structure for tracking worker activity and keeping their references.
    """

    def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
        self.id = worker_id
        self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
        if last_active is None:
            self.last_active = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        else:
            self.last_active = last_active
        self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        self.tasks = set()  # task objects
        self.info = {}
```

In this corrected version, we check if the `last_active` parameter is `None` and set it to the current time using `time.time()` if it is. This ensures that the `last_active` attribute is always initialized with a valid timestamp.
