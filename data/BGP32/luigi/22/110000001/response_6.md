## Analysis:
The buggy function is the `__init__` method of the `Worker` class, which initializes the worker object with some default values. The bug seems to be related to the default argument `last_active=None` provided to the method.

## Potential Error Location:
The bug might be related to the default argument `last_active=None` being mutable and shared between instances of the `Worker` class.

## Bug Explanation:
When initializing a new `Worker` object without providing a value for `last_active`, all instances will share the same reference to the default `None` value. This means if one instance updates the `last_active` attribute, it will reflect on all other instances that were initialized without explicitly passing a value for `last_active`.

## Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix this bug, one approach is to set `last_active` to `None` inside the `__init__` method if it is not provided during object initialization.

## Corrected Version:
```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: luigi/scheduler.py

# The declaration of the class containing the corrected function
class Worker(object):
    """
    Structure for tracking worker activity and keeping their references.
    """

    def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
        self.id = worker_id
        self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
        self.last_active = last_active if last_active is not None else None  # seconds since epoch
        self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        self.tasks = set()  # task objects
        self.info = {}
``` 

In the corrected version, `last_active` is set to `None` if it is not provided during initialization, ensuring that each instance of the `Worker` class has its own reference to the `last_active` attribute.
