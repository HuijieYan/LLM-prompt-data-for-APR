### Analysis:
The buggy function is the `__init__` method of the `Worker` class. The issue seems to be related to the default argument `last_active=None`. When an instance of the `Worker` class is created without providing the `last_active` parameter, it defaults to `None`. This might cause potential issues when comparing or using this attribute later on.

### Error Location:
The error is in the default initialization of the `last_active` attribute in the `__init__` method.

### Cause of the Bug:
The bug is caused by setting the `last_active` attribute to `None` by default. This can lead to potential errors when comparing or performing calculations involving the `last_active` attribute.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we should use a timestamp value (e.g., the current time) as the default value for `last_active` instead of `None`. This will ensure that a valid timestamp is always set for `last_active`.

### Corrected Version:

```python
class Worker(object):
    """
    Structure for tracking worker activity and keeping their references.
    """

    def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
        self.id = worker_id
        self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
        self.last_active = last_active if last_active is not None else time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        self.tasks = set()  # task objects
        self.info = {}
```

In the corrected version, we check if `last_active` is `None` and only then set it to the current time using `time.time()`. This ensures that a valid timestamp is always present for the `last_active` attribute of the `Worker` instances.
