The bug in the provided function is that the `last_active` parameter, which should default to `None` if not provided, is being set to the value of `time.time()` which represents the seconds since the epoch when the `Worker` object is created.

The cause of the bug is that the default value of `last_active` is supposed to be `None` to indicate that the worker has not been active yet. By setting it to the current time using `time.time()`, the worker is initialized with a false indication of being active at the time of creation.

To fix this bug, the default value of `last_active` should be set to `None` by assigning it in the function declaration rather than initializing it with a value.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
    self.id = worker_id
    self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
    self.last_active = last_active  # seconds since epoch or None
    self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
    self.tasks = set()  # task objects
    self.info = {}
```
