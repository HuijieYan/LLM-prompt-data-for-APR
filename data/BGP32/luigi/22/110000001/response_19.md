The buggy function `__init__` in the `Worker` class is missing the closing parenthesis at the end of the function declaration. This can lead to syntax errors when trying to create an instance of the `Worker` class.

To fix the bug, we need to add the closing parenthesis at the end of the function declaration in the `__init__` method.

Here is the corrected version of the `__init__` function:

```python
def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
    self.id = worker_id
    self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
    self.last_active = last_active  # seconds since epoch
    self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
    self.tasks = set()  # task objects
    self.info = {}
``` 

By adding the closing parenthesis, the `__init__` function will be correctly defined and the `Worker` class instances can be created without any syntax errors.
