The buggy function in the `Worker` class is the `__init__` method. The bug is related to the default value of the `last_active` parameter.

### Potential Error:
The bug in this function lies in the default value assigned to the `last_active` parameter. In Python, mutable default parameters (like a dictionary, list, etc.) can lead to unexpected behavior due to the mutability of the default object shared across all instances.

### Cause of the Bug:
In this case, using `None` as the default value for `last_active` parameter makes it mutable, and any modification to this shared default dictionary will reflect across all instances of the `Worker` class.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix this bug, we should avoid using a mutable default parameter. Instead, we can set `last_active` to `None` within the method itself if no value is provided during initialization.

### Corrected Version:

```python
class Worker(object):
    """
    Structure for tracking worker activity and keeping their references.
    """

    def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
        self.id = worker_id
        self.reference = None
        self.last_active = last_active if last_active is not None else time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        self.started = time.time()
        self.tasks = set()
        self.info = {}
```

In the corrected version, we check if the `last_active` parameter is `None` or not. If it is `None`, we assign the current time using `time.time()` to `last_active` within the `__init__` method. This way, each instance of the `Worker` class will have its own `last_active` value without sharing a mutable default object.
