The bug in the provided function is that the default argument `last_active=None` is being assigned to the same object `last_active` for all instances of the class `Worker`. This means that if the value of `last_active` is changed for one instance of `Worker`, it will reflect on all instances.

To fix this bug, we need to ensure that each instance of `Worker` has its own instance variable for `last_active`.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: luigi/scheduler.py

# The declaration of the class containing the buggy function
class Worker(object):
    """
    Structure for tracking worker activity and keeping their references.
    """

    def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
        self.id = worker_id
        self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
        self.last_active = last_active if last_active is not None else time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        self.tasks = set()  # task objects
        self.info = {}
```

In this corrected version, the `last_active` variable is initialized as `time.time()` only if a value is not provided during the object creation. This ensures that each instance of `Worker` has its own `last_active` value independent of other instances.
