## Analysis:
1. The `__init__` function of the `Worker` class is currently initializing the `last_active` attribute with a default value of `None`, which may cause issues when comparing timestamps with `None`.
2. The `self.started` attribute is being set to the current time using `time.time()`, which is correct.
3. The `tasks` attribute is being initialized as a set, storing task objects.
4. The `info` attribute is initialized as an empty dictionary.

## Bug:
The bug in the current implementation is that the `last_active` attribute is initialized with `None`, which can lead to comparison issues or unexpected behavior when used in timestamp calculations.

## Suggested Fix:
Initialize the `last_active` attribute with the current timestamp to avoid potential issues with None values in timestamp calculations.

## Corrected Version:
```python
class Worker(object):
    """
    Structure for tracking worker activity and keeping their references.
    """

    def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
        self.id = worker_id
        self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
        self.last_active = time.time() if last_active is None else last_active  # seconds since epoch
        self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        self.tasks = set()  # task objects
        self.info = {}
```
