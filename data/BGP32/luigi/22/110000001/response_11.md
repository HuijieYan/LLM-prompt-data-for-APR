The buggy function in the `Worker` class is the `__init__` method. The issue arises from the default argument `last_active=None`. 

The bug occurs because mutable defaults (like None) are typically shared between instances of a class. In this case, if `last_active` is modified in one instance, it will affect all other instances which were created with the default value. This can lead to unexpected behavior and bugs.

To fix this bug, it is recommended to use a sentinel value that is immutable like `None` to indicate that the argument was not provided by the caller, and then set the actual default value within the function body.

Here is the corrected version of the `__init__` method:

```python
def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
    self.id = worker_id
    self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
    self.last_active = last_active if last_active is not None else time.time()  # seconds since epoch
    self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
    self.tasks = set()  # task objects
    self.info = {}
```

By making this change, each instance of the `Worker` class will now have its own `last_active` attribute independent of other instances.
