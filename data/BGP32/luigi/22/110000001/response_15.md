### Analysis:
The buggy function `__init__()` is part of the `Worker` class which is responsible for creating instances of workers with specific attributes. The issue seems to be with the `last_active` parameter being set to `None` by default but is expected to be a timestamp in seconds since epoch.

### Potential Error Locations:
1. The `last_active=None` parameter in the `__init__()` function may be causing issues when comparing or updating this attribute.

### Cause of the Bug:
The bug arises from the incorrect default value of `None` for `last_active` in the `__init__()` function. This can cause issues when working with timestamp calculations or comparisons if `last_active` is not updated correctly.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the `last_active` attribute is initialized with a valid timestamp value instead of `None`. This can be achieved by setting `last_active` to the current time in seconds since epoch if no value is provided.

### Corrected Version:
```python
import time

# The relative path of the buggy file: luigi/scheduler.py

# The declaration of the class containing the buggy function
class Worker(object):
    """
    Structure for tracking worker activity and keeping their references.
    """

    def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
        self.id = worker_id
        self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
        self.last_active = last_active if last_active is not None else time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        self.tasks = set()  # task objects
        self.info = {}
```

In the corrected version, the `__init__()` function checks if `last_active` is not `None`, and if it is `None`, it initializes `last_active` with the current time in seconds since epoch using `time.time()`. This ensures that `last_active` is always initialized with a valid timestamp value.
