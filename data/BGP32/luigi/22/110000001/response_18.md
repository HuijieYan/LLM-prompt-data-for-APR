The bug in the provided function is the incorrect use of the default argument `last_active=None` in the `__init__` method of the `Worker` class. The default argument `last_active=None` is evaluated once when the function is defined, not each time the function is called. This means that all instances of the `Worker` class will share the same `last_active` object if it is not explicitly provided during initialization.

To fix this bug, we need to assign `None` to `last_active` inside the `__init__` method instead of using it as a default argument.

Here is the corrected version of the `__init__` method in the `Worker` class:

```python
def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
    self.id = worker_id
    self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
    
    if last_active is not None:
        self.last_active = last_active  # seconds since epoch
    else:
        self.last_active = None
    
    self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
    self.tasks = set()  # task objects
    self.info = {}
```

By explicitly checking if `last_active` is `None` or not within the `__init__` method, we ensure that each instance of the `Worker` class will have its own `last_active` attribute.
