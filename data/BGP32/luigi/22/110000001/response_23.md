## Potential Error Locations:
1. The `last_active` parameter is initialized as `None`, which might cause issues when comparing it to a timestamp value.
2. The `self.started` attribute is set as the current time using `time.time()`, which may not be accurate if there is a delay between the initialization of the object and the actual start time of the worker.

## Bug Cause:
The bug in this `__init__` method is related to the `last_active` parameter being set to `None` by default. When comparing this value to a timestamp for any checks within the class methods, it might lead to unexpected behavior or errors due to the `None` type. Additionally, setting `self.started` to the current time when the object is instantiated might not accurately represent the actual start time of the worker.

## Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we should initialize `last_active` with a meaningful default value that represents an inactive worker state or the epoch time if no previous activity is recorded. For `self.started`, it should be set when the worker is actually started. We can adjust the initialization of these attributes to ensure correct behavior.

## Corrected Version of the Buggy Function:
```python
def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
    self.id = worker_id
    self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
    if last_active is None:
        self.last_active = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
    else:
        self.last_active = last_active
    self.started = None  # initialize as None
    self.tasks = set()  # task objects
    self.info = {}
``` 

In the corrected version, we check if the `last_active` parameter is None and set `self.last_active` using `time.time()` if it is. We also initialize `self.started` as None to be updated when the worker is actually started. This adjustment ensures that the initialization parameters are set correctly for the worker object.
