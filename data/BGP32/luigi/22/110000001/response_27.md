The bug in the provided code is related to the default argument `last_active=None` in the `__init__` method of the `Worker` class. When an instance of the `Worker` class is created without providing a value for `last_active`, it defaults to `None`, which might cause issues later when comparing `last_active` with timestamps.

To fix this bug, we need to ensure that if `last_active` is not provided during initialization, the current time should be used instead. This way, `last_active` will always have a valid timestamp from the start.

Here is the corrected version of the `__init__` method of the `Worker` class:

```python
class Worker(object):
    """
    Structure for tracking worker activity and keeping their references.
    """

    def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
        self.id = worker_id
        self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
        self.last_active = last_active if last_active is not None else time.time()  # seconds since epoch if last_active is None
        self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        self.tasks = set()  # task objects
        self.info = {}
```

In this corrected version, we check if `last_active` is `None`. If it is `None`, we use `time.time()` to set the current timestamp as the value for `last_active`. Otherwise, we use the provided `last_active` value. This ensures that `last_active` always has a valid timestamp even if not explicitly provided during initialization.
