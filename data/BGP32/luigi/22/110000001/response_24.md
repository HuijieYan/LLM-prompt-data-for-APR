## Explanation:
The bug in the `__init__` method of the `Worker` class lies in the default argument `last_active=None`. When an instance of the Worker class is created without specifying the `last_active` parameter, it defaults to `None`. This can lead to unexpected behavior when comparing `last_active` to an integer value later in the code.

## Strategy for fixing the bug:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that `last_active` defaults to the current time in seconds since epoch if no value is provided. This will prevent any potential issues when comparing `last_active` to other time values in the code.

## Corrected version of the buggy function:
```python
class Worker(object):
    """
    Structure for tracking worker activity and keeping their references.
    """

    # corrected version of the buggy function
    def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
        self.id = worker_id
        self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real-world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
        self.last_active = last_active if last_active is not None else int(time.time())  # seconds since epoch
        self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        self.tasks = set()  # task objects
        self.info = {}
```

In this corrected version, we use a conditional expression to set `last_active` to the current time in seconds since epoch if no value is provided. This ensures that `last_active` always has a valid integer value when compared in the rest of the code.
