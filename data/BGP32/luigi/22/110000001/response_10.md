## Analysis:
- The buggy function is the `__init__` constructor method of the `Worker` class.
- The function initializes attributes of a `Worker` object such as `id`, `reference`, `last_active`, `started`, `tasks`, and `info`.
- The potential error could be related to the default argument `last_active=None`.

## Bug:
The bug lies in the fact that the default argument `last_active=None` for the `last_active` attribute is set once when the class is defined, not when an instance of the `Worker` class is created. As a result, all instances created with `last_active=None` will have the same value which may not be desired.

## Suggested Fix:
To fix the bug, we should set the default value of `last_active` to `None` inside the `__init__` method itself, so that each instance of the `Worker` class has its own `last_active` attribute.

## Corrected Version:
```python
class Worker(object):
    """
    Structure for tracking worker activity and keeping their references.
    """

    def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
        self.id = worker_id
        self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
        
        if last_active is None:
            self.last_active = None
        else:
            self.last_active = last_active
        
        self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        self.tasks = set()  # task objects
        self.info = {}
```
