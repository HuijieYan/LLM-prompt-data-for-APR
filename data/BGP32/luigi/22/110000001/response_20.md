## Analysis:
The buggy function is the `__init__` method of the `Worker` class. It initializes the `Worker` object with the given `worker_id`, `last_active`, and other attributes.

## Bug:
The bug in the code is that the `last_active` attribute is assigned the default value of `None`, which is not what was intended by the code. It should be initialized with the current time in seconds since epoch.

## Fix:
To fix the bug, we need to modify the initialization of the `last_active` attribute in the `__init__` method of the `Worker` class to set it to the current time in seconds since epoch, similar to how `self.started` is initialized.

## Corrected Version:
```python
import time

# The relative path of the buggy file: luigi/scheduler.py

# The declaration of the class containing the buggy function
class Worker(object):
    """
    Structure for tracking worker activity and keeping their references.
    """

    def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
        self.id = worker_id
        self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
        self.last_active = time.time() if last_active is None else last_active  # seconds since epoch
        self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        self.tasks = set()  # task objects
        self.info = {}
```
