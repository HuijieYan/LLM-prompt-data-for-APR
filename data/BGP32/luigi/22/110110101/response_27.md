The buggy function `__init__` in the `Worker` class is causing an error due to trying to add a `NoneType` and an `int` together when calculating `self.last_active + config.worker_disconnect_delay < time.time()`.

### Bug Analysis:
1. The `last_active` parameter in the `__init__` function is initialized as `None`, causing the error when a comparison or arithmetic operation is attempted with it.
2. The comparison `self.last_active + config.worker_disconnect_delay < time.time()` is trying to add `None` with an integer `config.worker_disconnect_delay`.

### Bug Fix:
To resolve this issue, we need to ensure that `last_active` is initialized with the correct initial value (`0.0` in this case) and then update it when needed. Alternatively, we can handle the case when `last_active` is `None` during the comparison. 

Here is the corrected version of the `__init__` function:
```python
def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=0.0):
    self.id = worker_id
    self.reference = None
    self.last_active = last_active if last_active is not None else 0.0
    self.started = time.time()
    self.tasks = set()
    self.info = {}
```

This updated version ensures that `last_active` is initialized properly and avoids the `NoneType` issue that was causing the error.

With this correction, the provided failing test should pass successfully without encountering the `TypeError` that was previously raised.
