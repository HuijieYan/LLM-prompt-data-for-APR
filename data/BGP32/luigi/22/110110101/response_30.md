To fix the bug in the `Worker` class, we need to address the issue where the `last_active` variable can be `None` causing a `TypeError` when trying to add it to an integer. To resolve this, we can set a default value for `last_active` if it is not provided during initialization.

Here is the corrected version of the `Worker` class:

```python
import time

class Worker(object):
    """
    Structure for tracking worker activity and keeping their references.
    """

    def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
        self.id = worker_id
        self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
        self.last_active = last_active if last_active is not None else time.time()  # seconds since epoch or current time
        self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        self.tasks = set()  # task objects
        self.info = {}

    def prune(self, config):
        # Delete workers that haven't said anything for a while (probably killed)
        if self.last_active + config.worker_disconnect_delay < time.time():
            # Perform pruning operation here
            pass
```

By setting `self.last_active` to `time.time()` if the `last_active` is `None`, we ensure that it always contains a valid timestamp. This correction should prevent the `TypeError` from occurring.

This corrected version of the `Worker` class should now pass the failing test `test_worker_prune_after_init`.
