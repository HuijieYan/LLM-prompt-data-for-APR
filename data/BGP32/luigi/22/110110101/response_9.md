The issue in the buggy function is that the `last_active` parameter is initialized with a default value of `None` and later used in a comparison with `time.time()` without checking if it's `None`. This causes a `TypeError` when trying to add `None` with an integer in the `prune` method.

To fix this bug, we need to update the `__init__` method of the `Worker` class to handle the case where `last_active` is not provided. We can set `last_active` to the current time when it's `None`. 

Here is the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
class Worker(object):
    """
    Structure for tracking worker activity and keeping their references.
    """

    def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
        self.id = worker_id
        self.reference = None
        if last_active is not None:
            self.last_active = last_active
        else:
            self.last_active = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        self.tasks = set()
        self.info = {}
```

This correction ensures that if `last_active` is not provided when creating a `Worker` instance, it will default to the current time. This modification should fix the bug and allow the `prune` method to work correctly in the provided unit test.
