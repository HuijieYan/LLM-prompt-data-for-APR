### Fixing the bug
The bug in the `__init__` function of the `Worker` class is caused by the `last_active` parameter being initialized to `None`, which leads to a `TypeError` when trying to add it with an integer in the `prune` method. To fix this, we need to handle the case where `last_active` is `None` and set a default value instead.

Here's the corrected version of the `__init__` function:

```python
    def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
        self.id = worker_id
        self.reference = None  
        self.last_active = last_active if last_active is not None else time.time()  # Set the default value to current time if last_active is None
        self.started = time.time()  
        self.tasks = set()  
        self.info = {}
```

This change ensures that if `last_active` is not provided, it defaults to the current time when the worker is initialized.

With this fix, the `prune` method can safely compare `self.last_active` with an integer, avoiding the `TypeError` mentioned in the failing test.

After applying this correction, the `Worker` class should pass the failing test scenario described.
