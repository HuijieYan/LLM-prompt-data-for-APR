## Corrected version of the buggy function

```python
class Worker(object):
    """
    Structure for tracking worker activity and keeping their references.
    """

    def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
        self.id = worker_id
        self.reference = None  
        self.last_active = last_active if last_active is not None else time.time()
        self.started = time.time()  
        self.tasks = set()  
        self.info = {}
``` 

By modifying the initialization of `last_active` in the `__init__` function, we can ensure that if `last_active` is not provided, it will default to the current time using `time.time()`. This will prevent the `NoneType` error when adding `config.worker_disconnect_delay` to `self.last_active`.
