### Analysis
1. The buggy function `__init__` in the `Worker` class is setting the `last_active` attribute to `None` if no value is provided.
2. The error occurs when trying to access `self.last_active` without checking if it is `None`, causing a `TypeError` when trying to add an integer to `None`.
3. The failing test is trying to prune a worker instance by calling the `prune` method on it, which internally uses `self.last_active`. However, since `last_active` is initialized as `None`, the error happens when trying to add an integer to `None`.
4. To fix the bug, we need to handle the case where `last_active` is `None` before performing any arithmetic operations on it.

### Bug Fix
```python
class Worker(object):
    """
    Structure for tracking worker activity and keeping their references.
    """

    def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
        self.id = worker_id
        self.reference = None
        self.last_active = last_active if last_active is not None else time.time()  # Set current time if last_active is None
        self.started = time.time()
        self.tasks = set()
        self.info = {}

    def prune(self, config):
        if self.last_active is not None and self.last_active + config.worker_disconnect_delay < time.time():
            # Do the pruning logic here
            pass
```

By updating the `__init__` method to set the current time if `last_active` is `None`, we ensure that `self.last_active` is always a valid timestamp. This change will prevent the `TypeError` when trying to add an integer to `None`.
