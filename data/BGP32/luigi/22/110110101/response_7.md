The bug in the provided function is due to the `last_active` parameter being set to `None` by default in the function definition, which leads to a `TypeError` when trying to compare it with an integer in the `prune` method.

To fix this bug, we need to handle the case where `last_active` is `None` and initialize it to the current time when creating a new Worker object.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: luigi/scheduler.py

# The declaration of the class containing the corrected function
class Worker(object):
    """
    Structure for tracking worker activity and keeping their references.
    """

    def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
        self.id = worker_id
        self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
        self.last_active = last_active if last_active is not None else time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        self.tasks = set()  # task objects
        self.info = {}

```

With this correction, the function will now handle the case where `last_active` is `None` by initializing it to the current time. This will prevent the `TypeError` that was occurring before and make the function work correctly as expected in the failing test case.
