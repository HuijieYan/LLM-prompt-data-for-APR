The bug in the `Worker` class `__init__` method is due to the `last_active` parameter having a default value of `None` which causes a `TypeError` when trying to perform addition with an integer value in the `prune` method.

To fix this bug, we need to check if the `last_active` parameter is `None` in the `__init__` method and assign the current time if it is `None`.

Here is the corrected version of the `Worker` class `__init__` method:

```python
class Worker(object):
    """
    Structure for tracking worker activity and keeping their references.
    """

    def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
        self.id = worker_id
        self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
        if last_active is not None:
            self.last_active = last_active  # seconds since epoch
        else:
            self.last_active = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        self.tasks = set()  # task objects
        self.info = {}
```

By checking if `last_active` is not `None`, we ensure that it is initialized properly before it is used in the `prune` method.

The corrected version should now pass the failing test and satisfy the expected input/output values.
