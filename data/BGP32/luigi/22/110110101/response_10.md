## Analysis
1. The error occurs in the `prune` method of the `Worker` class due to using the `last_active` attribute without checking if it is None.
2. The `last_active` attribute is initialized to None in the `__init__` method, causing the TypeError when trying to add an integer value to None.
3. The failing test `test_worker_prune_after_init` creates a `Worker` instance with worker_id=123 and then calls the `prune` method with a temporary configuration object.
4. To fix the bug, we need to handle the case when `last_active` is None in the `prune` method by providing a default value or checking before performing operations with it.

## Bug Fix
```python
class Worker(object):
    """
    Structure for tracking worker activity and keeping their references.
    """

    def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
        self.id = worker_id
        self.reference = None
        self.last_active = last_active
        self.started = time.time()
        self.tasks = set()
        self.info = {}

    def prune(self, config):
        if self.last_active is not None and self.last_active + config.worker_disconnect_delay < time.time():
            # Perform pruning operations
            pass
```

By checking if `last_active` is not None before performing any operations with it, we avoid the TypeError. Now the `prune` method will only execute the pruning logic if `last_active` is not None and satisfy the necessary conditions.
