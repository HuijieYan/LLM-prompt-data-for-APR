The bug in the provided `Worker` class is due to the `last_active` parameter being set to `None` by default in the `__init__` method. This causes a `TypeError` when trying to perform an arithmetic operation with `None`.

To fix this issue, we need to handle the case where `last_active` is `None` and provide a default value to be used in the calculation.

Here is the corrected version of the `Worker` class:

```python
import time

class Worker(object):
    """
    Structure for tracking worker activity and keeping their references.
    """

    def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
        self.id = worker_id
        self.reference = None
        self.last_active = last_active if last_active is not None else time.time()  # handle None case
        self.started = time.time()
        self.tasks = set()
        self.info = {}
```

With this correction, the `last_active` parameter is checked for `None` and if it is `None`, the current time is used as the default value for `last_active`.

This change ensures that the arithmetic operation in the `prune` method will work as expected and prevent the `TypeError` from occurring.
