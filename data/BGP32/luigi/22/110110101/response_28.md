The issue in the provided buggy function is that the `last_active` parameter is set to `None` by default, causing a `TypeError` when trying to add `config.worker_disconnect_delay` to it in the `prune` method.

To fix this bug, we need to handle the case where `last_active` is `None` and initialize it to `0` in that scenario.

Here is the corrected version of the `Worker` class with the `prune` method:
```python
class Worker(object):
    """
    Structure for tracking worker activity and keeping their references.
    """

    def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
        self.id = worker_id
        self.reference = None
        self.last_active = last_active if last_active is not None else 0
        self.started = time.time()
        self.tasks = set()
        self.info = {}

    def prune(self, config):
        if self.last_active + config.worker_disconnect_delay < time.time():
            # Perform pruning actions here
            pass
```

By initializing `last_active` to `0` when it's `None`, we ensure that the addition operation in the `prune` method doesn't raise a `TypeError`.

This corrected version should now pass the failing test case provided and satisfy the expected input/output values.
