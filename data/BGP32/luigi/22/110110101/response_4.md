The bug in the `Worker` class's `__init__` function is due to the `last_active` parameter being set to `None`, causing a `TypeError` when trying to add it to an integer value in the `prune` method. 

To fix the bug, we can provide a default value for `last_active` in case it is not provided during initialization. This default value should be based on the current time since epoch.

Here is the corrected version of the `__init__` function:

```python
# The corrected version of the buggy function
class Worker(object):
    """
    Structure for tracking worker activity and keeping their references.
    """

    def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
        self.id = worker_id
        self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
        self.last_active = last_active if last_active is not None else time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        self.tasks = set()  # task objects
        self.info = {}
```

With this correction, the `last_active` parameter will default to the current time if not explicitly provided, preventing the `TypeError` in the `prune` method.
