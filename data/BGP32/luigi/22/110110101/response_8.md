The issue in the buggy code is that the `last_active` parameter in the `__init__` constructor for the Worker class is defaulted to `None`, but it is later used in the `prune` method without being checked for None. This results in a `TypeError` when trying to add an integer value to None in the calculation inside the `prune` method.

To fix this issue, we can add a check in the `prune` method to handle the case where `last_active` is None before performing the calculation.

Here is the corrected version of the `Worker` class:

```python
class Worker(object):
    """
    Structure for tracking worker activity and keeping their references.
    """

    def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
        self.id = worker_id
        self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
        self.last_active = last_active  # seconds since epoch
        self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        self.tasks = set()  # task objects
        self.info = {}

    def prune(self, config):
        if self.last_active is None or self.last_active + config.worker_disconnect_delay < time.time():
            # Handle the case where last_active is None
            return
```

With this correction, the `prune` method will now check if `last_active` is None before trying to perform any calculations with it, avoiding the `TypeError` described in the failing test.
