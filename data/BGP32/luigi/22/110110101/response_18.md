## Analysis
1. The `Worker` class has an `__init__` method that initializes the object with `worker_id`, `last_active`, `reference`, `started`, `tasks`, and `info`.
2. The buggy function is failing because it tries to perform addition between a `NoneType` (`self.last_active`) and an `int` (`config.worker_disconnect_delay`).
3. The failing test is trying to create a `Worker` object and immediately call the `prune` method on it with a custom configuration object `TmpCfg`.
4. To fix the bug, we should handle the case where `self.last_active` is `None` by defaulting it to `time.time()`.

## Fix
Here is the corrected version of the `__init__` method in the `Worker` class:

```python
class Worker(object):
    """
    Structure for tracking worker activity and keeping their references.
    """

    def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
        self.id = worker_id
        self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
        self.last_active = last_active if last_active is not None else time.time()  # seconds since epoch or default to current time
        self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        self.tasks = set()  # task objects
        self.info = {}
```

With this fix, the `Worker` objects will default `last_active` to the current time if it is not provided during initialization. This will prevent the TypeError when trying to calculate the age of the worker for pruning based on the provided configuration delay.

Now, when the failing test is run, it should not encounter the TypeError and should pass successfully.
