### Analysis
1. The `Worker` class has an `__init__` method that initializes the worker object with an `id`, `last_active` time (defaulted to `None`) and other attributes like `started`, `tasks`, and `info`.
2. The error occurs when trying to calculate if the worker should be pruned based on the `last_active` time compared to the current time.
3. The error message indicates a `TypeError` due to trying to add `NoneType` (`self.last_active`) with an `int` during the `prune` method execution.
4. The bug is caused by `last_active` being set as `None`, and trying to perform arithmetic operations on it without checking for `None` first.
5. To fix the bug, we need to handle the case where `last_active` is `None` in the `prune` method.

### Bug Fix Strategy
1. Check if `self.last_active` is `None` in the `prune` method.
2. If `self.last_active` is `None`, do not perform arithmetic operations on it.
3. Update the logic to prune workers considering if `last_active` is not `None`.

### Corrected Version
```python
class Worker(object):
    """
    Structure for tracking worker activity and keeping their references.
    """

    def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
        self.id = worker_id
        self.reference = None
        self.last_active = last_active
        self.started = time.time()
        self.tasks = set()
        self.info = {}

    def prune(self, config):
        if self.last_active is not None and self.last_active + config.worker_disconnect_delay < time.time():
            # Perform pruning logic here
            pass
```

By adding the check `if self.last_active is not None` before performing the arithmetic operation, we ensure that the operation is only done when `last_active` has a valid value.
