## Analysis
1. The buggy function is the `__init__` method of the `Worker` class in the `luigi.scheduler` module. The function initializes a `Worker` object with an id, last_active time (which can be None), a reference, tasks, and info.
   
2. The failing test `test_worker_prune_after_init` creates a `Worker` object with `worker_id = 123` and immediately calls the `prune` method on it, which results in the TypeError due to trying to perform an operation involving `None` and an `int`.

3. The error occurs when trying to add the `last_active` (which can be None) to an integer (`config.worker_disconnect_delay`). The expected behavior is to skip the prune operation if `last_active` is None.

4. To fix the bug, we can add a check to see if `last_active` is None before trying to add `config.worker_disconnect_delay`.

## Corrected Version
```python
class Worker(object):
    """
    Structure for tracking worker activity and keeping their references.
    """

    def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
        self.id = worker_id
        self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
        self.last_active = last_active  # seconds since epoch
        self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        self.tasks = set()  # task objects
        self.info = {}

    def prune(self, config):
        if self.last_active is not None and self.last_active + config.worker_disconnect_delay < time.time():
            # Perform prune operation
            pass
```

This corrected version of the `Worker` class includes a check to ensure that `self.last_active` is not None before trying to add `config.worker_disconnect_delay`. This check should prevent the TypeError from occurring in the failing test.
