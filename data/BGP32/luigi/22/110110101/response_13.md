## Analysis
1. The buggy function is the `__init__` method of the `Worker` class in the `luigi.scheduler` module.
2. The error occurs when trying to add `last_active` (which is initially `None`) to an integer value which leads to a `TypeError`.
3. The failing test is trying to initialize a `Worker` object with `worker_id` 123 and call the `prune` method on the worker object with a custom `TmpCfg` configuration object. The expected behavior is to prune the worker if it has been inactive for a duration longer than the `worker_disconnect_delay`.
4. To fix the bug, we need to check if `last_active` is `None` before performing the arithmetic operation.

## Bug Fix
```python
class Worker(object):
    """
    Structure for tracking worker activity and keeping their references.
    """

    def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
        self.id = worker_id
        self.reference = None
        self.last_active = last_active if last_active is not None else time.time()  # Fix: if last_active is None, set it to current time
        self.started = time.time()
        self.tasks = set()
        self.info = {}

    def prune(self, config):
        # Delete workers that haven't said anything for a while (probably killed)
        if self.last_active + config.worker_disconnect_delay < time.time():
            pass
```

The bug is fixed by checking if `last_active` is `None` before adding it to `config.worker_disconnect_delay`. If `last_active` is `None`, it is set to the current time. This prevents the `TypeError` that was occurring when attempting to perform arithmetic operations on `None`.
