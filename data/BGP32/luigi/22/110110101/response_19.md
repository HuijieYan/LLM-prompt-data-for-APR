The bug in the provided function is caused by the `last_active` variable being initialized as `None` and then being used in an operation where an integer is expected. To fix this bug, we need to handle the case where `last_active` is `None` and provide a default value.

Here is the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
import time

class Worker(object):
    """
    Structure for tracking worker activity and keeping their references.
    """

    def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
        self.id = worker_id
        self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
        self.last_active = last_active if last_active is not None else time.time()
        self.started = time.time()
        self.tasks = set()  # task objects
        self.info = {}
```

By modifying the `__init__` function to set a default value for `last_active` equal to the current time if it is `None`, we ensure that the operation involving `last_active` later in the code does not raise a `TypeError`.

This correction will allow the `prune` method to work correctly without encountering the `TypeError` raised due to an unsupported operand type.
