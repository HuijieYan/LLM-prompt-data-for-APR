The bug in the provided function is due to the initialization of `self.last_active` with a default value of `None`, which causes a `TypeError` when trying to add an integer value to `None`.

To fix this bug, we need to handle the case where `last_active` is not provided during initialization. We can set `self.last_active` to the current time when `last_active` is not provided.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
class Worker(object):
    """
    Structure for tracking worker activity and keeping their references.
    """

    def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
        self.id = worker_id
        self.reference = None
        self.last_active = last_active if last_active is not None else time.time()
        self.started = time.time()
        self.tasks = set()
        self.info = {}
```

By updating the initialization of `self.last_active`, we ensure that it defaults to the current time if no value is provided, avoiding the `TypeError` when performing arithmetic with it.

With this correction, the function should now pass the failing test case provided.
