The bug in the `Worker` class's `__init__` method arises from the fact that it doesn't handle the case when `last_active` is `None`. This causes an error when trying to add it to another integer value in the `prune` method.

To fix this bug, we need to ensure that if `last_active` is `None`, it is treated as 0 when adding it to another integer in the `prune` method.

Here is the corrected version of the `Worker` class:

```python
# The corrected version of the buggy file: luigi/scheduler.py

class Worker(object):
    """
    Structure for tracking worker activity and keeping their references.
    """

    def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
        self.id = worker_id
        self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
        if last_active is not None:
            self.last_active = last_active  # seconds since epoch
        else:
            self.last_active = 0
        self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        self.tasks = set()  # task objects
        self.info = {}
```

With this correction, the `last_active` value is set to 0 if it is `None`, preventing the TypeError encountered in the failing test.

The corrected version of the class should now pass the failing test scenario by handling the case of `last_active` being `None`.
