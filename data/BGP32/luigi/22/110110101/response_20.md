## Analysis
The bug occurs in the `__init__` method of the `Worker` class. The `last_active` parameter is optional and can be passed as `None`. However, in the initialization code, `self.last_active = last_active` is assigning `None` to `self.last_active`. Later, when `config.worker_disconnect_delay` is added to `self.last_active`, it causes a `TypeError` since you cannot add an `int` to `None`.

## Bug Cause
The `last_active` parameter is assigned to `None` by default when not provided. This default value should be handled appropriately to avoid errors when performing calculations on it.

## Fix Strategy
Check if the `last_active` parameter is `None` and assign the current time if it is. This way, the addition will be valid.

## The Corrected Version
```python
class Worker(object):
    """
    Structure for tracking worker activity and keeping their references.
    """

    def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
        self.id = worker_id
        self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
        self.last_active = last_active if last_active is not None else time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        self.tasks = set()  # task objects
        self.info = {}
```

After making this change, the `Worker` class should be able to handle `None` values correctly and pass the failing test without any `TypeError`.
