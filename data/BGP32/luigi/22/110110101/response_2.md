### Explanation:
The error occurs because the `last_active` parameter is set to `None` by default if no value is provided when creating a `Worker` instance. When trying to add `config.worker_disconnect_delay` to `None` in the `prune` method, a `TypeError` is raised since `None` cannot be added to an integer.

### Fix:
We need to handle the case when `last_active` is `None` in the `prune` method. 

### The corrected version of the buggy function
```python
class Worker(object):
    """
    Structure for tracking worker activity and keeping their references.
    """

    def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
        self.id = worker_id
        self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
        self.last_active = last_active  # seconds since epoch
        self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        self.tasks = set()  # task objects
        self.info = {}
        
    def prune(self, config):
        # Delete workers that haven't said anything for a while (probably killed)
        if self.last_active is not None and self.last_active + config.worker_disconnect_delay < time.time():
            # Perform pruning actions if last_active is not None
            pass
```

By checking if `self.last_active` is not `None` before performing the addition operation, we prevent the `TypeError` from occurring. This corrected version should pass the failing test case.
