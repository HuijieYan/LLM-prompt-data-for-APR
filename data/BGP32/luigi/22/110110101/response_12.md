The bug in the `Worker` class `__init__` method arises from `last_active` being set to `None` initially, which causes the TypeError when trying to add it to an integer value.

To fix this bug in the `__init__` method, we need to handle the case where `last_active` is None and set it to the current time in that case.

Here is the corrected version of the `__init__` method:

```python
class Worker(object):
    """
    Structure for tracking worker activity and keeping their references.
    """

    def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
        self.id = worker_id
        self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
        if last_active is None:
            self.last_active = time.time()  # setting it to current time if last_active is None
        else:
            self.last_active = last_active
        self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        self.tasks = set()  # task objects
        self.info = {}
```

With this correction, the `Worker` class will be initialized correctly, and the `prune` method should work as expected without throwing a TypeError.
