The bug in the buggy function `__init__` of the `Worker` class is due to the `last_active` parameter being set to `None` by default, which causes a `TypeError` when used in a calculation with `time.time()` later in the function. To fix this bug, we need to initialize `self.last_active` properly when `last_active` is not provided during instantiation.

Here is the corrected version of the `Worker` class with the fixed `__init__` function:

```python
class Worker(object):
    """
    Structure for tracking worker activity and keeping their references.
    """

    def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
        self.id = worker_id
        self.reference = None
        self.last_active = last_active if last_active is not None else time.time()  # Initialize last_active properly
        self.started = time.time()
        self.tasks = set()
        self.info = {}
```

By checking if `last_active` is `None` and then initializing `self.last_active` with the current time using `time.time()`, we ensure that the `last_active` value is always a valid timestamp.

This fix will prevent the `TypeError` from occurring when `worker.prune()` is called as shown in the failing test case. The corrected function should now pass the failing test and satisfy all the expected input/output values.
