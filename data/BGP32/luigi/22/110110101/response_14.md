### Analysis
1. The buggy function `__init__` in the `Worker` class initializes the worker object with `worker_id` and `last_active` parameters. The issue arises when `last_active=None` is passed as a default argument, causing `self.last_active` to be of type `NoneType`.
2. The failing test `test_worker_prune_after_init` creates a `Worker` object and tries to call the `prune` method on it, which expects a `config` object with a `worker_disconnect_delay` attribute.
3. The failing test raises a `TypeError` due to trying to add `NoneType` with an `int`.
4. To fix the bug, we need to ensure that if `last_active` is not provided, we set it to a default value rather than `None`.

### Bug Fix
We should modify the `__init__` method in the `Worker` class to handle the case when `last_active` is not provided. We can set a default value for `last_active` using the `or` operator to avoid `NoneType` conflicts.

### The corrected version of the buggy function
```python
class Worker(object):
    """
    Structure for tracking worker activity and keeping their references.
    """
    
    def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
        self.id = worker_id
        self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
        self.last_active = last_active or time.time()  # seconds since epoch or current time if last_active is not provided
        self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        self.tasks = set()  # task objects
        self.info = {}
```

By setting `self.last_active` to `last_active or time.time()`, we ensure that if `last_active` is not provided, it defaults to the current time, preventing any `NoneType` conflicts.
