###  Fixing the buggy function

#### Analysis:
- The bug occurs in the `prune` method where it tries to add a `NoneType` and an `int` which causes the `TypeError`.
- The `last_active` parameter is passed as None when initializing the Worker object, causing the bug when trying to add `config.worker_disconnect_delay` to it.

#### Strategy for fixing the bug:
- We need to handle the case where `last_active` is None by providing a default value.
- We can set the default value to 0 or any other suitable value depending on the requirements.

#### Corrected code:
```python
class Worker(object):
    """
    Structure for tracking worker activity and keeping their references.
    """

    def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=0):
        self.id = worker_id
        self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
        self.last_active = last_active  # seconds since epoch
        self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        self.tasks = set()  # task objects
        self.info = {}
```

Now the corrected Worker class will handle the case where `last_active` is not provided by defaulting it to 0. This will prevent the `TypeError` when trying to add `config.worker_disconnect_delay` to a `NoneType`.
