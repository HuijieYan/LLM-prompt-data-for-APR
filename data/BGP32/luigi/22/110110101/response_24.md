The bug in the provided function is due to the `last_active` parameter being passed as `None` during initialization, causing a `TypeError` when trying to add it to an integer value in the `prune` method. 

To fix this bug, we can modify the `__init__` method of the `Worker` class to handle the case where `last_active` is `None` and set it to the current time if it is not provided.

Here is the corrected version of the `__init__` method:

```python
def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
    self.id = worker_id
    self.reference = None
    if last_active is None:
        self.last_active = time.time()
    else:
        self.last_active = last_active
    self.started = time.time()
    self.tasks = set()
    self.info = {}
```

With this modification, the `last_active` attribute will default to the current time if not provided during initialization, preventing the `TypeError` in the `prune` method.

This corrected version should now pass the failing test case provided.
