After analyzing the buggy function and the failing test case, it seems that the issue lies in the way the `last_active` parameter is handled. The `last_active` parameter is expected to be assigned to the `self.last_active` variable, but it is not processed correctly in the current implementation.

To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the `last_active` parameter is properly assigned to the `self.last_active` variable during initialization.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
import time

# The corrected version of the buggy function
def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
    self.id = worker_id
    self.last_active = last_active if last_active else time.time()  # check if last_active is provided, else set to current time
    self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
    self.tasks = set()  # task objects
    self.info = {}

```

With this correction, the `last_active` parameter is properly assigned to `self.last_active` if provided, or else it defaults to the current time. This ensures that the expected behavior is maintained and the failing test case is passed.

The corrected function should now satisfy the expected input/output values for the failing test case.
