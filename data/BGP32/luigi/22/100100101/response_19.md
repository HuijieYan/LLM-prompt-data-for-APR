## Fixing the Bug

### Analyze the buggy function and its relationship with the failing test
The buggy function initializes a Worker object with a given worker ID and last active time. The failing test then calls the prune method on this Worker object, passing a temporary configuration object.

### Identify potential error locations within the buggy function
The issue seems to be with the initialization of last_active in the __init__ method of the Worker class.

### Explain the cause of the bug
The bug occurs because the last_active parameter is set as None by default in the __init__ method, but the test expects it to be a specific float value. This inconsistency leads to the failing test as the prune method expects last_active to be a float value.

### Suggest a strategy for fixing the bug
To fix the bug, we need to modify the way last_active is initialized in the __init__ method to match the expected value in the test case.

### Corrected Version of the Buggy Function
```python
def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
    self.id = worker_id
    self.reference = None
    self.last_active = last_active if last_active is not None else time.time()
    self.started = time.time()
    self.tasks = set()
    self.info = {}
```

By checking if last_active is None in the __init__ method and assigning it the current time if it is, we ensure that the expected behavior aligns with the test case. This corrected version should pass the failing test.
