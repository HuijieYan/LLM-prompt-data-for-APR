The bug in the `__init__` function is that the `last_active` parameter is not being assigned correctly. The `last_active` parameter should be assigned directly to `self.last_active`.

### Strategy for fixing the bug:
1. Modify the assignment of `last_active` to `self.last_active` inside the `__init__` function.

### Corrected version of the buggy function:
```python
def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
    self.id = worker_id
    self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
    self.last_active = last_active  # seconds since epoch
    self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
    self.tasks = set()  # task objects
    self.info = {}
```

After making this correction, the function should correctly assign the `last_active` parameter to `self.last_active`, and the test should pass with the expected values and types for the variables.
