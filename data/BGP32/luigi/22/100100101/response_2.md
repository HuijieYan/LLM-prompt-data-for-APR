The bug in the provided `__init__` function is that the `last_active` parameter is being initialized incorrectly. The `last_active` parameter should be set to the provided value if it is not `None`, otherwise, it should be set to the current time.

To fix this bug, we can modify the `last_active` initialization logic in the `__init__` function.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
import time

def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
    self.id = worker_id
    self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
    if last_active is not None:
        self.last_active = last_active
    else:
        self.last_active = time.time()
    self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
    self.tasks = set()  # task objects
    self.info = {}
```

This corrected version should now correctly handle the `last_active` parameter initialization and pass the failing test case provided.
