## Analysis
1. The `__init__` function of the `Worker` class in the buggy `scheduler.py` file initializes attributes for a worker instance, including `id`, `last_active`, `reference`, `started`, `tasks`, and `info`.
2. The failing test `test_worker_prune_after_init` creates a `Worker` instance and then calls the `prune` method on it with a temporary configuration object to trigger the bug.

## Bug
The bug in the `__init__` function is that it sets the `last_active` attribute with the passed value but then immediately updates `self.started` with the current time using `time.time()`, overriding the provided `last_active` value.

## Fix
To fix the bug, we should only update `self.started` with the current time if `last_active` is not specified. Otherwise, we should leave it as is.

## The corrected version of the buggy function
```python
def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
    self.id = worker_id
    self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
    if last_active is not None:
        self.last_active = last_active  # seconds since epoch
    else:
        self.last_active = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
    self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
    self.tasks = set()  # task objects
    self.info = {}
```

Now the corrected function will correctly handle the provided `last_active` value and set `self.started` to the current time only when `last_active` is not specified. This fix should pass the failing test and maintain the expected input/output values.
