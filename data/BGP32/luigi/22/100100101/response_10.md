The bug in the `__init__` function of the `Worker` class is that the `last_active` parameter is not being assigned correctly due to the default value being used incorrectly.

### Cause of the bug:
- The `last_active` parameter is supposed to be set to the provided value if it is not None, but currently, the default value is assigned regardless of the provided value.

### Strategy for fixing the bug:
- Check if the `last_active` parameter is None. If it is not None, assign the provided value to `self.last_active`.

### Corrected version of the `__init__` function:
```python
def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
    self.id = worker_id
    self.reference = None
    self.last_active = last_active if last_active is not None else time.time()
    self.started = time.time()
    self.tasks = set()
    self.info = {}
```

By fixing the assignment of the `last_active` parameter, the corrected version of the `__init__` function should now correctly initialize the `Worker` object with the expected values.
