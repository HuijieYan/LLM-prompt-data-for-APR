The issue in the provided code is that the `last_active` parameter is not being passed correctly to the `Worker` class when initiating a new worker object. As a result, the `last_active` attribute of the worker object is not being set to the correct value.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the `__init__` method of the `Worker` class to properly initialize the `last_active` attribute with the provided value.

Here is the corrected version of the code:

```python
# The corrected version of the buggy function
def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
    self.id = worker_id
    self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
    self.last_active = last_active if last_active is not None else time.time()  # initialize with provided value or current time
    self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
    self.tasks = set()  # task objects
    self.info = {}
```

By modifying the initialization of `last_active` to use the provided value if it's not `None`, we ensure that the `last_active` attribute is set correctly when creating a new `Worker` object.

This corrected version of the code should now pass the failing test case `test_worker_prune_after_init`.
