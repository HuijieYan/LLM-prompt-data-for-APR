The issue in the buggy function lies in the incorrect initialization of the `last_active` attribute. It is being set to the value provided in the `last_active` parameter, which is incorrect as it should default to `None` if no value is provided.

To fix this issue, we need to modify the `__init__` function to correctly handle the `last_active` parameter to default to `None` if not provided.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
    self.id = worker_id
    self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
    self.last_active = last_active if last_active is not None else None  # seconds since epoch
    self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
    self.tasks = set()  # task objects
    self.info = {}
```

With this modification, the `last_active` attribute will default to `None` if no value is provided, which aligns with the expected behavior in the failing test case. This corrected version of the function should now pass the failing test.
