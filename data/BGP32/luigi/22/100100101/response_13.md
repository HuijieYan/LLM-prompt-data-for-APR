The bug in the provided code is that the `last_active` parameter is not correctly assigned to the `self.last_active` attribute within the `__init__` method of the `Worker` class. Instead, it is assigned to the `self.started` attribute. This causes the failing test to not prune the worker as expected.

To fix this issue, we need to correctly assign the `last_active` parameter to the `self.last_active` attribute in the `__init__` method.

Here is a corrected version of the `__init__` method for the `Worker` class:

```python
def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
    self.id = worker_id
    self.reference = None  
    self.last_active = last_active if last_active is not None else time.time()  
    self.started = time.time()
    self.tasks = set()  
    self.info = {}
```

By checking if the `last_active` parameter is provided (not None), we assign it to `self.last_active`. Otherwise, we use the current time `time.time()` as the default value for `self.last_active`.

With this correction, the failing test `test_worker_prune_after_init` should pass and the expected input/output values will be satisfied.
