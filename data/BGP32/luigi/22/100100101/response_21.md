The issue with the buggy function is that the `last_active` parameter is not being assigned properly in the `__init__` method of the `Worker` class. Instead, it is assigned the default value of `None` and not the provided value.

To fix this issue, we need to correct the assignment of the `last_active` parameter in the `__init__` method.

Here is the corrected version of the `__init__` method:

```python
def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
    self.id = worker_id
    self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
    self.last_active = last_active if last_active is not None else time.time()  # seconds since epoch
    self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
    self.tasks = set()  # task objects
    self.info = {}
```

This corrected version checks if the `last_active` parameter is provided and assigns it accordingly; otherwise, it assigns the current time using `time.time()`.

With this correction, the `last_active` parameter will be properly initialized based on the provided input value or the current time if no value is provided. This should fix the failing test case.
