The bug in the provided function is that it expects `last_active` to be a float representing seconds since epoch, but in the failing test `last_active` is not provided during initialization. This causes an issue when trying to assign `last_active` directly. 

To fix the bug, we can modify the `__init__` function to check if `last_active` is provided and set it accordingly. If not provided, we can set it to `None`.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
    self.id = worker_id
    self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
    self.last_active = last_active if last_active is not None else time.time()  # seconds since epoch or set to current time
    self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
    self.tasks = set()  # task objects
    self.info = {}
```

With this correction, the function will now correctly handle cases where `last_active` is not provided during initialization, ensuring that the default behavior aligns with the failing test. The corrected function should now pass the failing test case provided.
