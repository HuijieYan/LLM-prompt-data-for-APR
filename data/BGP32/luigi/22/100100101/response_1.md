The bug in the provided code is that the `__init__` function is missing the `self` parameter, causing it to not properly initialize the instance variables of the `Worker` class. 

To fix this bug, we need to add the `self` parameter to the `__init__` function. Here is the corrected version:

```python
# The corrected version of the buggy function
def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
    self.id = worker_id
    self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
    self.last_active = last_active  # seconds since epoch
    self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
    self.tasks = set()  # task objects
    self.info = {}
```

With this correction, the `Worker` class will now properly initialize its instance variables when instantiated. The corrected function will now pass the failing test provided.
