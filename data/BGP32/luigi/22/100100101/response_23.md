The bug in the provided function is that the `last_active` parameter is not being assigned correctly in the `__init__` function. The `last_active` parameter is supposed to be a timestamp in seconds since epoch, but it is being incorrectly assigned directly to the parameter passed in without converting it to a float.

To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the `last_active` parameter is correctly converted to a float before assigning it to `self.last_active` in the `__init__` function.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
# The corrected version of the buggy function
def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
    self.id = worker_id
    self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
    
    if last_active is not None:
        self.last_active = float(last_active)  # Convert last_active to float if not None
    else:
        self.last_active = None
    
    self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
    self.tasks = set()  # task objects
    self.info = {}
```

With this correction, the function will now correctly handle the `last_active` parameter and convert it to a float before assigning it to `self.last_active`.

This correction will ensure that the `Worker` class works as expected and passes the failing test provided.
