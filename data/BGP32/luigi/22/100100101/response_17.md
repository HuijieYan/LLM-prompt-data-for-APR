The issue in the buggy function is that the `last_active` parameter is not being assigned correctly. It is being directly assigned to the `last_active` attribute without conversion to seconds since epoch. This causes a discrepancy when comparing it to the expected value in the failing test.

To fix this bug, we need to convert the `last_active` parameter to seconds since epoch before assigning it to the `last_active` attribute.

Here is the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: luigi/scheduler.py

def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
    self.id = worker_id
    self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
    
    if last_active is not None:
        self.last_active = time.mktime(last_active.timetuple())  # convert last_active to seconds since epoch
    else:
        self.last_active = None
    
    self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
    self.tasks = set()  # task objects
    self.info = {}
```

With this correction, the `last_active` parameter is correctly converted to seconds since epoch before being assigned to the `last_active` attribute. This will ensure that the expected values match the actual values during the failing test execution.
