The issue in the buggy function is that the `last_active` parameter is not being properly assigned to the `last_active` instance variable. The correct assignment should be `self.last_active = last_active` instead of `self.last_active = None`.

By fixing this assignment, the function should work correctly as expected.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
# The corrected version of the buggy function
def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
    self.id = worker_id
    self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
    self.last_active = last_active  # seconds since epoch
    self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
    self.tasks = set()  # task objects
    self.info = {}
``` 

With this fix, the function should now pass the failing test case provided.
