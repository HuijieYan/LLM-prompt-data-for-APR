The bug in the provided function is that the `last_active` parameter is not being properly initialized when the `Worker` object is created. It is only assigned the value of `last_active` if it is provided as an argument, otherwise, it remains `None`.

To fix this bug, we need to initialize the `last_active` attribute properly in the `__init__` method, even if it is not explicitly provided as an argument.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
import time

def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
    self.id = worker_id
    self.reference = None
    self.last_active = last_active if last_active is not None else time.time()
    self.started = time.time()
    self.tasks = set()
    self.info = {}
```

With this correction, the `last_active` attribute of the `Worker` object will be initialized with the current time if no specific value is provided, ensuring correct behavior when initializing the object.

This corrected version should pass the failing test provided.
