The bug in the `__init__` function stems from not properly initializing the `last_active` parameter. In the failing test, an object of the `Worker` class is created without providing the `last_active` parameter value, which leads to the default value `None` being passed to the function. This causes an issue when attempting to access `last_active` in the function, resulting in potential errors.

To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the `last_active` parameter is properly initialized in the `__init__` function.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
    self.id = worker_id
    self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
    self.last_active = last_active if last_active is not None else time.time()  # seconds since epoch
    self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
    self.tasks = set()  # task objects
    self.info = {}
```

With this correction, the `last_active` parameter is initialized to the current time (seconds since epoch) if no value is provided, ensuring that the function works correctly in both cases where `last_active` is provided and where it is not provided.

This corrected version should now pass the failing test.
