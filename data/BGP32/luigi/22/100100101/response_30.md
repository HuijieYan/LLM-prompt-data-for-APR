The bug in the provided function lies in the initialization of the `self.started` attribute. The current implementation assigns `time.time()` to `self.started` outside the function scope, which means it will always store the same value for all instances of the Worker class.

To fix this bug, we should move the assignment of `time.time()` inside the `__init__` function so that each instance of the Worker class initializes `self.started` with the current time.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
    self.id = worker_id
    self.reference = None
    self.last_active = last_active if last_active is not None else time.time()
    self.started = time.time()
    self.tasks = set()
    self.info = {}
```

With this correction, the function will properly initialize the `self.started` attribute with the current time when creating a new instance of the Worker class. This change ensures that each Worker object has its own distinct `started` value based on the time of instantiation.

This corrected version should now pass the failing test scenario provided.
