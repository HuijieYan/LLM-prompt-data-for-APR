The bug in the provided function is that it is missing the `self` parameter in the `__init__` method, resulting in `worker_id` being assigned to `self` instead of the intended `self.id`.

To fix this bug, we need to add the `self` parameter to the `__init__` method.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
    self.id = worker_id
    self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
    self.last_active = last_active  # seconds since epoch
    self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
    self.tasks = set()  # task objects
    self.info = {}
```

With this corrected version, the test case `test_worker_prune_after_init` should pass successfully.
