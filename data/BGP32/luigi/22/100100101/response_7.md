## Analysis
1. The `Worker` class in the buggy function is missing the `self` parameter in its constructor.
2. The `last_active` parameter is set to `None` by default, but it should be initialized with the passed value.
3. The `started` attribute is initialized with the current time using `time.time()`, but it should be the same value as `last_active` if provided.
4. The test function `test_worker_prune_after_init` is trying to create a `Worker` instance and call the `prune` method with a configuration object.

## Bug
The bug in the current implementation is that the `self` parameter is missing in the `__init__` method of the `Worker` class, which leads to an incorrect instance initialization.

## Fix
Add the `self` parameter to the `__init__` method of the `Worker` class and ensure proper initialization of attributes based on input parameters.

## The corrected version
```python
def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
    self.id = worker_id
    self.reference = None
    self.last_active = last_active
    self.started = last_active if last_active is not None else time.time()
    self.tasks = set()
    self.info = {}
```

With this corrected version, the `Worker` class will initialize properly based on the input parameters, fixing the bug identified.
