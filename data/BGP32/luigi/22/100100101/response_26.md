The bug in the provided code is that the `last_active` parameter is not correctly assigned to `self.last_active` in the `__init__` method of the `Worker` class. Instead, it is directly reassigning it which results in `self.last_active` being `None` regardless of the input value.

To fix this bug, we need to correctly assign the `last_active` parameter to `self.last_active` in the `__init__` method.

Here is the corrected version of the `__init__` method:
```python
def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
    self.id = worker_id
    self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
    self.last_active = last_active if last_active is not None else time.time()  # seconds since epoch
    self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
    self.tasks = set()  # task objects
    self.info = {}
```

This correction ensures that if the `last_active` parameter is provided, it will be assigned to `self.last_active` correctly. If `last_active` is not provided, then the current time will be used for `self.last_active`.

With this correction, the test case `test_worker_prune_after_init` should now pass as expected.
