The bug in the provided function is that `last_active` parameter is not being set correctly. It is passed as a parameter to the `__init__` method but not assigned to `self.last_active` inside the function.

To fix this bug, we need to assign the `last_active` parameter to `self.last_active`.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
# The corrected version of the buggy function
def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
    self.id = worker_id
    self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
    self.last_active = last_active  # seconds since epoch
    self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
    self.tasks = set()  # task objects
    self.info = {}
```

With this change, the `last_active` parameter will now correctly set the `self.last_active` variable in the `Worker` class's constructor. This will ensure that the `last_active` value is preserved within the object as expected.

Running the failing test case `test_worker_prune_after_init` with the corrected function should now pass successfully.
