## Analysis
In the `__init__` method of the `Worker` class, the `last_active` parameter is set to `None` by default. However, in the failing test case, a `last_active` value is provided which is not being correctly assigned to `self.last_active`.

## Bug Explanation
- The bug lies in not properly assigning the `last_active` parameter to `self.last_active` in the `__init__` method of the `Worker` class. 
- As a result, the `last_active` value provided in the failing test is not being captured correctly, leading to incorrect behavior.

## Strategy for Fixing the Bug
To fix the bug, we need to modify the `__init__` method in the `Worker` class to correctly assign the provided `last_active` parameter to `self.last_active`.

## Corrected Version of the Function
```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: luigi/scheduler.py

def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
    self.id = worker_id
    self.reference = None
    self.last_active = last_active if last_active is not None else time.time()
    self.started = time.time()
    self.tasks = set()
    self.info = {}
```

After applying this correction to the `__init__` method, the provided `last_active` parameter will be assigned correctly to `self.last_active`, ensuring that the expected behavior is achieved.
