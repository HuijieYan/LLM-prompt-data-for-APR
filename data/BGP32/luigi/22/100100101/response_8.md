The bug in the provided code is that the `last_active` parameter is not being properly initialized when creating a `Worker` object. This results in the `last_active` attribute being set to `None` by default, instead of the expected value.

To fix this bug, we need to correctly assign the `last_active` parameter to the `self.last_active` attribute in the `Worker` class.

Here is the corrected version of the `__init__` function in the `Worker` class:

```python
def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
    self.id = worker_id
    self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
    self.last_active = last_active if last_active is not None else time.time()  # seconds since epoch
    self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
    self.tasks = set()  # task objects
    self.info = {}
```

This correction ensures that if a `last_active` parameter is provided during initialization, it will be used as the value for `self.last_active`. Otherwise, the current timestamp using `time.time()` will be assigned. This change will fix the bug and make the `Worker` class function as expected with the test case provided.
