## Analysis
The buggy function `__init__` is missing the `self` parameter which is essential for a class method in Python. This will cause an error when trying to set instance attributes because the method is not correctly bound to the class instance.

## Bug Cause
The bug is caused by not including the `self` parameter in the `__init__` method signature. Due to this, the instance attributes are not being set correctly and leading to unexpected behavior.

## Fix
Include the `self` parameter in the `__init__` method to ensure that the method is correctly bound to the class instance and can set its attributes as intended.

## Corrected Code
```python
# The corrected version of the buggy function
def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
    self.id = worker_id
    self.reference = None
    self.last_active = last_active if last_active is not None else time.time()
    self.started = time.time()
    self.tasks = set()
    self.info = {}
```

By adding `self` as the first parameter in the `__init__` method, the corrected function will correctly set the instance attributes when creating a new instance of the `Worker` class. This will address the bug and allow the function to behave as expected.
