The bug in the given function is that the `last_active` parameter is not being set to the provided value (`last_active`) when creating a new Worker object.

To fix this bug, we need to update the `__init__` method of the Worker class to properly initialize the `last_active` attribute with the provided value.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
class Worker:
    def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
        self.id = worker_id
        self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
        self.last_active = last_active if last_active is not None else time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        self.tasks = set()  # task objects
        self.info = {}
```

With this correction, the `last_active` attribute will be initialized with the provided value if it is not None. Otherwise, it will default to the current time.

This corrected version of the function should now pass the failing test case provided.
