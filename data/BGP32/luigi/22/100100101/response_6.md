The bug in the `__init__` function is that the `last_active` parameter is not being assigned to the instance variable `self.last_active`. Instead, it is assigning `None` to `self.last_active`. This causes the failing test case `test_worker_prune_after_init` to fail because it expects `self.last_active` to be set to a specific value.

To fix this bug, we need to update the `__init__` function to correctly assign the `last_active` parameter to `self.last_active`.

Here is the corrected version of the `__init__` function:

```python
# The corrected version of the buggy function
def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
    self.id = worker_id
    self.reference = None
    self.last_active = last_active if last_active is not None else time.time()
    self.started = time.time()
    self.tasks = set()
    self.info = {}
```

With this correction, the `__init__` function will now correctly assign the `last_active` parameter to `self.last_active` if it is provided, otherwise it will default to the current time. This will ensure that the failing test case `test_worker_prune_after_init` passes as expected.
