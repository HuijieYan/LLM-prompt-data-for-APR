The bug in the `Worker` class `__init__` function is due to the `last_active` parameter being set to `None` initially and then directly used in a comparison without checking for its `None` value.

### Issue:
When the `last_active` parameter is not provided during initialization, it defaults to `None`. In the `prune` method, `self.last_active` is attempted to be used in a comparison with `config.worker_disconnect_delay < time.time()`, resulting in a `TypeError` due to adding an `int` value with a `NoneType`.

### Fix Strategy:
To address this issue, we should check if the `last_active` parameter is `None` before comparing it with the time. If it is `None`, we can set a default value to avoid the `TypeError`.

### Corrected Version:
```python
class Worker(object):
    """
    Structure for tracking worker activity and keeping their references.
    """

    def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
        self.id = worker_id
        self.reference = None
        self.last_active = last_active if last_active is not None else time.time()  # Set default value if None
        self.started = time.time()
        self.tasks = set()
        self.info = {}
```

By incorporating the `if last_active is not None else time.time()` condition, we ensure that if `last_active` is not provided during initialization, the default value will be set to the current time, preventing the `TypeError` encountered in the failing test.
