The bug in the provided code is due to the `last_active` parameter being set as `None` by default in the `__init__` function of the `Worker` class. This results in a `TypeError` when trying to perform addition with `None` and an integer within the `prune` method.

To fix this bug, you need to handle the case where `last_active` is `None` and set a default value for `last_active` if it is not provided during initialization.

Here is the corrected version of the `__init__` function in the `Worker` class:

```python
class Worker(object):
    """
    Structure for tracking worker activity and keeping their references.
    """

    def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
        self.id = worker_id
        self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
        self.last_active = last_active if last_active is not None else time.time()  # seconds since epoch or default to current time
        self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        self.tasks = set()  # task objects
        self.info = {}
```

With this modification, the `last_active` parameter will default to the current time if not explicitly provided, ensuring that there are no `None` values in the addition operation within the `prune` method.

After applying this fix, the failing test `test_worker_prune_after_init` should pass without raising a `TypeError`.
