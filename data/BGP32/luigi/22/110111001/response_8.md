### Bug Explanation
In the `__init__` function of the `Worker` class, the `last_active` parameter is set to `None` by default. Later on, the comparison `self.last_active + config.worker_disconnect_delay < time.time()` is attempted, but `self.last_active` being `None`, it causes a `TypeError` when trying to add an integer to `None`.

### Bug Fix
To fix the bug, we need to handle the case where `last_active` is `None` before performing the comparison. One approach is to set a default value for `last_active` if it is `None`. We can use the current time as the default value in this case.

Here is the corrected version of the `__init__` function with the bug fixed:

```python
class Worker(object):
    """
    Structure for tracking worker activity and keeping their references.
    """
    
    def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
        self.id = worker_id
        self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
        self.last_active = last_active if last_active is not None else time.time()  # seconds since epoch or current time
        self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        self.tasks = set()  # task objects
        self.info = {}
```

By setting `last_active` to the current time if it is `None`, we ensure that the comparison in the `prune` function will not result in a `TypeError` due to adding an integer to `None`.
