### Bug Explanation
The bug occurs because the `last_active` parameter in the `__init__` method of the `Worker` class is set to `None` by default. Later in the code, when attempting to compare `self.last_active` (which is `None` by default) with an integer in the `prune` method, a `TypeError` is raised because you cannot perform arithmetic operations with a `NoneType`.

### Bug Fix
To fix this bug, you need to handle the case where `last_active` is `None` in the `prune` method. One way to fix this is by setting a default value for `last_active` in the `__init__` method that makes sense for comparison with integers in the `prune` method. In this case, you can set it to 0, representing the epoch time when the worker was not active.

### Corrected Version of the `Worker` class
```python
class Worker(object):
    """
    Structure for tracking worker activity and keeping their references.
    """

    def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=0):
        self.id = worker_id
        self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
        self.last_active = last_active  # seconds since epoch
        self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        self.tasks = set()  # task objects
        self.info = {}

    def prune(self, config):
        if self.last_active + config.worker_disconnect_delay < time.time():
            # perform pruning operations here
            pass
```

By setting a default value of 0 for `last_active` in the `__init__` method, the comparison in the `prune` method will work as expected and the `TypeError` will be resolved.
