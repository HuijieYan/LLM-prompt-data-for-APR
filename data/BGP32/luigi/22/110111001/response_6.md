### Bug Explanation
The bug occurs because the `last_active` parameter in the `__init__` function of the `Worker` class is set to `None` by default, but later in the code, it is used in a comparison with an integer value in the `prune` method. This leads to a `TypeError` when trying to add `None` (NoneType) with an integer value.

### Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that `last_active` is always assigned a value, preferably an integer representing the number of seconds since epoch, similar to `started`. We can modify the `__init__` method to calculate the current time if `last_active` is not provided.

### Corrected Version
```python
class Worker(object):
    """
    Structure for tracking worker activity and keeping their references.
    """

    def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
        self.id = worker_id
        self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
        self.last_active = last_active if last_active is not None else time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        self.tasks = set()  # task objects
        self.info = {}

    def prune(self, config):
        # Delete workers that haven't said anything for a while (probably killed)
        if self.last_active + config.worker_disconnect_delay < time.time():
            # Your pruning logic here
            pass
```

By checking if `last_active` is `None`, we can assign it the current time using `time.time()` if no initial value is provided. This modification should resolve the TypeError observed in the failing test.
