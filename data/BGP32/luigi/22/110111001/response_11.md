The bug in the provided `Worker` class's `__init__` function is due to the `last_active` parameter being set to `None` by default and then used in a comparison with an integer value, causing a `TypeError`.

### Cause of the bug:
- The `last_active` parameter is set to `None` by default in the `__init__` function.
- In the failing test case, when the `prune` method is called with a configuration object, it tries to compare `self.last_active` (which is `None`) with an integer value (`config.worker_disconnect_delay`).
- This comparison causes a `TypeError` as you cannot perform arithmetic operations on `None` and an integer.

### Fix strategy:
To fix this bug, we need to handle the case where `last_active` is `None` before comparing it with an integer value. We can set a default value for `last_active` if it is `None`, ensuring that it always contains a valid integer value for comparison.

### Corrected version of the `Worker` class:
```python
class Worker(object):
    """
    Structure for tracking worker activity and keeping their references.
    """
    def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
        self.id = worker_id
        self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
        self.last_active = last_active if last_active is not None else time.time()  # seconds since epoch if last_active is None
        self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        self.tasks = set()  # task objects
        self.info = {}
```

By initializing `self.last_active` with `last_active` only if it is not `None`, or else setting it to `time.time()`, we ensure that `last_active` will always have a valid integer value. This correction should resolve the `TypeError` in the failing test.
