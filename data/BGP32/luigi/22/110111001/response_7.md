### Analysis
The bug in the `Worker` class arises from the `self.last_active` parameter being initialized as `None` in the constructor. Subsequently, when the `prune()` method is called with a `config` object containing a `worker_disconnect_delay`, the comparison `self.last_active + config.worker_disconnect_delay < time.time()` throws a `TypeError` because `None` cannot be added to an integer.

### Fix Strategy
To fix this issue, we need to ensure that `self.last_active` is initialized with a default value of `0` instead of `None` in the constructor of the `Worker` class. This way, the comparison in the `prune()` method will work properly without raising a `TypeError`.

### Corrected Code
```python
import time

# Corrected version of the Worker class
class Worker(object):
    """
    Structure for tracking worker activity and keeping their references.
    """

    def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=0):
        self.id = worker_id
        self.reference = None  
        self.last_active = last_active  
        self.started = time.time()  
        self.tasks = set()  
        self.info = {}
    
    def prune(self, config):
        # Delete workers that haven't said anything for a while (probably killed)
        if self.last_active + config.worker_disconnect_delay < time.time():
            # Add logic here for pruning workers
            pass
``` 

Now, with `last_active` initialized as `0`, the comparison in the `prune()` method will work as intended without causing a `TypeError` due to adding `None`.
