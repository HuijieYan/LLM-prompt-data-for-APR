The bug in the `Worker` class's `__init__` function arises from the usage of `None` as the default value for the `last_active` parameter, which causes a `TypeError` when trying to perform addition with `time.time()`.

### Explanation of the bug:
- The `__init__` function of the `Worker` class initializes the `last_active` attribute with a default value of `None`.
- When the `prune` method is called in the failing test, it tries to check if `self.last_active + config.worker_disconnect_delay` is less than the current time (`time.time()`).
- Since `self.last_active` is initialized as `None`, attempting to perform addition with an integer value (representing time) raises a `TypeError`.

### Strategy for fixing the bug:
- Initialize `last_active` with an integer value representing the time of initialization rather than `None` to avoid the `TypeError`.
- Update the `__init__` function to handle the default value for `last_active` by assigning the current time if no value is provided.

### Updated version of the `__init__` function in the `Worker` class:
```python
def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
    self.id = worker_id
    self.reference = None
    self.last_active = last_active if last_active is not None else time.time()
    self.started = time.time()
    self.tasks = set()
    self.info = {}
```

By making this adjustment in the `__init__` function, the `last_active` attribute will be initialized with the current time if no value is provided, preventing the `TypeError` during addition.
