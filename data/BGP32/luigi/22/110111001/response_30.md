### Analysis
- The `Worker` class has an `__init__` method that initializes the attributes of a worker object.
- The `last_active` parameter in the `__init__` method can be `None`.
- The error occurs when trying to add `None` (the initial value of `last_active`) with an integer in the `prune` method.
- The failing test is trying to create a `Worker` object and then call the `prune` method on it with a configuration object.
- The error message indicates a `TypeError` due to trying to add `NoneType` and `int`.

### Bug Cause
The bug is caused by comparing `None` (initial value of `last_active`) with an integer in the `prune` method, leading to a `TypeError`.

### Fix Strategy
Ensure that the `last_active` value is not `None` while performing arithmetic operations in the `prune` method.

### Corrected Code
```python
class Worker(object):
    """
    Structure for tracking worker activity and keeping their references.
    """

    def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
        self.id = worker_id
        self.reference = None
        self.last_active = last_active if last_active is not None else time.time()  # If last_active is None, set it to current time
        self.started = time.time()
        self.tasks = set()
        self.info = {}

    def prune(self, config):
        if self.last_active + config.worker_disconnect_delay < time.time():
            # Your pruning logic here
```

By modifying the initialization of `last_active` in the `__init__` method to set it to the current time if it is `None`, the bug is fixed.
