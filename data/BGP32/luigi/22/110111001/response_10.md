### Bug Explanation
The bug occurs due to the `last_active` parameter being initialized as `None` in the `__init__` method of the `Worker` class. When attempting to perform arithmetic operations with `None`, it throws a `TypeError` since `None` is not a valid operand for addition.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to handle the case where `last_active` is `None` and provide a default value for it to avoid the `TypeError`. We can initialize it with the current time when it is `None`.

### Corrected Version of the Buggy Function
```python
class Worker(object):
    """
    Structure for tracking worker activity and keeping their references.
    """

    def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
        self.id = worker_id
        self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
        self.last_active = last_active if last_active is not None else time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        self.tasks = set()  # task objects
        self.info = {}
``` 

By initializing `last_active` with the current time if it is `None`, we prevent the `TypeError` from occurring when performing arithmetic operations. This fix should resolve the issue and make the test pass successfully.
