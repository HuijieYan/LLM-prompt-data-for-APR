The bug in the provided function `__init__` arises due to the optional parameter `last_active` being set to `None`. When the method `prune` is called on an instance of the `Worker` class with this `None` value, it leads to a `TypeError` because `None` cannot be added with an integer (specifically `config.worker_disconnect_delay`) in the comparison.

The strategy for fixing this bug is to ensure that if `last_active` is provided as `None`, it should be handled correctly within the `prune` method.

Here is the corrected version of the `Worker` class with a fixed `__init__` method:

```python
class Worker(object):
    """
    Structure for tracking worker activity and keeping their references.
    """

    def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
        self.id = worker_id
        self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
        self.last_active = last_active if last_active is not None else time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        self.tasks = set()  # task objects
        self.info = {}

    def prune(self, config):
        # Delete workers that haven't said anything for a while (probably killed)
        if self.last_active + config.worker_disconnect_delay < time.time():
            pass  # implementation of prune method
```

With this change, if `last_active` is provided as `None`, it will be initialized with the current time when creating an instance of the `Worker` class, preventing the `TypeError` in the `prune` method.
