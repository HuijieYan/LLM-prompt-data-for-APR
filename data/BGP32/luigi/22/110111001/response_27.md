### 3. Explanation
The buggy function `__init__` of the `Worker` class in the `luigi.scheduler` module initializes a worker object with provided `worker_id` and optional `last_active` time. However, the issue arises from the fact that if `last_active` is not provided, it defaults to `None`, causing a `TypeError` when trying to compare `None` with an integer in the `prune` method.

### 4. Bug Fix Strategy
To fix this bug, we need to ensure that `last_active` is properly initialized with the current time in seconds since epoch if it is not provided when creating a new worker object.

### Corrected Version
```python
class Worker(object):
    """
    Structure for tracking worker activity and keeping their references.
    """

    def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
        self.id = worker_id
        self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
        self.last_active = last_active if last_active is not None else time.time()  # seconds since epoch or current time if not provided
        self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        self.tasks = set()  # task objects
        self.info = {}
```

By modifying the `__init__` method as shown above, we ensure that `last_active` is initialized with the current time if it is not explicitly provided, thus avoiding the `TypeError` when comparing it with an integer in the `prune` method.
