The issue in the buggy function `__init__()` is that the `last_active` parameter is passed as `None`, and later in the function, it is used in a comparison without checking if it's None. This results in a `TypeError` when trying to perform addition with `None` and an integer.

To fix this bug, we need to handle the case when `last_active` is `None` and provide a default value for comparison. One common approach is to set a default value for `last_active` if it is None.

Here is the corrected version of the `__init__()` function:

```python
class Worker(object):
    """
    Structure for tracking worker activity and keeping their references.
    """

    def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
        self.id = worker_id
        self.reference = None
        self.last_active = last_active if last_active is not None else time.time()  # Set default value if last_active is None
        self.started = time.time()
        self.tasks = set()
        self.info = {}
```

This fix ensures that if `last_active` is None, it defaults to the current time when making the comparison, preventing the `TypeError` that was occurring before.

After applying this fix, the provided failing test `test_worker_prune_after_init` should pass without any issues.
