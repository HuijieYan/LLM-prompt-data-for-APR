### Analysis
The error occurs in the `prune` method of the `Worker` class due to the `last_active` attribute being initialized as `None` in the `__init__` method. When the `prune` method tries to add `config.worker_disconnect_delay` to `self.last_active`, it encounters a `TypeError` because adding an integer to `None` is not supported.

### Bug Cause
The bug is caused by the `last_active` attribute being initialized as `None` in the `__init__` method of the `Worker` class, leading to a `TypeError` when trying to perform arithmetic operations with `None`.

### Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to provide a default value for `last_active` in case it is not explicitly passed during object initialization. We can use the `time.time()` function to set the default value to the current time in seconds since the epoch.

### Corrected Code
```python
# The corrected version of the buggy function
class Worker(object):
    """
    Structure for tracking worker activity and keeping their references.
    """
    def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
        self.id = worker_id
        self.reference = None
        self.last_active = last_active if last_active is not None else time.time()
        self.started = time.time()
        self.tasks = set()
        self.info = {}
```

By setting the default value of `last_active` to the current time in seconds since the epoch if it is `None`, we ensure that it is always an integer and avoid the `TypeError` when performing arithmetic operations in the `prune` method.
