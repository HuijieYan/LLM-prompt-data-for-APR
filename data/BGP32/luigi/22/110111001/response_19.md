The bug in the `Worker` class `__init__` function arises from the fact that the `last_active` parameter is set to default as `None`, causing a `TypeError: unsupported operand type(s) for +: 'NoneType' and 'int'` when trying to add `None` to an integer in the `prune` method.

### Cause of the Bug:
The bug occurs because the `self.last_active` is being compared with `time.time()` (an integer) without checking if it is `None`.

### Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we should ensure that `self.last_active` is set to the current time if no value is provided during initialization of the `Worker` instance.

### Corrected Version:
```python
class Worker(object):
    """
    Structure for tracking worker activity and keeping their references.
    """

    def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
        self.id = worker_id
        self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
        self.last_active = last_active if last_active else time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        self.tasks = set()  # task objects
        self.info = {}

    def prune(self, config):
        if self.last_active + config.worker_disconnect_delay < time.time():
            # Prune tasks
            pass  # Placeholder for additional pruning logic
```

By setting `self.last_active` to `time.time()` if no value is provided, we avoid the `TypeError` raised in the `prune` method when comparing the last active time with the current time.
