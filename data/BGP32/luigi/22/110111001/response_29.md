The bug in the `Worker` class `__init__` method is caused by the `last_active` parameter being set to `None` by default, which leads to a `TypeError` when trying to add an integer to a `NoneType` in the `prune` method.

### Bug Explanation:
- In the failing test, the `Worker` instance is created with `worker = luigi.scheduler.Worker(123)`, where the `last_active` parameter defaults to `None`.
- The failing line `if self.last_active + config.worker_disconnect_delay < time.time():` is attempting to add an integer value (`config.worker_disconnect_delay`) to `self.last_active`, which is `None`, causing the `TypeError`.

### Bug Fix:
To fix this bug, we need to ensure that if the `last_active` parameter is not provided during initialization, a default value should be set to avoid `NoneType` errors.

### Corrected Version:
```python
class Worker(object):
    """
    Structure for tracking worker activity and keeping their references.
    """

    def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
        self.id = worker_id
        self.reference = None
        self.last_active = last_active if last_active is not None else time.time()
        self.started = time.time()
        self.tasks = set()
        self.info = {}
```

By setting `self.last_active` to `time.time()` if `last_active` is `None`, the corrected version ensures that a valid timestamp is always used, avoiding the `TypeError` in the `prune` method.
