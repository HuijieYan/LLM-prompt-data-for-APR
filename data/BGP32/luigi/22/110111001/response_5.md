### Analysis
1. The error occurs in the `prune` method of the `Worker` class due to the `self.last_active` being initialized as `None` in the `__init__` method.
2. The error message indicates that Python cannot perform the operation `self.last_active + config.worker_disconnect_delay` because `self.last_active` is of type `None`.
3. The failing test `test_worker_prune_after_init` tries to create a `Worker` object with `worker_id` of `123` and then calls the `prune` method on it.
4. To fix the bug, we need to handle the case where `last_active` is `None` gracefully and possibly set a default value.
5. Modify the `__init__` method to handle the `last_active` parameter properly.

### Correction
```python
class Worker(object):
    """
    Structure for tracking worker activity and keeping their references.
    """

    def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
        self.id = worker_id
        self.reference = None
        self.last_active = last_active if last_active is not None else time.time()  # Default to current time if last_active is None
        self.started = time.time()
        self.tasks = set()
        self.info = {}
```

By updating the `__init__` method to set a default value for `last_active` if it is `None`, we ensure that the operation in the `prune` method will not raise a `TypeError`. This correction should allow the `test_worker_prune_after_init` test to pass successfully.
