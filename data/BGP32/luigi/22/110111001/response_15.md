### Bug Explanation
The bug occurs in the `prune` method of the `Worker` class where there is an attempt to add a `NoneType` (`self.last_active` is initialized as `None`) and an `int` (`config.worker_disconnect_delay`) in the comparison with `time.time()`. This leads to a `TypeError` during runtime.

### Fix Strategy
To fix this bug, we need to handle the case where `last_active` is `None` before comparing it with `config.worker_disconnect_delay`.

### The corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
class Worker(object):
    """
    Structure for tracking worker activity and keeping their references.
    """

    def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
        self.id = worker_id
        self.reference = None
        self.last_active = last_active
        self.started = time.time()
        self.tasks = set()
        self.info = {}

    def prune(self, config):
        if self.last_active is not None and self.last_active + config.worker_disconnect_delay < time.time():
            # Perform pruning operations here
            pass
```
