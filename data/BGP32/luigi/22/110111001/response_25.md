The issue in the buggy function `__init__` arises from the fact that the `last_active` parameter has a default value of `None`, and in the comparison `(self.last_active + config.worker_disconnect_delay < time.time())`, Python is trying to add `None` (self.last_active) to an integer (`config.worker_disconnect_delay`). This results in a `TypeError`.

To fix this issue, we need to handle the case where `last_active` is `None` separately. We can set a default value for `last_active` to `0` if it is not provided during initialization.

Below is the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
class Worker(object):
    """
    Structure for tracking worker activity and keeping their references.
    """

    def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
        self.id = worker_id
        self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
        self.last_active = last_active if last_active is not None else 0  # seconds since epoch, defaulting to 0 if last_active is None
        self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        self.tasks = set()  # task objects
        self.info = {}
```

By setting a default value of `0` for `last_active` when it is not provided, we ensure that the comparison will always involve integer values and not `None`, resolving the `TypeError` issue identified in the failing test.
