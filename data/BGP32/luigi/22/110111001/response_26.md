The bug in the `Worker` class `__init__` function arises from the fact that the `last_active` parameter is set to `None` by default, causing a `TypeError` when trying to add it to an integer (`time.time()`). This issue occurs when trying to prune workers based on their last active time.

To fix this bug, we need to handle the case where `last_active` is `None` by initializing it with a suitable default value before performing arithmetic operations with it.

Here is the corrected version of the `__init__` function:

```python
import time

class Worker(object):
    """
    Structure for tracking worker activity and keeping their references.
    """

    def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
        self.id = worker_id
        self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
        self.last_active = last_active if last_active is not None else time.time()  # seconds since epoch or current time
        self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        self.tasks = set()  # task objects
        self.info = {}
```

By initializing `last_active` with the current time if it is `None`, we prevent the `TypeError` when performing the comparison with `config.worker_disconnect_delay`.

This correction should resolve the issue and allow the failing test to pass successfully.
