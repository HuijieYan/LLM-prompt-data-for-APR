The bug in the `Worker` class initialization arises from the `last_active` parameter being set to `None` by default and then used in a comparison operation in the `prune` method with an integer. This results in a `TypeError` where the addition operation (`+`) cannot be performed between a `NoneType` and an `int`.

To fix this bug, we can provide a default value for `last_active` in the `__init__` method of the `Worker` class. By setting a default value of `0` (indicating the worker was last active at epoch time 0), we ensure the comparison in the `prune` method will function correctly.

Here's the corrected version of the `__init__` method in the `Worker` class:

```python
def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=0):
    self.id = worker_id
    self.reference = None
    self.last_active = last_active
    self.started = time.time()
    self.tasks = set()
    self.info = {}
```

With this correction, the `worker.prune` method should work correctly without raising a `TypeError`.
