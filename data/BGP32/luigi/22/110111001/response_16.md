The bug in the provided function is due to the `last_active` parameter being set to `None` by default in the `__init__` method, causing a `TypeError` when trying to add an integer value to `None` during pruning.

To fix this bug, we need to handle the case when `last_active` is `None` and set it to `time.time()` instead. This will ensure that the comparison in the `prune` method can be performed correctly without raising an error.

Here is the corrected version of the `__init__` method:

```python
    def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
        self.id = worker_id
        self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
        self.last_active = last_active if last_active is not None else time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        self.tasks = set()  # task objects
        self.info = {}
```

By updating the initialization of `last_active` with `time.time()` only when `last_active` is `None`, we prevent the `TypeError` from occurring during the `prune` method execution.

This correction should enable the failing test case `test_worker_prune_after_init` to pass successfully.
