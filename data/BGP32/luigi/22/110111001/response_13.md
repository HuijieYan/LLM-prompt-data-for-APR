### Analysis
The issue in the `__init__` method of the `Worker` class arises from the fact that `last_active` is being set to `None`, causing a `TypeError` when trying to add an integer (config.worker_disconnect_delay) to it. 

### Bug Explanation
1. In the `Worker` class, the `__init__` method initializes `last_active` with a default value of `None`.
2. When the `prune` method is called on a `Worker` instance, it tries to add `config.worker_disconnect_delay` (an integer representing the delay) to `last_active`, which is `None`.
3. This addition operation results in a `TypeError` since you cannot add an integer to `None`.

### Bug Fix
To fix this issue, we need to ensure that `last_active` is either initialized with a valid timestamp or handle `None` values appropriately in the `prune` method. One solution is to set `last_active` to the current time in seconds if no value is provided.

### Corrected Code
```python
class Worker(object):
    """
    Structure for tracking worker activity and keeping their references.
    """

    def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
        self.id = worker_id
        self.reference = None
        self.last_active = last_active if last_active is not None else time.time()  # Initialize to current time if None
        self.started = time.time()
        self.tasks = set()
        self.info = {}
```
