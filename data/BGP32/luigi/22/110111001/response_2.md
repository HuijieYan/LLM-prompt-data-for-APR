### Explanation:
The bug occurs because the `last_active` parameter in the `__init__` method of the `Worker` class is set to `None` by default, and when the `prune` method is called, it tries to add an integer (`config.worker_disconnect_delay`) to this `None` value causing a `TypeError`.

### Fix strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to handle the case where `last_active` is `None` in the `prune` method. We can do this by setting a default value for `last_active` in the `__init__` method if it is `None`. This way, when `prune` method is called, `last_active` will have an integer value to perform the comparison.

### The corrected version of the buggy function:
```python
class Worker(object):
    """
    Structure for tracking worker activity and keeping their references.
    """

    def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
        self.id = worker_id
        self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
        self.last_active = last_active if last_active is not None else time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        self.tasks = set()  # task objects
        self.info = {}

    def prune(self, config):
        # Delete workers that haven't said anything for a while (probably killed)
        if self.last_active + config.worker_disconnect_delay < time.time():
            # Perform pruning here
            pass
``` 

By setting the default value of `last_active` in the `__init__` method to `time.time()` if it's `None`, we ensure that `last_active` always has a valid value for comparisons in the `prune` method. This corrected version should now pass the failing test.
