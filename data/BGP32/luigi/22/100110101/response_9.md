To fix the bug in the `__init__` method of the `Worker` class, we need to ensure that the `last_active` parameter is initialized with the provided value if it is not None. 

Here is the corrected version of the `__init__` method:

```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: luigi/scheduler.py

# corrected version of the __init__ method
def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
    self.id = worker_id
    self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
    if last_active is not None:
        self.last_active = last_active
    else:
        self.last_active = time.time()
    self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
    self.tasks = set()  # task objects
    self.info = {}
```

This correction ensures that `self.last_active` is initialized with the provided `last_active` value if it is not None. If `last_active` is None, it defaults to the current time using `time.time()`.

With this correction, the function should now properly handle the initialization of `last_active` and avoid the TypeError encountered in the failing test case.
