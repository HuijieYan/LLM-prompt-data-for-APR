The bug in the `__init__` function arises from the fact that the `last_active` parameter can be `None`, which causes a `TypeError` when trying to add it to an integer value in the `prune` method. To fix this bug, we need to handle the case where `last_active` is `None` and provide a default value for it.

Here is the corrected version of the `__init__` function:

```python
def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
    self.id = worker_id
    self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
    self.last_active = last_active if last_active is not None else time.time()  # seconds since epoch
    self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
    self.tasks = set()  # task objects
    self.info = {}
```

With this correction, if `last_active` is not provided, it defaults to the current time using `time.time()`. This ensures that the `prune` method can work with the `last_active` variable without causing a `TypeError`.
