To fix the bug in the `__init__` function of the `Worker` class, we need to address the issue of `last_active` being set to `None` and causing a `TypeError` when trying to add it to an integer in the `prune` method.

The strategy to fix this bug is to provide a default value for `last_active` in case it is not provided during initialization of a `Worker` instance. By setting `last_active` to the current time in seconds since epoch if it is not provided, we can ensure that it will always be a valid value to perform arithmetic operations with.

Here is the corrected version of the `__init__` function:

```python
def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
    self.id = worker_id
    self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
    self.last_active = last_active if last_active is not None else time.time()  # seconds since epoch
    self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
    self.tasks = set()  # task objects
    self.info = {}
```

This correction ensures that `last_active` is always initialized with a valid value and prevents the `TypeError` when performing arithmetic operations in the `prune` method.
