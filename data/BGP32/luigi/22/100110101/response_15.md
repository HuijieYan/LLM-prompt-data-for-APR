The bug in the `__init__` function of the `Worker` class is due to `last_active` being set to `None`, which causes the TypeError when trying to add it to an integer (`config.worker_disconnect_delay`). To fix this bug, we need to handle the case when `last_active` is None and initialize it appropriately.

Here is the corrected version of the `__init__` function:

```python
# Fixed version of the buggy function
def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
    self.id = worker_id
    self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
    
    # Fix for the bug
    if last_active is not None:
        self.last_active = last_active  # seconds since epoch
    else:
        self.last_active = time.time()
    
    self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
    self.tasks = set()  # task objects
    self.info = {}
```

With this fix, the `last_active` variable is initialized to the current time if it is passed as None. This change ensures that the calculations involving `last_active` and `time.time()` will work correctly without raising a TypeError.

By applying this fix, the `Worker` class should now be able to handle the case where `last_active` is None and pass the failing test case described above.
