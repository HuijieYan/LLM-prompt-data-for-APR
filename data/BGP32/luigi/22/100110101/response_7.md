To fix the bug in the `__init__` method of the `Worker` class, we need to ensure that `last_active` is initialized to a default value if no value is provided when creating a new `Worker` instance. Currently, when `last_active` is not provided, it defaults to `None` which causes the TypeError when trying to add an integer to `None`.

Here is the corrected version of the `__init__` method:

```python
def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
    self.id = worker_id
    self.reference = None
    self.last_active = last_active if last_active is not None else time.time()
    self.started = time.time()
    self.tasks = set()
    self.info = {}
```

With this correction, if `last_active` is not provided during the creation of a new `Worker` instance, it will default to the current time in seconds since epoch. This will prevent the TypeError that was occurring when trying to add an integer to `None`.

This correction ensures that the `__init__` method of the `Worker` class works correctly and passes the failing test case. The expected values and types of variables at the function's return will match the provided expected values from the test case.
