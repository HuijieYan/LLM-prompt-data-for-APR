## Correction

The issue in the provided `__init__` function is that the `last_active` parameter is set to `None`, causing a `TypeError` when trying to add it to an integer (`time.time()`). To correct this, we need to handle the case where `last_active` is `None` and assign a default value to it.

Below is the corrected version of the `__init__` function:

```python
def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
    self.id = worker_id
    self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
    self.last_active = last_active if last_active is not None else time.time()  # seconds since epoch or default to current time
    self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
    self.tasks = set()  # task objects
    self.info = {}
```

With this correction, the `last_active` parameter will default to the current time if not provided, preventing the `TypeError` in the `prune` method.

This correction ensures that the `last_active` parameter will be properly initialized to either the value provided or the current time, fixing the issue identified by the failing test scenario.
