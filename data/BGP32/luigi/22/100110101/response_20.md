To fix the bug in the `__init__` function of the `Worker` class, we need to address the issue of `last_active` being potentially `None`. The error occurs when trying to add `None` to an integer in the `prune` method. To fix this, we can provide a default value for `last_active` in the `__init__` method.

### Corrected version of the buggy function
```python
def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
    self.id = worker_id
    self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
    self.last_active = last_active if last_active is not None else time.time()  # seconds since epoch if None is provided
    self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
    self.tasks = set()  # task objects
    self.info = {}
```

By checking if `last_active` is `None`, we assign the current time using `time.time()` to it in the `__init__` method. This change ensures that `last_active` will always have a valid timestamp to prevent the `TypeError` when used in the `prune` method.

With this correction, the `Worker` class should now initialize correctly and allow the test case `test_worker_prune_after_init` to pass as expected.
