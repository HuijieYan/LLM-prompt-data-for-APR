### Analysis
The bug occurs due to the `last_active` parameter being initialized as `None` in the `__init__` function of the `Worker` class. When trying to compare `None` with an integer in the `prune` method, it results in a `TypeError` since you can't perform addition operations between `None` and an integer.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to handle the case where `last_active` is `None` in the `prune` method of the `Worker` class. We can initialize `last_active` with a default value if it is `None` in the `__init__` method. 

### The corrected version of the buggy function
```python
def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
    self.id = worker_id
    self.reference = None
    self.last_active = last_active if last_active is not None else time.time()  # Initialize with current time if last_active is None
    self.started = time.time()
    self.tasks = set()
    self.info = {}
```

After applying this fix, the `last_active` will be initialized with the current time if it is `None`, preventing the TypeError when comparing it with an integer in the `prune` method.

This corrected version should pass the failing test case provided.
