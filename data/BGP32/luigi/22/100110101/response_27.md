### Corrected version of the buggy function

```python
def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
    self.id = worker_id
    self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
    if last_active is not None:
        self.last_active = last_active  # seconds since epoch
    else:
        self.last_active = time.time()  # seconds since epoch if last_active is not provided
    self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
    self.tasks = set()  # task objects
    self.info = {}
```

By adding a check to see if `last_active` is `None`, we can set `self.last_active` to the current time `time.time()` if it is not provided during initialization. This will prevent the `NoneType` error when trying to add an integer value to `None`.
