Based on the provided information, the issue stems from the fact that the `last_active` parameter is set to `None` by default in the `__init__` function of the `Worker` class. This leads to a `TypeError` when trying to add `config.worker_disconnect_delay` to `None`.

To fix this issue, we can set a default value for `last_active` in the `__init__` function of the `Worker` class.

Here is the corrected version of the `__init__` function:

```python
# The corrected version of the __init__ function
def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
    self.id = worker_id
    self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
    self.last_active = last_active if last_active is not None else time.time()  # seconds since epoch
    self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
    self.tasks = set()  # task objects
    self.info = {}
```

By implementing this change, the `last_active` parameter will default to the current time (using `time.time()`) if no value is provided, preventing any `TypeError` when performing calculations with it.

This corrected version should address the bug and allow the failing test to pass successfully.
