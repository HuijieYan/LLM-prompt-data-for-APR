To fix the bug in the `__init__` method of the `Worker` class in the `luigi.scheduler.py` file, we need to address the issue where `last_active` is initialized to `None` and then used in an addition operation without proper handling.

### Cause of the Bug:
The bug occurs because when `last_active` is initialized as `None`, it cannot be used in an arithmetic operation when calculating if a worker should be pruned based on `worker_disconnect_delay`.

### Fix Strategy:
We need to handle the case where `last_active` is `None` by providing a default value when performing the arithmetic operation for pruning workers.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
    self.id = worker_id
    self.reference = None
    self.last_active = last_active if last_active is not None else time.time()  # Use current time if last_active is None
    self.started = time.time()
    self.tasks = set()
    self.info = {}

```

After making this correction, the `Worker` class should handle the case where `last_active` is `None` and use the current time in such scenarios. This modification ensures that the comparison in the `prune` method will work correctly.

By applying this change, the `Worker` class instantiation in the failing test will not result in a `TypeError`, and the test `test_worker_prune_after_init` should pass successfully.
