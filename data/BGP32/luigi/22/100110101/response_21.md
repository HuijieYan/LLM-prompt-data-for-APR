To fix the bug in the `__init__` function of the `Worker` class, we need to handle the case where the `last_active` parameter is `None` properly. The error occurs because we cannot add an `int` to a `NoneType` in the line `if self.last_active + config.worker_disconnect_delay < time.time():`.

We can fix this by setting a default value for `last_active` if it is not provided during initialization. Let's modify the `__init__` function to handle this scenario:

```python
def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
    self.id = worker_id
    self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
    self.last_active = last_active if last_active is not None else time.time()  # seconds since epoch or current time if last_active is None
    self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
    self.tasks = set()  # task objects
    self.info = {}
```

This modification ensures that if `last_active` is not provided, it defaults to the current time using `time.time()`. This will prevent the `NoneType` error when doing arithmetic operations.

By making this change, the `__init__` function should now properly handle the `last_active` parameter and the test case `test_worker_prune_after_init` should pass without any errors.
