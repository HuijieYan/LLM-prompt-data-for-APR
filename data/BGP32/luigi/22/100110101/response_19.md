The issue in the provided buggy function is related to the `last_active` parameter being set as `None` by default. This leads to a `TypeError` when trying to add an integer value to `None` in the prune function.

To fix this issue, we can modify the `__init__` function to handle the case where `last_active` is not provided. We can set a default value for `last_active` to `None` and then check if it is `None` before performing any arithmetic operations in the `prune` function.

Here is the corrected version of the `__init__` function:

```python
def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
    self.id = worker_id
    self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
    self.last_active = last_active if last_active is not None else time.time()  # seconds since epoch if last_active is None
    self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
    self.tasks = set()  # task objects
    self.info = {}
```

With this modification, we ensure that if `last_active` is not provided, it defaults to the current time in seconds since epoch.

Now, when the `prune` function is called with the test case provided, it will not throw a `TypeError` and will work as expected.

Hope this helps!
