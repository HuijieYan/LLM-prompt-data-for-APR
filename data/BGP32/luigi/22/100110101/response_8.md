The bug occurs because the `last_active` parameter is set to `None` by default in the `__init__` function, and this is causing a `TypeError` when trying to add `None` to an integer in the `prune` method. To fix this issue, we need to make sure that `last_active` is always a float value.

Here is the corrected version of the `__init__` function:

```python
def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
    self.id = worker_id
    self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
    self.last_active = last_active if last_active is not None else time.time()  # seconds since epoch
    self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
    self.tasks = set()  # task objects
    self.info = {}
```

By checking if `last_active` is `None` when initializing the object, we set it to the current time using `time.time()` if that's the case.

This fix ensures that `last_active` will always have a valid float value, preventing the `TypeError` when performing operations on it.

After applying this correction, the function should pass the failing test case with the expected input and output values as described.
