The bug in the provided `__init__` function of the `luigi.scheduler.Worker` class is that the `last_active` parameter is set to `None` initially, causing a `TypeError` when trying to access it in the `prune` method. The error occurs because `None` cannot be added to an integer value in the conditional check.

To fix this bug, we need to initialize `self.last_active` with the provided `last_active` value if it is not `None`, or with the current time if it is `None`. This way, we ensure that `last_active` is always set to a valid numeric value.

Here is the corrected version of the `__init__` function:

```python
# The corrected version of the buggy function
def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
    self.id = worker_id
    self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
    
    if last_active is not None:
        self.last_active = last_active
    else:
        self.last_active = time.time()
    
    self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
    self.tasks = set()  # task objects
    self.info = {}
```

With this correction, the `last_active` parameter is properly initialized based on the provided value or the current time. This change ensures that the `prune` method can safely compare `self.last_active` with the current time without raising a `TypeError`.

Now, when the `test_worker_prune_after_init` test is executed, the corrected `Worker` initialization function will set `last_active` to the current time, making the test pass successfully.
