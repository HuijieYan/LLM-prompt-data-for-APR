The bug in the provided code is due to the `last_active` parameter having a default value of `None`, which causes a `TypeError` when attempting to add it to an integer (`config.worker_disconnect_delay`) in the `prune` method of the `Worker` class.

To fix this bug, we need to handle the case where `last_active` is `None` in the `__init__` method and assign a default value of `0` instead. This will ensure that the addition operation in the `prune` method works correctly.

Here is the corrected version of the `__init__` method in the `Worker` class:

```python
def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
    self.id = worker_id
    self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
    self.last_active = last_active if last_active is not None else 0  # seconds since epoch or default to 0
    self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
    self.tasks = set()  # task objects
    self.info = {}
```

With this correction, the `prune` method should now work correctly without raising a `TypeError`.

Please replace the `__init__` method in your `luigi/scheduler.py` file with the corrected version provided above. The failing test case `test_worker_prune_after_init` should now pass successfully.
