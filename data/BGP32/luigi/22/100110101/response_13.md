The issue in the buggy function is that it initializes `self.last_active` as `None`, which causes a `TypeError` when trying to add an integer value to `None` in the `prune` method.

To fix this issue, we need to ensure that `self.last_active` is set to `last_active` if it is provided during initialization. If not provided, we can set it to `time.time()` to represent the current time when the worker is created.

Here is the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
    self.id = worker_id
    self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
    
    if last_active is not None:
        self.last_active = last_active
    else:
        self.last_active = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
    
    self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
    self.tasks = set()  # task objects
    self.info = {}
```

With this correction, the function will initialize `self.last_active` to the provided value if it exists, or to the current time if no value is provided. This change ensures that the `prune` method won't encounter a `TypeError` when performing arithmetic operations on `self.last_active`.

By applying this fix, the function should pass the failing test and satisfy the expected input/output values.
