The bug in the provided code is due to the `last_active` parameter being set to `None` initially, but then being used in an arithmetic operation without checking if it's `None` or not. The error occurs because `None` cannot be directly added to an integer.

To fix this bug, we need to check if `last_active` is `None` before performing any arithmetic operation involving it. If it's `None`, we can set `last_active` to the current time.

Here is the corrected version of the `__init__` function:

```python
def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
    self.id = worker_id
    self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
    self.last_active = last_active if last_active is not None else time.time()  # seconds since epoch
    self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
    self.tasks = set()  # task objects
    self.info = {}
```

With this fix, the `last_active` parameter is checked for `None` before being used in any arithmetic operation, ensuring that the code does not throw a `TypeError` when `last_active` is `None`.

This corrected version should now pass the failing test case provided.
