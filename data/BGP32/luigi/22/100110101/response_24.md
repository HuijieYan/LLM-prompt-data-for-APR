To fix the bug in the `__init__` method of the `Worker` class, we need to handle the case when `last_active` is `None`. The error occurs because we are trying to add `None` to an integer in the comparison inside the `prune` method.

Here is the corrected version of the `__init__` method:

```python
def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
    self.id = worker_id
    self.reference = None
    self.last_active = last_active if last_active is not None else time.time()  # Initialize last_active with current time if None
    self.started = time.time()
    self.tasks = set()
    self.info = {}
```

This fix ensures that if `last_active` is not provided, it defaults to the current time. Now, the `Worker` object can be initialized correctly and the error in the `prune` method should be resolved.
