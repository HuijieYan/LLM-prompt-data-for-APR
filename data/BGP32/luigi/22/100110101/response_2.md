### Strategy for fixing the bug
The error message indicates that the `last_active` attribute of the `Worker` class is initialized as `None` and later an addition operation is attempted with `None` and an integer value. To fix this bug, the `last_active` attribute should be assigned the provided `last_active` value if it is not `None` during initialization.

### Corrected version of the buggy function
```python
def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
    self.id = worker_id
    self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
    self.last_active = last_active if last_active is not None else time.time()  # seconds since epoch if not provided
    self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
    self.tasks = set()  # task objects
    self.info = {}
```
