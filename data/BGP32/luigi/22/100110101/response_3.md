### Fixing the buggy function

#### Analysis:
The error occurs because the `last_active` parameter is being passed as `None` in the `__init__` function of the `Worker` class, leading to a `TypeError` when trying to add an integer value to `None`.

#### Strategy for fixing:
To fix the bug, we need to handle the case where `last_active` is `None` by assigning a default value in case it is not provided.

#### Corrected version of the buggy function:
```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: luigi/scheduler.py

def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
    self.id = worker_id
    self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
    self.last_active = last_active if last_active is not None else time.time()  # seconds since epoch
    self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
    self.tasks = set()  # task objects
    self.info = {}
```

By making this change, the `last_active` parameter is checked for `None` and assigned the current time using `time.time()` if it is `None`. This ensures that the code does not throw a `TypeError` when trying to add an integer to `None`.
