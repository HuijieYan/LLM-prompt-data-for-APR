To fix the issue in the `__init__` method of the `Worker` class, we need to ensure that we handle the case where the `last_active` parameter is `None`. The error occurs because the code is trying to add `None` (the default value of `last_active`) to an integer (config.worker_disconnect_delay) in the `prune` method, resulting in a `TypeError`.

To fix this bug, we can modify the `__init__` method to check if `last_active` is `None` and assign the current time in seconds since epoch if it is. Here is the corrected version of the code:

```python
import time

def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
    self.id = worker_id
    self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
    self.last_active = last_active if last_active is not None else time.time()  # seconds since epoch
    self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
    self.tasks = set()  # task objects
    self.info = {}
```

This modification ensures that if `last_active` is `None`, it will be assigned the current time in seconds since epoch, preventing the TypeError when trying to add it to an integer in the `prune` method.

With this correction, the `Worker` class's `__init__` method will now correctly handle the default value of `last_active` and ensure that the `prune` method can be called without resulting in a TypeError.
