The bug in the provided code is due to the `last_active` parameter being set to `None` by default, causing a `TypeError` when trying to add an integer value to `None` in the `prune` method.

To fix this bug, we need to ensure that if `last_active` is not provided during object initialization, a default value should be used instead of `None`.

Here is the corrected version of the `__init__` method in the `luigi/scheduler.py` file:

```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: luigi/scheduler.py

def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
    self.id = worker_id
    self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
    self.last_active = last_active if last_active is not None else time.time()  # seconds since epoch or current time
    self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
    self.tasks = set()  # task objects
    self.info = {}
```

By incorporating the conditional statement to check whether `last_active` is `None` during object initialization, we ensure that a default value of `time.time()` will be used in case `last_active` is not provided explicitly. This correction should resolve the `TypeError` issue identified in the failing test.
