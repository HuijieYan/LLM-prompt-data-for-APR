To fix the bug in the `__init__` function of the `Worker` class, we need to ensure that `last_active` is not `None` when used in the calculation for pruning workers. We can assign a default value to `last_active` if it is not provided.

Here is the corrected version of the `Worker` class constructor:

```python
import time

class Worker:
    def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
        self.id = worker_id
        self.reference = None
        self.last_active = last_active if last_active is not None else time.time()  # Assign current time if last_active is not provided
        self.started = time.time()
        self.tasks = set()
        self.info = {}

    def prune(self, config):
        if self.last_active + config.worker_disconnect_delay < time.time():
            # Prune the worker
            pass
```

With this corrected code, the `last_active` attribute will default to the current time if not provided, ensuring that there are no `NoneType` errors when comparing it with an integer in the `prune` method.

This corrected code should pass the failing test as described in the expected values and types of variables.
