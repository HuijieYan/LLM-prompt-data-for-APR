The issue in the buggy function `__init__` is that it doesn't handle the case when `last_active` is `None`. This results in a `TypeError` when trying to add `None` with an integer in the test case.

To fix this bug, we need to check if `last_active` is `None` before performing any arithmetic operations with it.

Here is the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
    self.id = worker_id
    self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
    self.last_active = last_active  # seconds since epoch
    self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
    self.tasks = set()  # task objects
    self.info = {}

    if self.last_active is None:
        self.last_active = 0
```

With this correction, the function will initialize `last_active` to `0` if it is `None`, avoiding the `TypeError` when adding it with an integer.

This fix ensures that the function can handle cases where `last_active` is not provided during initialization.

The corrected function should now pass the failing test case provided.
