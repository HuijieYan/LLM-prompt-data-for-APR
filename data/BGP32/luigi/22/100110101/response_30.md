## Correction:

To fix the bug in the `__init__` function of the `Worker` class, we need to ensure that `last_active` is properly initialized to a default value if it is not provided during the object instantiation.

Here is the corrected version of the `__init__` function:

```python
import time

class Worker:
    def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
        self.id = worker_id
        self.reference = None
        self.last_active = last_active if last_active is not None else time.time()
        self.started = time.time()
        self.tasks = set()
        self.info = {}
```

The key change made is to set `self.last_active` to the current time using `time.time()` if the `last_active` parameter is not provided.

This correction ensures that the `last_active` attribute always has a valid value, preventing the `TypeError` that was occurring when trying to add an integer to a `NoneType`.

When this corrected version is used, the `test_worker_prune_after_init` test should pass without any errors.
