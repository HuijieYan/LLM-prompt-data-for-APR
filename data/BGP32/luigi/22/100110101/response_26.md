The bug in the `__init__` function of the `Worker` class is caused by the default value for the `last_active` parameter being `None`, leading to a `TypeError` when attempting to perform addition with `None` and an integer.

To fix this bug, we can set a default value for `last_active` that is compatible with the subsequent addition operation inside the function.

Here is the corrected version of the `__init__` function:

```python
def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
    self.id = worker_id
    self.reference = None
    self.last_active = last_active if last_active is not None else time.time()  # Assign current time if last_active is None
    self.started = time.time()
    self.tasks = set()
    self.info = {}
```

By assigning the current time to `self.last_active` if the `last_active` parameter is `None`, we ensure that a valid value is always used for calculations within the `__init__` function.

This corrected version should pass the failing test case provided.
