The bug in the provided function is due to the `last_active` parameter being set to `None`. When the `prune` method is called in the test, it tries to add `config.worker_disconnect_delay`, which is an integer, to `self.last_active`, causing a `TypeError` due to the unsupported operand types.

To fix this bug, we need to ensure that `last_active` is initialized with the correct value. We can set it to the current time if no value is provided.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
import time

def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
    self.id = worker_id
    self.reference = None
    self.last_active = last_active if last_active is not None else time.time()
    self.started = time.time()
    self.tasks = set()
    self.info = {}
```

With this correction, the function will set `last_active` to the current time if no value is provided, ensuring that the addition operation in the `prune` method will not result in a `TypeError`.
