To fix the bug in the `__init__` method of the `Worker` class in `luigi/scheduler.py`, we need to handle the case where `last_active` is `None`. 

Here is the corrected version of the code:

```python
import time

class Worker:
    def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
        self.id = worker_id
        self.reference = None
        self.last_active = last_active if last_active is not None else time.time()
        self.started = time.time()
        self.tasks = set()
        self.info = {}

    def prune(self, config):
        if self.last_active + config.worker_disconnect_delay < time.time():
            # Perform pruning logic here
            pass
```

By explicitly checking if `last_active` is `None` in the `__init__` method and assigning the current time if it is, we can avoid the `TypeError` that was occurring in the failing test.

With this correction, the `Worker` class initialization will handle both cases of `last_active` being provided or not. This should make the failing test `test_worker_prune_after_init` pass as expected.
