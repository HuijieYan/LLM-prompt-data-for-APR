The bug in the `__init__` function is that the `last_active` parameter is not being assigned to the class attribute `self.last_active`.

### Cause of the bug:
- The `last_active` parameter is not being utilized within the `__init__` function, resulting in it not being assigned to the class attribute `self.last_active`.
- As a result, the `last_active` value is not updated and remains as the default `None`, causing the failing test.

### Fix strategy:
- Modify the `__init__` function to assign the `last_active` parameter to the `self.last_active` attribute.

### Corrected version of the `__init__` function:
```python
def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
    self.id = worker_id
    self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
    self.last_active = last_active  # assign last_active parameter to class attribute
    self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
    self.tasks = set()  # task objects
    self.info = {}
```

With this correction, the `last_active` parameter will be properly assigned to the `self.last_active` attribute, resolving the bug and ensuring that the test passes with the expected input/output values.
