The bug in the `__init__` method of the `Worker` class is the incorrect assignment of the `last_active` parameter. In the current implementation, it is being set by default to `None` instead of the provided `last_active` value. This leads to the discrepancy in the actual value of `self.last_active` compared to the expected value.

To fix this bug, we need to correctly assign the `last_active` parameter to `self.last_active`. Here is the corrected version of the `__init__` method:

```python
# The corrected version of the buggy function
def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
    self.id = worker_id
    self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
    self.last_active = last_active if last_active is not None else time.time()  # seconds since epoch
    self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
    self.tasks = set()  # task objects
    self.info = {}
```

With this correction, the `last_active` parameter provided at initialization will be correctly assigned to `self.last_active`, ensuring that the expected values match the actual values during the failing test execution.
