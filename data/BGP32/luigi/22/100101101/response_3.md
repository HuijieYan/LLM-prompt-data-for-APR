The bug in the `__init__` function is that the `last_active` parameter is not being correctly assigned to the instance variable `self.last_active`. Instead, the `last_active` parameter is being assigned to the `worker_id` parameter causing the incorrect value at the return stage. 

To fix this bug, we need to change the assignment of `last_active` to `self.last_active` within the `__init__` function.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
    self.id = worker_id
    self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
    self.last_active = last_active  # Assigning the parameter last_active correctly
    self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
    self.tasks = set()  # task objects
    self.info = {}
```

With this correction, the function should now correctly assign the `last_active` parameter to the `self.last_active` instance variable.

This corrected version should pass the failing test case provided.
