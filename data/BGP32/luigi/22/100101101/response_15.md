## Bug Explanation
In the buggy function `__init__`, the `last_active` parameter is assigned to `self.last_active`, but the provided test `test_worker_prune_after_init` expects `last_active` to be assigned to the correct variable. This leads to the failing test because the `prune` method called in the test relies on `last_active` being correctly set in the `Worker` instance.

## Bug Fix
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the `last_active` parameter is assigned to the correct variable `last_active` instead of `self.last_active`. This adjustment will satisfy the expectation of the failing test.

## The corrected version of the buggy function
```python
def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
    self.id = worker_id
    self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
    last_active = last_active  # seconds since epoch
    self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
    self.tasks = set()  # task objects
    self.info = {}
```
