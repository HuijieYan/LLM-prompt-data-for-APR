The bug in the `__init__` function is that the `last_active` parameter is not being properly assigned. The expected behavior is to assign the provided `last_active` value to the `self.last_active` attribute. 

To fix this bug, we need to update the assignment of the `last_active` parameter to the `self.last_active` attribute in the `__init__` function. 

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
import time

def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
    self.id = worker_id
    self.reference = None
    self.last_active = last_active if last_active is not None else time.time()
    self.started = time.time()
    self.tasks = set()
    self.info = {}
```

By checking if the `last_active` parameter is `None`, we can properly assign the current time using `time.time()` if no value is provided, otherwise, assign the provided `last_active` value to `self.last_active`.

This corrected version should now pass the failing test case as described.
