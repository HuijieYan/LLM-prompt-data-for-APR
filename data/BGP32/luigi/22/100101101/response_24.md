## Bug Explanation
The bug in the provided function is that the `last_active` parameter is not being correctly assigned when creating a new Worker object. The `last_active` parameter is being ignored during initialization, which results in `last_active` being `None` instead of the passed value.

## Fix Strategy
To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the `last_active` parameter is correctly assigned during the initialization of the Worker object.

## The corrected version of the buggy function
```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: luigi/scheduler.py

# corrected function
def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
    self.id = worker_id
    self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
    self.last_active = last_active if last_active is not None else time.time()  # checking for None value
    self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
    self.tasks = set()  # task objects
    self.info = {}
```

By making this correction, the `last_active` parameter will be correctly assigned if a value is provided, or it will default to the current time using `time.time()` if no value is passed. This change ensures that the expected values are met during the failing test execution.
