The bug in the `__init__` method of the `Worker` class is that the `last_active` parameter is not being assigned correctly. It is expected to be initialized as `last_active` if provided, otherwise as `None`, but in the buggy function, it is being set to the current time.

To fix this issue, we need to update the initialization of `self.last_active` to use the provided `last_active` parameter if it is not `None`, otherwise set it to `None`.

Here is the corrected version of the `__init__` method:

```python
def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
    self.id = worker_id
    self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
    self.last_active = last_active if last_active is not None else None  # seconds since epoch
    self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
    self.tasks = set()  # task objects
    self.info = {}
```

With this correction, the `last_active` parameter will be correctly initialized as provided in the failing test, and the function should now pass the test case.
