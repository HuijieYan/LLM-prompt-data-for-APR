The bug in the provided code is that the `last_active` parameter is not correctly assigned to `self.last_active` in the `__init__` function. This results in `last_active` being unchanged instead of being assigned to `self.last_active`. 

To fix this bug, we need to assign the `last_active` parameter to `self.last_active` in the `__init__` function.

Here is the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: luigi/scheduler.py

def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
    self.id = worker_id
    self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
    self.last_active = last_active  # seconds since epoch
    self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
    self.tasks = set()  # task objects
    self.info = {}
    
    if last_active is not None:
        self.last_active = last_active
```

By adding the check `if last_active is not None:` and assigning `last_active` to `self.last_active` inside the `__init__` function, we ensure that the `last_active` parameter is correctly assigned to `self.last_active`.

This correction should now make the `test_worker_prune_after_init` function pass as the `last_active` parameter will be properly assigned to the `self.last_active` variable.
