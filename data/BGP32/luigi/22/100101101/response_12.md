The bug in the provided function `__init__` is that it is not correctly assigning the value of `last_active`. In the buggy code, `last_active` is assigned to the input parameter `last_active` if provided, otherwise `None`. However, in the failing test, the `prune` method is called on the `Worker` object which expects `last_active` to have a specific value.

To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the `last_active` parameter is correctly assigned the value passed during initialization. 

Here is the corrected version of the `__init__` function:

```python
def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
    self.id = worker_id
    self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
    self.last_active = last_active if last_active is not None else time.time()  # seconds since epoch
    self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
    self.tasks = set()  # task objects
    self.info = {}
```

With this correction, the `last_active` parameter will be properly initialized with the provided value if present, otherwise it will default to the current time.

This modification will ensure that the `Worker` object behaves as expected in the failing test scenario, where `prune` method is called with the expected `last_active` value.
