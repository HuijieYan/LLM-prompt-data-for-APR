The bug in the `__init__` function of the `Worker` class is that it is not correctly assigning the `last_active` parameter passed to the `self.last_active` attribute. This causes the function to behave unexpectedly and fail the test.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the `last_active` parameter is correctly assigned to `self.last_active`.

Here is the corrected version of the `__init__` function:

```python
def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
    self.id = worker_id
    self.reference = None
    self.last_active = last_active if last_active is not None else time.time()
    self.started = time.time()
    self.tasks = set()
    self.info = {}
```

With this correction, the `last_active` parameter is now properly assigned to `self.last_active`. This fix ensures that the test case `test_worker_prune_after_init` will pass as expected.
