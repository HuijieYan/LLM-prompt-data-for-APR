The bug in the provided code is that the `last_active` parameter is not properly assigned in the `__init__` function. It should be assigned based on the `last_active` input parameter rather than being set to `None`. This causes the failing test case as the `prune` method is expecting the `last_active` to be properly initialized.

To fix this issue, the `last_active` parameter should be assigned to `self.last_active` in the `__init__` function.

Here is the corrected version of the buggy function:
```python
def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
    self.id = worker_id
    self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
    self.last_active = last_active if last_active is not None else time.time()  # seconds since epoch or current time
    self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
    self.tasks = set()  # task objects
    self.info = {}
```

With this correction, the `last_active` parameter is properly assigned in the `__init__` function depending on the input parameter provided, and the failing test case `test_worker_prune_after_init` should now pass as expected.
