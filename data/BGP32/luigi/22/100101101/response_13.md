The bug in the provided function `__init__` is that it is not correctly assigning the input parameter `last_active` to the instance variable `self.last_active`. Instead, it is assigning the current time to both `self.last_active` and `self.started`. 

To fix this bug, we need to ensure that `last_active` is used to initialize `self.last_active` and the current time is used to initialize `self.started`.

Here is the corrected version of the `__init__` function:

```python
def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
    self.id = worker_id
    self.reference = None
    self.last_active = last_active if last_active is not None else time.time()
    self.started = time.time()
    self.tasks = set()
    self.info = {}
```

With this correction, the `last_active` parameter will correctly initialize the `self.last_active` instance variable, and `time.time()` will initialize the `self.started` instance variable if `last_active` is not provided.

This will ensure that the test case `test_worker_prune_after_init` passes as expected.
