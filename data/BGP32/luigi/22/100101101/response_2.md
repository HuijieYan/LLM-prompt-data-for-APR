## Bug Explanation
The bug in the `__init__` function is that the `last_active` parameter is not being properly assigned when it is provided. Instead, the `last_active` parameter is being assigned to the `last_active` attribute of the object which causes the issue in the test case where the `prune` method expects the `last_active` attribute to be set to a specific value.

## Bug Fix
To fix the bug, we need to properly assign the `last_active` parameter to the `self.last_active` attribute of the object. 

Here is the corrected version of the `__init__` function:
```python
def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
    self.id = worker_id
    self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
    self.last_active = last_active if last_active is not None else time.time()  # seconds since epoch
    self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
    self.tasks = set()  # task objects
    self.info = {}
```

With this correction, the `last_active` parameter will be correctly assigned to the `self.last_active` attribute allowing the `prune` method to work properly.
