The bug in the provided code is related to the incorrect assignment of the `last_active` variable in the `__init__` method of the `Worker` class. The `last_active` variable should be initialized with the value passed as an argument to the constructor, but in the current implementation, it is set to `None` regardless of the input value.

To fix this issue, we should update the `__init__` method to properly assign the `last_active` argument to the `self.last_active` variable.

Here is the corrected version of the `__init__` method:
```python
class Worker:
    def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
        self.id = worker_id
        self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
        self.last_active = last_active if last_active is not None else time.time()  # seconds since epoch if last_active is not provided
        self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        self.tasks = set()  # task objects
        self.info = {}
```

This corrected version properly assigns the `last_active` argument passed to the constructor, and if it is not provided, it defaults to the current time.

By applying this fix, the `test_worker_prune_after_init` test should now pass, and the `last_active` variable will be properly initialized with the expected value.
