The bug in the `__init__` function of the `Worker` class is that the `last_active` parameter is not being properly assigned in the constructor. The `last_active` parameter should be set to the value passed as an argument, but it is currently not being assigned.

To fix this bug, we need to update the `__init__` function to properly assign the `last_active` parameter when provided. Here is the corrected version:

```python
def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
    self.id = worker_id
    self.reference = None
    self.last_active = last_active if last_active is not None else time.time()  # Assign last_active if provided, otherwise set it to current time
    self.started = time.time()
    self.tasks = set()  
    self.info = {}
```

With this correction, the `last_active` parameter will be properly assigned if provided, otherwise, it will default to the current time. This fix ensures that the expected values and types of variables during the failing test execution are met.
