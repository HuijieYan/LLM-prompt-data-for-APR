The bug in the `__init__` function is that the `last_active` parameter is not being assigned correctly. It should be set to the provided `last_active` value if it is not None.

The fix for this bug is to add a conditional statement to check if the `last_active` parameter is provided. If it is provided, then assign it to `self.last_active`, otherwise, leave it as None.

Here is the corrected version of the `__init__` function:

```python
def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
    self.id = worker_id
    self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
    self.last_active = last_active if last_active is not None else time.time()  # seconds since epoch
    self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
    self.tasks = set()  # task objects
    self.info = {}
```

With this correction, the `last_active` parameter is assigned correctly based on the input value provided during initialization. This will make the `test_worker_prune_after_init` test pass as expected.
