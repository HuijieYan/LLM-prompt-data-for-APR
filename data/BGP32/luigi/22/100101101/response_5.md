The bug in the `__init__` method lies in the incorrect initialization of the `last_active` attribute. The expected input value for `last_active` is provided as a parameter but it is not being assigned correctly in the buggy function.

To fix this bug, we need to update the `__init__` method to properly initialize the `last_active` attribute with the provided parameter value.

Here is the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
    self.id = worker_id
    self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
    self.last_active = last_active  # seconds since epoch
    self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
    self.tasks = set()  # task objects
    self.info = {}
```

With this correction, the `last_active` attribute will be properly initialized with the provided value and the failing test case `test_worker_prune_after_init` should pass successfully.
