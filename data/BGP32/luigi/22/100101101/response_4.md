The bug in the current implementation is that the `last_active` parameter is not correctly assigned to the `last_active` instance variable in the `__init__` function of the `Worker` class. The `last_active` parameter is provided but not utilized in the function.

To fix this bug, we need to assign the `last_active` parameter to the `last_active` instance variable in the `__init__` function.

Here is the corrected version of the `__init__` function:

```python
# The corrected version of the buggy function
def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
    self.id = worker_id
    self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
    self.last_active = last_active if last_active is not None else time.time()  # seconds since epoch
    self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
    self.tasks = set()  # task objects
    self.info = {}
```

By adding the condition `if last_active is not None else time.time()` when assigning the `last_active` parameter to the `self.last_active` variable, we ensure that if `last_active` is provided, it will be used directly, otherwise, the current time will be assigned.

With this correction, the `__init__` function will now correctly initialize the `last_active` variable based on the input parameter, resolving the bug.

This corrected version should pass the failing test scenario provided.
