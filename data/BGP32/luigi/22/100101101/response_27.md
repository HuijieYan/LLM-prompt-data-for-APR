The issue with the current implementation is that the `last_active` parameter is not being assigned correctly in the `__init__` function of the `Worker` class. It is always set to `None` instead of the provided `last_active` value.

To fix this issue, we need to update the `__init__` function to correctly assign the `last_active` parameter if it is provided.

Here is the corrected version of the `__init__` function:

```python
def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
    self.id = worker_id
    self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
    if last_active is not None:
        self.last_active = last_active  # seconds since epoch if provided
    else:
        self.last_active = time.time()  # seconds since epoch if last_active is not provided
    self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
    self.tasks = set()  # task objects
    self.info = {}
```

This corrected version checks if the `last_active` parameter is provided and assigns it if it is not `None`. Otherwise, it assigns the current time using `time.time()`.

With this fix, the `Worker` object will now correctly initialize the `last_active` attribute based on the input provided.

The failing test `test_worker_prune_after_init` should now pass with this corrected implementation.
