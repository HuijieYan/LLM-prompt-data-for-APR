The bug in the `__init__` function is that it is not correctly setting the `last_active` parameter. It should assign the value passed as the `last_active` parameter if provided, otherwise, default to `None`. Currently, it always assigns `None` to `self.last_active`.

To fix the bug, we need to update the `__init__` function to handle the `last_active` parameter correctly.

Here is the corrected version of the `__init__` function:

```python
def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
    self.id = worker_id
    self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
    self.last_active = last_active if last_active is not None else None  # seconds since epoch
    self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
    self.tasks = set()  # task objects
    self.info = {}
```

Now, the `last_active` parameter will be correctly assigned based on the input provided. This correction should fix the failing test case `test_worker_prune_after_init`.
