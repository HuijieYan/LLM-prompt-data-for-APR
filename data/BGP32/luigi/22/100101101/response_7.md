## Bug Explanation
The bug in the provided `__init__` function is that the `last_active` parameter is not properly assigned to the instance variable `self.last_active`. The `last_active` parameter is passed in as an argument but is not being correctly stored in the `self.last_active` instance variable. This causes the mismatch between the expected and actual values in the failing test scenario.

## Fix Strategy
To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the `last_active` parameter is properly assigned to the `self.last_active` instance variable within the `__init__` function.

## The corrected version of the function
```python
def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
    self.id = worker_id
    self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
    self.last_active = last_active if last_active is not None else time.time()  # seconds since epoch
    self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
    self.tasks = set()  # task objects
    self.info = {}
```

This corrected version of the `__init__` function properly assigns the `last_active` parameter to the `self.last_active` instance variable while also retaining the default behavior of setting the current time if `last_active` is not provided. This change ensures that the expected values match the actual values during the failing test scenario.
