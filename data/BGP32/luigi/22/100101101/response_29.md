The bug in the `__init__` function of the `Worker` class lies in the initialization of the `last_active` attribute. At the moment, it is being set to the value of `last_active` if provided, otherwise it remains `None`. However, in the failing test, the `prune` method is being called with an object of type `TmpCfg`, which implies that a `last_active` value should be set during initialization.

To fix the bug, we need to update the `__init__` function to correctly set the `last_active` attribute to the value provided in the `last_active` parameter. If the `last_active` parameter is not provided, we can set it to a default value.

Here is the corrected version of the `__init__` function:

```python
# The corrected version of the buggy function
def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
    self.id = worker_id
    self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
    self.last_active = last_active if last_active is not None else time.time()  # seconds since epoch
    self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
    self.tasks = set()  # task objects
    self.info = {}
```

With this correction, the `last_active` attribute will be correctly initialized based on the `last_active` parameter passed during the instantiation of the `Worker` class. Now, the failing test should pass as the expected values and types of variables will match the actual values and types.
