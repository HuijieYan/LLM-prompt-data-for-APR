The bug in the `__init__` function arises from not correctly assigning the `last_active` parameter to the class attribute `last_active`. The `last_active` parameter is not being used to populate the `last_active` attribute, resulting in it being `None` by default.

To fix this bug, we need to assign the `last_active` parameter to the `last_active` attribute within the `__init__` function.

Here is the corrected version of the `__init__` function:

```python
def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
    self.id = worker_id
    self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
    self.last_active = last_active if last_active is not None else time.time()  # assign last_active if provided, else current time
    self.started = time.time()  # current time
    self.tasks = set()  # task objects
    self.info = {}
```

This corrected version ensures that if the `last_active` parameter is provided, it will be assigned to the `last_active` attribute. Otherwise, the current time will be used as the default value for `last_active`.

With this fix, the test case `test_worker_prune_after_init` should pass as the `last_active` attribute will be correctly initialized.
