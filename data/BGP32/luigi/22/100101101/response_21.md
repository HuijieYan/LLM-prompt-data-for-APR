The bug in the provided code is that the `last_active` parameter is not being correctly assigned in the `__init__` function of the `Worker` class. It is set to the default value of `None` instead of the provided value in the constructor.

To fix this bug, we need to correctly assign the `last_active` parameter in the `__init__` function.

Here is the corrected version of the `__init__` function:

```python
# The corrected version of the __init__ function
def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
    self.id = worker_id
    self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
    self.last_active = last_active if last_active is not None else time.time()  # seconds since epoch
    self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
    self.tasks = set()  # task objects
    self.info = {}
```

By modifying the assignment of `self.last_active` to properly handle the default value when `last_active` is not provided, we ensure that the `last_active` parameter is correctly initialized in the `Worker` object.

With this correction, the failing test should now pass as the `last_active` parameter is correctly handled in the `__init__` function.
