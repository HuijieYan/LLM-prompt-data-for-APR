The bug in the `__init__` function lies in the incorrect assignment of the `last_active` parameter. Currently, it is directly assigned to the `self.last_active` attribute, which should be changed to assign it to the `last_active` parameter if it is not None.

The strategy to fix the bug is to update the assignment of `last_active` in the `__init__` function to conditionally assign it to the `self.last_active` attribute only if it is not None.

Here is the corrected version of the `__init__` function:

```python
# The corrected version of the buggy function
def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
    self.id = worker_id
    self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
    self.last_active = last_active if last_active is not None else time.time()  # seconds since epoch if last_active is None
    self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
    self.tasks = set()  # task objects
    self.info = {}
```

With this correction, the `last_active` parameter will be assigned to `self.last_active` only if it is not None, otherwise, the current epoch time will be assigned by default. This change ensures that the `last_active` value is correctly initialized in the `Worker` object.

The corrected version of the `__init__` function should now pass the failing test case provided.
