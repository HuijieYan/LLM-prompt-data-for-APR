The bug in the provided code is that the `last_active` attribute is not being properly initialized if the `last_active` parameter is passed to the `__init__` function. This results in the `last_active` attribute having a value of `None` instead of the passed `last_active` value.

To fix this issue, we need to correctly initialize the `last_active` attribute based on the input parameter `last_active` if it's provided.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
    self.id = worker_id
    self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
    self.last_active = last_active if last_active is not None else time.time()  # seconds since epoch
    self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
    self.tasks = set()  # task objects
    self.info = {}
```

With this correction, the `last_active` attribute will be properly initialized with the value passed to the `__init__` function or the current time if no value is provided. This should fix the failing test `test_worker_prune_after_init`.
