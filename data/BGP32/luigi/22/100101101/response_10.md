The bug in the provided `__init__` function is that the `last_active` parameter is not correctly assigned to the instance variable `self.last_active`. The `last_active` parameter is passed to the function but not used, which leads to incorrect behavior when trying to access `self.last_active`.

To fix this issue, we need to assign the `last_active` parameter value to the instance variable `self.last_active` in the `__init__` function. 

Here is the corrected version of the `__init__` function:

```python
# The corrected version of the buggy function
def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
    self.id = worker_id
    self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
    self.last_active = last_active if last_active is not None else time.time()  # assign last_active or current time
    self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
    self.tasks = set()  # task objects
    self.info = {}
```

With this correction, the `last_active` parameter will correctly initialize `self.last_active` with the passed value or the current time if no value is provided.

This correction ensures that the `last_active` parameter is correctly incorporated into the initialization of the Worker instance, resolving the issue identified in the failing test case.
