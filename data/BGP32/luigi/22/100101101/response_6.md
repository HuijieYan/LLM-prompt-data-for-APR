### Bug Explanation
The bug in the `__init__` function arises from the incorrect assignment of the `last_active` variable. The `last_active` parameter is not being properly assigned to the class member `last_active`, which results in the incorrect initialization of this variable.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to correctly assign the `last_active` parameter to the class member `last_active` in the `__init__` function.

### Corrected Version of the Buggy Function
```python
def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
    self.id = worker_id
    self.reference = None
    self.last_active = last_active if last_active is not None else time.time()
    self.started = time.time()
    self.tasks = set()
    self.info = {}
```

After fixing the code in the `__init__` function as shown above, the `last_active` parameter will be correctly initialized to the provided value if it is not `None`, otherwise it will default to the current time. This correction ensures that the test function `test_worker_prune_after_init` will pass as expected.
