## Fixing the Bug

### Bug Analysis
The bug in the provided code is that the `last_active` parameter in the `__init__` function is not correctly assigned to the `self.last_active` variable. This results in the `last_active` variable being `None` instead of the intended value.

### Bug Cause
The bug is caused by not assigning the `last_active` parameter to the `self.last_active` variable correctly in the `__init__` function.

### Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to correctly assign the `last_active` parameter to the `self.last_active` variable in the `__init__` function.

### Corrected Version
```python
# The corrected version of the buggy function
def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
    self.id = worker_id
    self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
    self.last_active = last_active if last_active is not None else time.time()  # seconds since epoch
    self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
    self.tasks = set()  # task objects
    self.info = {}

```

By making this change, the `last_active` parameter will be correctly assigned to the `self.last_active` variable in the `__init__` function, ensuring that the expected values are correctly set during the test execution.
