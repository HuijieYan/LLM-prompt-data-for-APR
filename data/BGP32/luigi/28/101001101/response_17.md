The bug in the provided function is that the condition `return stdout and table in stdout` is not correctly checking if the table exists in the output of the `run_hive_cmd` function. The `stdout` string has the format 'OK\nmytable', and the current condition is checking for an exact match which will fail.

To fix this bug, we should split the `stdout` string into lines and check if the table exists in any of the lines. Additionally, we need to consider the case when `stdout` is empty or None, indicating that the table does not exist.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
# The corrected version of the buggy function
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and any(table in line for line in stdout.split('\n'))
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                                (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        return bool(stdout)
```

This corrected version splits the `stdout` string by lines and checks if the `table` is in any of the lines. It also properly handles the case when `stdout` is empty.
