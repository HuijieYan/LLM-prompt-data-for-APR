The bug in the `table_exists` function lies in the condition check after running the hive command. The function checks if `stdout` is truthy to determine if the table exists. However, in some cases, the output of the hive command might contain multiple table names separated by newline characters. In these cases, the current logic fails because it checks if the entire output string contains the table name.

To fix this issue, we need to split the output by newline characters and then check if the table name exists in any of the lines.

Here is the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    def partition_spec(self, partition):
        # Please ignore the body of this function

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

            return stdout and table in stdout.split('\n')
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

            return bool(stdout)
```

With this correction, the function splits the `stdout` by newline characters and checks if the table name exists in any of the lines. This modification ensures that the function correctly determines the existence of the table based on the output of the hive command.
