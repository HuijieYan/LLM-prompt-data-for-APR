### Bug Analysis:
The bug in the `table_exists` function lies in the condition check when `stdout` is being evaluated. In both cases where `partition` is None and when it is not None, the function directly checks if `stdout` has a truthy value. However, the `run_hive_cmd` function doesn't provide a reliable output representation to directly check for table existence in this way. Additionally, the query result in the `stdout` variable includes the database name as part of the table name, which can cause false negatives or incorrect results when checking for table existence.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix this bug, we need to modify how the table existence is checked. It would be more reliable to retrieve the exact list of table names from the query result and then check if the specified table is in that list. We also need to ensure that we are correctly accounting for the database prefix in the table names.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables;'.format(database))
        
        table_list = stdout.split('\n')
        
        for t in table_list:
            if t.endswith(table):
                return True
        
        return False
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                         (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

By retrieving the complete list of table names and then directly checking if the specified table is in that list, we can accurately determine the existence of the table. Additionally, always showing tables instead of using the `like` statement ensures no false negatives due to incomplete matching.
