### Bug in the Buggy Function

The bug in the `table_exists` function arises from the comparison between the given `table` and the `stdout` output after running the respective hive commands. The buggy function checks if the `table` is present in the `stdout` output to determine the existence of the table, but it fails due to the incorrect logic causing the function to return incorrect results.

In the first part of the function, if there is no `partition`, the function runs a hive command to show tables like the given `table` name in the specified `database`. However, it incorrectly checks if the `table` is in the `stdout`, which may lead to false positives or negatives due to the structure of the `stdout`.

In the second part of the function, if there is a `partition`, it tries to show partitions of the `table` specified by the `partition` in the given `database`. The use of `show partitions` command is correct, but the comparison of the `stdout` with `True` or `False` does not serve the purpose of checking the existence of the table correctly.

### Fix Strategy

To fix the bug, we need to adjust the way the function checks for the existence of the table in both cases (with and without partitions). Instead of comparing the `stdout` directly to `True` or `False`, we should revise the condition to accurately detect the presence of the specified `table`.

### Corrected Function

Here is the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
    
        return stdout.strip() == table
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables in {1} like "{2}" partition ({3});'.format(database, table, partition, self.partition_spec(partition)))
    
        return stdout.strip() == table
```

In the corrected version, we use the `strip()` function to remove leading/trailing whitespaces from the `stdout` output before comparing it with the specified `table`. This ensures that the comparison is accurate and correctly determines the existence of the table. Moreover, the query for tables with partitions is modified to include the `partition` for better accuracy in checking the existence of the specified table.
