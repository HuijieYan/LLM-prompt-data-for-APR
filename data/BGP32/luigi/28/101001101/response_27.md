The bug in the provided function `table_exists` is related to how it checks if a table exists in a given database. The issue lies in the comparison logic of the returned `stdout` from the `run_hive_cmd` function. The function incorrectly checks if the `table` string is present in the `stdout`, which can lead to false positives if the table name is a substring of another table name in the output.

To fix the bug, we can modify the function to search for an exact match of the table name in the `stdout` result by splitting the `stdout` on newlines and then splitting each line on tabs or spaces to extract the table names for comparison. This way, we ensure that the table names match exactly with the queried table.

Here is the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
# The relative path of the file: luigi/contrib/hive.py

# Import needed libraries
import re

# Function run_hive_cmd and class HiveCommandClient remain as they are


# Fixing the buggy function
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table in stdout.split()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        return bool(stdout)  # Just return the boolean result directly

```

With this correction, we split the `stdout` on spaces and tabs, effectively extracting the table names from the output. Then we perform an exact match to check if the queried table exists in the list of tables. This approach ensures a more precise check for the existence of the table in the database.
