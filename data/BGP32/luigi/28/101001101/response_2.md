The bug in the provided function arises from the comparison logic used to determine if a table exists in the database. The bug occurs when checking the existence of a table with a different case sensitivity compared to the actual table name in the database. This discrepancy leads to incorrect outputs in specific cases where the table name provided to the function has a different case from the tables present in the database.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the comparison between the provided table name and the tables in the database is case-insensitive. One way to address this issue is by converting both the table name from the function input and the tables retrieved from the database into the same case (e.g., lowercase or uppercase) before comparing them.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: luigi/contrib/hive.py

# This function from the same file, but not the same class, is called by the buggy function
def run_hive_cmd(hivecmd, check_return_code=True):
    # Please ignore the body of this function

# The declaration of the class containing the buggy function
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    # This function from the same class is called by the buggy function
    def partition_spec(self, partition):
        # Please ignore the body of this function

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
    
            return stdout and table.lower() in map(str.lower, stdout.split())
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                                (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
    
            if stdout:
                return True
            else:
                return False
```

In the corrected version, we convert both the input table name and the tables retrieved from the database to lowercase for a case-insensitive comparison. This modification ensures that the function accurately checks for the existence of the specified table in the database, regardless of the case used in the function input.

Please replace the buggy function with this corrected version to address the bug and ensure consistent behavior across different table names' capitalizations.
