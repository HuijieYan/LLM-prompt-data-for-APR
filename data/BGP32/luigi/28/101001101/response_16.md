The bug in the provided function is due to how the output of the `run_hive_cmd` function is being checked. The function is returning `True` or `False` based on whether the `stdout` variable is truthy or falsy, but the presence of the table name in the `stdout` string is what should be checked.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the condition to check if the table name is present in the `stdout` string. Additionally, the output of the `run_hive_cmd` function needs to be handled properly.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
# The relative path of the fixed file: luigi/contrib/hive.py

def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return table in stdout.split()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show partitions {1} partition ({2})'.format(database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        return bool(stdout)
``` 

This correction will properly check if the table name is present in the `stdout` string and return `True` or `False` accordingly.
