The bug in the `table_exists` function lies in the condition where it checks if the table name is in the output of the `run_hive_cmd` function. The problem arises because the `run_hive_cmd` function might return multiple tables in the output, causing table names with similar substrings to be incorrectly matched.

To fix this issue, we need to modify the condition to check for an exact match of the table name in the output. One way to achieve this is by splitting the stdout by newline characters and then checking for an exact match of the table name.

Here is the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
    
            return stdout and table in stdout.split('\n')
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                                (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
    
            if stdout:
                return True
            else:
                return False
```

This correction ensures that the function checks for an exact match of the table name in the list of tables returned by the `run_hive_cmd` function, preventing incorrect matches based on substrings.
