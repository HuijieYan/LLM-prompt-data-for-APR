### Bug in the Buggy Function

The bug in the `table_exists` function lies in the conditional check for the existence of the table. In the case where a partition is provided, the function generates a command to check for partition details rather than just table existence, leading to incorrect results.

### Strategy to Fix the Bug

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that when a partition is provided, the function only checks for table existence without involving partition checks.

### Corrected Version of the Buggy Function

```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    def partition_spec(self, partition):
        # Please ignore the body of this function

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
            return stdout and table in stdout
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
            return stdout and table in stdout
``` 

### Justification of the Correction

The corrected version of the `table_exists` function now will correctly check for the existence of the table without considering partitions when a partition is provided. This change aligns the behavior with the expected functionality of the function.
