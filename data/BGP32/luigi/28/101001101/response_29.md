### Bug Explanation
The bug in the `table_exists` function lies in the conditional check for the existence of the table. In the if condition, the function checks if the `stdout` variable is truthy and if `table` is in `stdout`. However, in some cases where `stdout` contains multiple lines like in Cases 2 and 4, the check might fail because `table` is not an exact match with one of the lines in `stdout`.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to modify the conditional check to ensure that `table` is matched with each line of the `stdout` variable instead of a direct containment check. We can split the `stdout` by lines and check if any line contains the `table` value.

### Corrected Version
```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and any(table in line for line in stdout.split('\n'))
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        return bool(stdout)
``` 

This corrected version properly checks if the `table` exists in the `stdout` variable line by line.
