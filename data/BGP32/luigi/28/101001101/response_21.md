The bug in the provided function `table_exists` lies in the conditionals used to check if a table exists in the database. When the `run_hive_cmd` function is called, the logic to determine table existence is incorrect due to how the output `stdout` is being processed.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the conditional checks to properly handle the output of the `run_hive_cmd` function and check if the table name is present in the output.

Here is the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
# The corrected version of the function
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table in stdout
    else:
        partition_spec_string = ', '.join(['%s = "%s"' % (k, v) for k, v in partition.items()])
        query = "use {};\nshow partitions {} partition ({});".format(database, table, partition_spec_string)
        stdout = run_hive_cmd(query)

        return stdout and len(stdout.splitlines()) > 2  # assumes the presence of partition directory
```

This corrected version addresses the issue with checking table existence in both scenarios when a partition is provided and when no partition is provided. The check for table existence in the case of a partition is modified to account for the presence of the partition directory listing in the output.

Ensure to replace the existing `table_exists` function in the `HiveCommandClient` class with this corrected version for the bug to be fixed.
