The bug in the provided function `table_exists` is due to the comparison `table in stdout` where it's checking if the entire table name is present as a substring in stdout, which can lead to incorrect results. 

To fix this bug, we need to split the stdout by newline characters and then check if the exact table name is present in the list of tables obtained. 

Here is the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables in {1};'.format(database, table))
        table_list = stdout.split('\n')
        return table in table_list
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

This revised version splits the `stdout` obtained from Hive by newline characters and then checks if the `table` is directly present in the list of tables. This modification ensures that we check for the exact table name rather than a partial match.
