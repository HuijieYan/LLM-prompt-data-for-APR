The bug in the provided function is due to the condition to check if the table exists. The function checks if the table name is present in the stdout output, but the comparison is case-sensitive. This results in mismatches between the expected and actual values, causing the function to fail.

To fix the bug, we can modify the line where the comparison is made to be case-insensitive. Additionally, we can strip any extra spaces or newlines from the stdout to ensure an accurate comparison.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
    
        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower().strip()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
    
        return bool(stdout)

```

This version fixes the case sensitivity issue in comparing the table name with the stdout and ensures that any extra whitespace is removed for accurate comparison. Now the function should pass all the provided test cases correctly.
