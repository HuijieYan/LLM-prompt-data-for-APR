### Bug Explanation
The bug in the `table_exists` function is due to the condition used to evaluate the existence of a table or partitions in Hive. 

In the first part of the function, when `partition` is `None`, it tries to find the table using a Hive command, then checks if the table name is in the output of the command. This logic is correct.

However, in the second part, when `partition` is not `None`, the function tries to find the partitions of the table using a different Hive command, but it doesn't correctly validate if the specified partition exists. The condition `if stdout:` only checks if the stdout is not empty, which is not a reliable way to determine if the partition exists.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug
To fix the bug, we need to check if the specified partition actually exists in the output of the Hive command when `partition` is not `None`. We can achieve this by parsing the output of the command and comparing it against the specified partition.

### Corrected Version of the Function
Here is the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
        return stdout and table in stdout
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd(f"use {database}; show partitions {table};")
        partitions = [part.split('=')[1] for part in stdout.split('\n') if part]
        specified_partition = '='.join([f"{k}={v}" for k, v in partition.items()])
        return specified_partition in partitions
```

This corrected version will correctly check if the specified partition exists. It first retrieves all the partitions for the table, then compares against the specified partition based on the key-value pairs provided.
