The bug in the provided function `table_exists` is likely due to incorrect logic in checking for the existence of a table in a Hive database.

The bug seems to be in the following line:
```python
return stdout and table in stdout
```
The issue is that the condition `stdout and table in stdout` will evaluate to `True` as long as `stdout` is not empty, without actually checking if the table exists in the output. This is why the function incorrectly returns `True` even when the table does not exist in the database.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the return statement to explicitly check if the table name exists in the `stdout` output. Also, we should handle the case where the table name in the `stdout` may have different casing than the input table name.

Below is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and any(t.lower() == table.lower() for t in stdout.split('\n') if t)
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

This corrected version checks if the table name (ignoring case) exists in the `stdout` output for the given database, ensuring the correct behavior of the function.
