The bug in the given function `table_exists` arises from the way it checks for the existence of a table. If the `partition` parameter is provided, the function constructs a command that uses `show partitions`, but in the return statement, it only checks if the `stdout` variable has a value or not. This does not accurately determine if the table exists.

To fix this bug, we should modify the return statement when a partition is provided to check if the table name is present in the `stdout` instead of just checking for the existence of `stdout`.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table in stdout
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        return table in stdout
```

With this modification, the function correctly returns `True` if the table exists and `False` if it doesn't, for both cases where a partition is provided and where it is not provided. The function now aligns with the expected input/output values provided.
