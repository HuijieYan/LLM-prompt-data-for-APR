### Analysis:
1. The buggy function is `table_exists` within the `HiveCommandClient` class.
2. The function checks if a table exists in a given database with an optional partition.
3. The bug seems to be that the function is returning `True` even when the table does not exist in some cases.
4. The issue arises when returning `True` or `False` based on the presence of the table/partition in the stdout output, which is not being handled correctly.
5. To fix this bug, we should properly check if the table/partition exists in the stdout output using conditions.

### Bug Fix:
```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table in stdout
    else:
        partition_output = self.partition_spec(partition)
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use {0}; show partitions {1} partition ({2})""".format(database, table, partition_output))

        return table in stdout
```

### Explanation:
- The bug was mainly in the condition checking in the `table_exists` function. The function did not check the presence of the actual table/partition in the `stdout` properly.
- In the corrected version, the stdout is checked against the table name only when checking for the table existence. For the partition, the specification is created using `self.partition_spec` and then checked against the full `stdout`.
- This fix ensures that the correct result is returned based on the actual existence of the table or partition in the output.
