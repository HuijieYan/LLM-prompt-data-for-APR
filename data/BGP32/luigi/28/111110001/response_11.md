### Analysis:
- The buggy function `table_exists` in the `HiveCommandClient` class makes use of the `run_hive_cmd` function to execute Hive commands.
- The function checks if a table exists in a specified database. If a partition is provided, it checks for the existence of that specific partition in the table.
- The bug arises due to incorrect comparison logic and handling of the output from the `run_hive_cmd` function.

### Bug:
The bug in the `table_exists` function arises from incorrect handling of the stdout returned by the `run_hive_cmd` function. The function is using `return stdout and table in stdout` to check if the table exists, which is incorrect because when the `stdout` is not empty, the truthiness of `stdout` itself does not guarantee the presence of the table name in it.

### Strategy for fixing the bug:
- Update the comparison logic to check if the table name is in the lines of the stdout.
- Handle the partition check properly by verifying if the partition spec exists in the stdout, if provided.

### Corrected Version:

```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
            return any(table == line.strip() for line in stdout.split('\n'))
        else:
            partition_str = self.partition_spec(partition)
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("use {0}; show partitions {1} {2}".format(database, table, partition_str))
            return any(partition_str == line.strip() for line in stdout.split('\n'))
```

By updating the logic to iterate over the lines of `stdout` and checking each line against the provided table name or partition spec, we can ensure the correct behavior of the function.
