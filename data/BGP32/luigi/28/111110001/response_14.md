### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `table_exists` in the `HiveCommandClient` class is calling the `run_hive_cmd` function to execute Hive commands.
2. The issue seems to be related to the comparison of the output with the provided table name.
3. The failing test is checking if the function correctly identifies the existence of a table in Hive based on the output of the command run.
4. The bug is most likely due to incorrect comparison logic or possibly incorrect output formatting when running the Hive command.
5. The `table_exists` function should return `True` if the table exists based on the Hive output, and `False` otherwise.

### Bug Fix:
To fix the bug, we need to adjust the logic of the `table_exists` function to correctly compare the output of the Hive command with the table name provided.

### Corrected Version:
```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
    
            return stdout and table in stdout
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
    
            return stdout is not None
```

By making this adjustment in the comparison logic within the `table_exists` function, the corrected version should pass the failing test provided.
