### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `table_exists` in the class `HiveCommandClient` is using the `run_hive_cmd` function to execute Hive commands.
2. The bug is likely in the logic where the function checks if a table exists in Hive based on the output of the `run_hive_cmd` function.
3. The failing test is asserting that the table exists, but the function implementation is not returning the correct result based on the command output.
4. The bug is likely due to the incorrect check of the table existence from the `run_hive_cmd` output.
5. The function should check if the table name is present in the output to accurately determine if the table exists.

### Correction:
To fix the bug, we need to modify the logic of the `table_exists` function to properly check if the table exists in Hive based on the output of the `run_hive_cmd` function.

```python
# The corrected version of the buggy function

class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
            return stdout and table in stdout
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd(
              """use {database}; show partitions {table} partition ({partition})""".format(database=database, table=table, partition=self.partition_spec(partition)))
    
            return table in stdout
```

With this correction, the `table_exists` function now correctly checks if the table exists in Hive based on the output of the `run_hive_cmd` function.

This corrected version should pass the failing test cases provided.
