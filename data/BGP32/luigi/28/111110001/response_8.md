### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `table_exists` in the `HiveCommandClient` class is used to check if a table exists in a specified Hive database.
2. The function calls `run_hive_cmd` to execute Hive commands.
3. The bug occurs when partition is not None, as the string formatting in the Hive command is not correct.
4. The failing test checks for case insensitivity when checking if a table exists.
5. The error is raised when the function does not return the correct result as expected by the test.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is caused by incorrect string formatting in the Hive command when partition is not None. This results in the Hive command not being constructed properly, leading to incorrect output when checking if a table exists.

### Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the Hive command is formatted correctly with the partition details when partition is not None. By correcting the formatting, the function should return the expected output for the test.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table in stdout
    else:
        # Correcting the Hive command formatting
        partition_string = ", ".join(["{0}='{1}'".format(k, v) for k, v in partition.items()])
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("use {0}; show partitions {1} partition ({2})".format(database, table, partition_string))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

By correcting the string formatting in the Hive command when partition is not None, the function should now return the correct output and pass the failing test.
