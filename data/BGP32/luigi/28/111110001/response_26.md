1. The buggy function is `table_exists()` located inside the `HiveCommandClient` class in the `luigi/contrib/hive.py` file. It calls the `run_hive_cmd()` function with a specific query string to check if a table exists in a given database with or without a specified partition.

2. The bug seems to be in the logic where the return value of `run_hive_cmd()` is not properly checked in all cases within the `table_exists()` function.

3. The buggy function `table_exists()` is supposed to call `run_hive_cmd()` and check its return value to determine if a table exists. The failing test is asserting that a table should be found based on the return value from `run_hive_cmd()`, but the logic of the function is not handling the return correctly. The function is returning `True` only if the return value is not empty, which is incorrect as it should also check if the table is present in the return value. This is causing the test to fail with an "AssertionError" because of a mismatch in the expected return value and the actual value returned by the function.

4. To fix the bug, we need to modify the logic in the `table_exists()` function to properly handle the return value from `run_hive_cmd()` by checking if the table name is present in the output string. Specifically, we can split the output by newline characters and check each line for the table name.

5. Here is the corrected version of the `table_exists()` function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
    
        return stdout and table in stdout
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
    
        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

By checking if the table name is in each line of the output, we ensure that the function is correctly identifying if the table exists and should now pass the failing test cases.
