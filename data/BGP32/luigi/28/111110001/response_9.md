## Analysis:
1. The buggy function `table_exists` in the `HiveCommandClient` class is supposed to check if a table exists in a database or a specific partition. It uses the `run_hive_cmd` function to execute Hive commands.
2. The potential error locations in the function include the condition where the table name is checked in the output of the Hive command, as well as the condition where the partition is checked.
3. The bug is causing the test cases to fail because the function is not correctly checking if the table exists based on the output of the Hive command.
4. The strategy to fix the bug would be to properly handle the output of the Hive command, ensuring that it is parsed correctly to check for the existence of the table or partition.
5. Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
    
        return "OK" in stdout.splitlines()
    else:
        partition_str = ','.join([f"{k}='{v}'" for k, v in partition.items()])
        stdout = run_hive_cmd(f"use {database}; show partitions {table} partition ({partition_str});")
    
        return "OK" in stdout.splitlines()
```

In this corrected version:
- For checking table existence in the database, we split the stdout by lines and check if `"OK"` is present in any of the lines.
- For checking the existence of a partition in the table, we first construct the partition specification and then split the stdout by lines to check the presence of `"OK"`.

This corrected version should pass the failing test cases.
