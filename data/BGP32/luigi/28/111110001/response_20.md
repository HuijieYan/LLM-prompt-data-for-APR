## Analysis:
1. The buggy function `table_exists` is from the `HiveCommandClient` class in the `luigi.contrib.hive.py` file.
2. It calls the `run_hive_cmd` function from the same file to execute Hive commands.
3. The failing test `test_table_exists` in `hive_test.py` mocks the `run_hive_cmd` function and tests the behavior of `table_exists`.
4. The error message shows that the test is failing because `self.assertTrue(returned)` is expecting `True` but getting `False`.

## Bug:
The bug is in the `table_exists` function's logic. When checking for table existence, the function makes use of the output of `run_hive_cmd` to determine if the table is present. However, it doesn't handle the output properly when the table is not found, leading to incorrect results.

## Fix:
- Modify the `table_exists` function to properly handle the output of `run_hive_cmd` when checking for table existence.
- Update the condition based on the output to return the correct boolean value when the table exists or does not exist.

## Corrected Version:
```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
            return stdout and table in stdout
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                                (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

            return bool(stdout)  # Change made here to return bool value based on stdout
```

By making the suggested change, the `table_exists` function should now return the correct boolean values when checking for table existence. This correction should resolve the failing tests.
