### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `table_exists` in the `HiveCommandClient` class is checking if a table exists by running a Hive query using `run_hive_cmd` function.
2. The function has an issue in handling the output of the `run_hive_cmd` function when checking for table existence and when partitions are involved.
3. When the table exists, the function is expected to return `True` but it is not doing so leading to assertion errors in the test cases.
4. The issue is likely due to how the `stdout` from `run_hive_cmd` is being handled in the function.
5. A potential fix would be to ensure that the function correctly checks the output for table existence and properly returning `True` or `False`.

### Bug Fix:
```python
# The corrected version of the buggy function
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
        return stdout and table in stdout
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use {0}; show partitions {1} partition ({2})""".format(database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
        return len(stdout) > 0
```

With this fixed version, the `table_exists` function properly checks for the presence of a table based on the output of the Hive query. It now handles the stdout from `run_hive_cmd` correctly for both cases of simple table existence check and when partitions are involved.
