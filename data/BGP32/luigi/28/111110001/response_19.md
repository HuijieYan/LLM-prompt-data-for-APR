### Analysis:
- The buggy function is `table_exists` within the `HiveCommandClient` class in the `hive.py` file.
- The function checks if a table exists in a database using a Hive query.
- Potential error locations are:
    - The condition `return stdout and table in stdout` can behave unexpectedly if `stdout` is not in the expected format.
    - The condition `if stdout` may not handle the response properly.
- The failing test reveals that the function is not accurately determining table existence, resulting in failed assertions.

### Cause of the Bug:
1. The buggy function does not handle the case where the output of the Hive command does not match the expected format.
2. The function does not properly check the existence of a table when there is a partition specified.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
1. Update the function to handle edge cases where the output of Hive commands may vary.
2. Ensure that table existence is checked correctly, especially when there are partitions involved.

### Corrected Version:
```python
from luigi.contrib.hive import run_hive_cmd

class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables;'.format(database))
            if stdout:
                return table in stdout.split('\n')
            return False
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd(
                'use {0}; show partitions {1} partition ({2});'.format(database, table, self.partition_spec(partition))
            )
            if stdout:
                return len(stdout.strip().split('\n')) > 0
            return False
```

### Changes Made:
1. Updated `run_hive_cmd` call to fetch all tables when partition is not specified in the first if condition.
2. Split `stdout` by '\n' to accurately check for table existence.
3. Handled the case to return True if there are partitions returned for the specific table.

By making these changes, the corrected version of the `table_exists` function should now correctly determine table existence and pass the failing test cases.
