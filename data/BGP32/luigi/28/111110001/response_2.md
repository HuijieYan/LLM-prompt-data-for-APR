1. The buggy function `table_exists` in the `HiveCommandClient` class is checking if a table exists in the Hive database by running a Hive command. However, the function logic is incorrect, which causes it to fail the test cases.

2. The potential error locations in the buggy function are:
   - The condition `return stdout and table in stdout` may not correctly identify if the table exists.
   - The Hive command being run when `partition` is not None may not return the desired result.

3. The cause of the bug is that the buggy function is not correctly parsing the output of the Hive commands to determine if the table exists. This leads to incorrect handling of tables and partitions, resulting in failed test cases.

4. To fix the bug, we need to update the logic in the `table_exists` function to properly check for the existence of the table in the Hive database based on the output of the Hive commands. We should ensure that the check is accurate and handles both cases where a partition is provided and when it is not.

5. Here is the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
        return table in stdout.split("\n") if stdout else False
    
    else:
        partition_spec = self.partition_spec(partition)
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use {0}; show partitions {1} partition (%s)""".format(database, table, partition_spec))
        return len(stdout.strip()) > 0  # Check if stdout contains any partitions

```

By splitting the stdout by '\n', we can check if the table name exists in the list of tables returned by the Hive command. For the partition check, we strip the stdout and check if it contains any partition information.

This corrected version should now pass the failing test cases.
