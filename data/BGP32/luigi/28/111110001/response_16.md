### Analysis:
- The buggy function `table_exists` in the `HiveCommandClient` class is checking if a table exists in a given database with an optional partition.
- The function uses `run_hive_cmd` function to run Hive commands.
- In the failing test, when a table exists, the function is expected to return `True`, but it is actually returning `False`.
- The error message indicates that the test is failing because `False` is not equal to `True`.

### Bug Location:
The issue is likely in the logic where the function is processing the output of the `run_hive_cmd` command and checking for the presence of the table name.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is caused by the incorrect logic in the `table_exists` function when checking if the table exists in the database. The logic is incorrectly evaluating the condition based on the presence of the table name in the command output.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to properly parse and check the output of the `run_hive_cmd` command to determine if the table exists in the database.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
Here is the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
        return table in stdout.split('\n')[1:] if stdout else False
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                        (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
        return bool(stdout)
```

In the corrected version:
- The return statement for the case where `partition` is `None` now checks if the table is present in the output by splitting the lines and checking the table name.
- The return statement for the case where `partition` is not `None` now returns `True` if the `stdout` is not empty (indicating table exists) and `False` otherwise.

By using this corrected logic, the function should now return `True` when the table exists in the database.
