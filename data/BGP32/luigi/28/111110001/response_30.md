## Analysis:
1. The `table_exists()` function in the `HiveCommandClient` class is supposed to check if a table exists in a specified database partition.
2. The function is calling the `run_hive_cmd()` function to execute Hive commands and check for the presence of the table.
3. The bug is likely occurring because the `run_hive_cmd()` function is returning incorrect values, leading to the wrong evaluation in the `table_exists()` function.
4. The failing tests show that the function is returning incorrect results in certain scenarios, leading to failed assertions.
   
## Bug:
The bug lies in the `table_exists()` function's evaluation logic based on the output received from `run_hive_cmd()` function.

## Fix:
1. Modify the evaluation logic to correctly check whether the table information is present in the output received from `run_hive_cmd()`.
2. Refactor the function to match the expected behavior based on the test cases provided.

## Corrected Version:
```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """

    def partition_spec(self, partition):
        # Please ignore the body of this function

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables;'.format(database))

            return stdout and table in stdout.splitlines()
        else:
            partition_str = ', '.join(["{0}='{1}'".format(k, v) for k, v in partition.items()])
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show partitions {1} partition ({2})'.format(database, table, partition_str))

            return bool(stdout)
```

By correcting the logic in the `table_exists()` function to split the stdout on newline characters and checking for table existence in lines individually, and enhancing the module's ability to handle partition specifications, the function should now correctly evaluate the table existence based on the output received from `run_hive_cmd()`.
