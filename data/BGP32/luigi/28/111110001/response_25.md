### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `table_exists` in the `HiveCommandClient` class of the `luigi.contrib.hive` module is checking for table existence in a Hive database using the `run_hive_cmd` function.
2. The function has two branches, one for checking table existence without a partition and another for checking with a partition. The first branch seems to be working correctly, but the second branch has a bug.
3. The bug in the second branch is causing the function to return `False` even when the table with the specified partition exists. This is evident from the failing test cases where the expected result is different from the actual result returned by the function.
4. To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the command executed in the second branch correctly identifies the table existence with the specified partition.
5. The corrected version of the function will check for the table existence with the partition correctly and return `True` if the table exists with the specified partition.

### Corrected Function:
```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: luigi/contrib/hive.py

class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):

    def partition_spec(self, partition):
        # Please ignore the body of this function

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
            return stdout and table in stdout
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                                (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
            return bool(stdout)  # Check if stdout is not empty
```

By correcting the function as shown above, it should now correctly detect the table existence with the specified partition and return `True` as expected in the failing test cases.
