### Analysis:
The buggy function `table_exists` is failing the test because it is not correctly handling the checking logic for whether a table exists or not in the Hive database. Specifically, the function is returning `True` when it should be returning `False` and vice-versa based on the information retrieved from the Hive database.

### Issues:
1. The buggy function is not correctly checking for the existence of a table in the Hive database.
2. The logic of checking the output response from `run_hive_cmd` is not accurate.

### Bug Cause:
The bug in the `table_exists` function is caused by incorrect logic when checking the output of the `run_hive_cmd` function. The function incorrectly uses the `stdout` response to determine if the table exists, leading to incorrect results.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to modify the logic in the `table_exists` function to accurately detect whether the table exists in the Hive database by checking the response from `run_hive_cmd`.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return bool(stdout)
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show partitions {1} partition ({2})'.format(database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        return bool(stdout)
```

After applying the changes, the corrected version of the function should be able to accurately determine whether a table exists in the Hive database based on the output from the `run_hive_cmd` function.
