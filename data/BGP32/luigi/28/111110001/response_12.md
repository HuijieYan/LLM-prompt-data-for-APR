## Analysis:
1. The buggy function `table_exists` in the `HiveCommandClient` class from the `luigi.contrib.hive` file is responsible for checking if a given table exists in a specified database. It uses the `run_hive_cmd` function to execute Hive commands and check the output.
2. The potential error location in the function lies in the logic that checks for the presence of the table in the output of the `run_hive_cmd` function call.
3. The bug occurs because the function incorrectly checks for the table name in the stdout output of the Hive commands. The function checks for an exact match of the table name, but in the test cases, the stdout includes additional information like new lines, which causes the function to fail.
4. To fix the bug, we need to modify the logic of checking the table name in the stdout to handle cases where the table name might be present along with additional text. We should also ensure case insensitivity in table name comparison.
5. Here is the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
# Fixed version of the buggy function
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
``` 

This corrected version of the `table_exists` function now performs case-insensitive checks for the table name in the stdout output, allowing it to pass the failing test cases.
