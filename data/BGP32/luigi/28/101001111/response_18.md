### Bug Analysis:
The buggy function `table_exists` in `HiveCommandClient` class is failing to correctly determine if a table exists in Hive due to a case sensitivity issue. The function checks for the existence of a table based on the exact case of the table name, which leads to failures when the table names have different cases. The GitHub issue highlights this problem and suggests making the `table_exists` function case-insensitive by comparing the table name with the lowercase version of the table names obtained from the Hive query output.

### Error Location:
The main error in the buggy function is the equality check between the provided table name and the table names fetched from Hive without accounting for case differences.

### Bug Cause:
The bug arises because the function does not consider the case sensitivity of table names in Hive. When the actual table name provided in the function call does not match the case of the table names returned from Hive, the equality check fails.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to modify the comparison in the `table_exists` function to be case-insensitive when checking for the existence of a table.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
Below is the corrected version of the `table_exists` function that addresses the case sensitivity issue:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                        (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

In the corrected version, we convert both the provided table name and the table names fetched from Hive to lowercase for comparison, ensuring a case-insensitive match.

By making this adjustment, the `table_exists` function will now accurately determine the existence of a table without being affected by case differences.
