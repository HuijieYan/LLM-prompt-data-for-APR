## Analysis:
The buggy `table_exists` function in the `HiveCommandClient` class is not handling the case insensitivity of table names properly. The issue arises when the function checks for the existence of a table by comparing the table name with the tables listed in the Hive output without considering case sensitivity.

The function expects the table names in the output to match exactly with the provided table name, which leads to test failures when the case of the table names differs.

To fix this issue, we need to modify the comparison to be case insensitive and ensure that the function works correctly with differently formatted table names.

## Bug Cause:
The bug in the `table_exists` function stems from the direct comparison of the provided table name with the tables listed in the Hive output without considering case sensitivity. When the table names have different cases, the comparison fails, leading to incorrect results and test failures.

## Bug Fix:
To fix the bug and make the `table_exists` function case insensitive, we need to modify the comparison logic to lower case both the provided table name and the table names in the Hive output before checking for existence.

Below is the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

            return bool(stdout)
```

By lowercasing both the table name and the tables in the output, the comparison becomes case insensitive, resolving the bug and aligning with the requested fix mentioned in the GitHub issue.
