### Potential Error Locations
1. The comparison `table in stdout` in the `if` condition.
2. The comparison between the `stdout` and boolean values `True` or `False`.

### Cause of the Bug
The bug is caused by a case-sensitivity issue when checking for table existence in Hive. The function compares the `table` name with the `stdout` output without considering case differences. If the table name is not in lowercase format, the comparison fails, leading to incorrect results. 

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to make the comparison case-insensitive. This can be achieved by converting both the `table` name and the `stdout` output to lowercase before comparing them.

### Corrected Version of the Function
```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                        (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        return bool(stdout)
```

By converting both the `table` and `stdout` to lowercase before comparison, the corrected function ensures that the table existence check is case-insensitive as desired. This fix addresses the issue reported in the GitHub bug reports.
