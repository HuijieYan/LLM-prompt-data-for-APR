### Analysis
The buggy function `table_exists` is designed to check if a table exists in a specified database. The bug arises from a case sensitivity issue when comparing the table name with the output of the Hive command. The GitHub issue indicates that table names can be returned as lowercase even if they were defined with mixed case or uppercase characters. Therefore, the function needs to perform a case-insensitive comparison to correctly determine the existence of the table.

### Bug Location
The bug originates from the comparison made in the `if` condition statements where the table name is directly compared with the output without considering case sensitivity.

### Bug Cause
The bug occurs because the `table_exists` function compares the table name directly to the output of the Hive command without considering case sensitivity. This leads to incorrect results when the table names have different case formats.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the comparison between the table name and the output of the Hive command is case-insensitive. One way to achieve this is by converting both strings to lowercase before comparison.

### Corrected Code
```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
    
            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                                (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
    
            if stdout:
                return True
            else:
                return False
```

### Summary
The bug in the `table_exists` function of the `HiveCommandClient` class has been addressed by modifying the comparison to be case-insensitive. This fix ensures that the function correctly determines the existence of the specified table in the given database, resolving the issue mentioned in the GitHub report.
