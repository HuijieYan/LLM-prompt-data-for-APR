### Bug Explanation

The buggy function `table_exists` in the `HiveCommandClient` class of the `luigi/contrib/hive.py` file fails to correctly check the existence of tables due to case sensitivity issues in the table names. The function uses the `stdout` variable returned from `run_hive_cmd` to determine if the table exists in the database, but it compares `table` directly with `stdout`, leading to failures when the case of the table name doesn't match the case in the database.

### Bug Fix Strategy

To fix this bug, the function needs to compare the lowercase version of the `table` with the lowercase version of the `stdout` to make the comparison case-insensitive. By converting both to lowercase before comparison, the function can accurately detect if the table exists irrespective of the case used.

### Corrected Version

Here is the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
    
            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                                (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
    
            if stdout:
                return True
            else:
                return False
```

In this corrected version, both `table` and `stdout` are converted to lowercase using the `lower()` function before comparison, resolving the case sensitivity issue. This change aligns with the suggested fix mentioned in the GitHub issue.
