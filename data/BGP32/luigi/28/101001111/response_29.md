The bug in the `table_exists` function is caused by the fact that it does a direct comparison between the `table` name and the output `stdout`. Since Hive is case-insensitive, this causes discrepancies when comparing tables with different cases.

To fix this bug, we should modify the comparison to be case-insensitive. We can achieve this by converting both the `table` name and the `stdout` to lowercase before performing the comparison.

Here is the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: luigi/contrib/hive.py

# This function from the same file, but not the same class, is called by the buggy function
def run_hive_cmd(hivecmd, check_return_code=True):
    # Please ignore the body of this function

# The declaration of the class containing the buggy function
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    # This function from the same class is called by the buggy function
    def partition_spec(self, partition):
        # Please ignore the body of this function

    # corrected version of the buggy function
    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                                (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

            if stdout:
                return True
            else:
                return False
```

With this correction, the `table_exists` function will now perform a case-insensitive comparison between the table name and the output from Hive, resolving the issue reported on GitHub.
