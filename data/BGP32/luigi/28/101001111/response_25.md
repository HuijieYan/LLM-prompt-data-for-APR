The buggy function `table_exists` in the `HiveCommandClient` class is not case insensitive when checking for table existence in Hive. This results in failing tests when tables are defined with capitalized names as Hive returns them in lowercase. To fix this bug, we need to modify the comparison between the table name and the stdout output to be case insensitive.

Here is the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: luigi/contrib/hive.py

def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

In the corrected version, we use the `lower()` function to convert both the `table` name and the `stdout` output to lowercase before comparing them. This change makes the comparison case insensitive and aligns with the proposed fix in the GitHub issue.

By implementing this modification, the `table_exists` function will now correctly handle tables with different case combinations, resolving the bug reported in the GitHub issue and passing the failing tests.
