### Bug Analysis:
The buggy function `table_exists` in the `HiveCommandClient` class is supposed to check if a table exists in a database. However, the issue arises because it does a case-sensitive comparison between the provided table name and the table names returned from Hive, which are converted to lowercase. This leads to test failures when the provided table name and the returned table names are in different cases.

### Bug Location:
The bug is located in the conditional checks where the `table` parameter is compared with the `stdout` output. The comparison should be case-insensitive to account for variations in table name cases.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is caused by the case-sensitive comparison between the table name provided (`table`) and the table names returned in lowercase (`stdout`). This leads to incorrect results when comparing table names with different cases.

### Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, the comparison between the `table` parameter and the `stdout` output should be made case-insensitive. By converting both strings to lowercase before comparison, the function will correctly determine if the table exists irrespective of the case.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

In the corrected version, both the `table` parameter and the `stdout` output are converted to lowercase using the `lower()` method before comparison. This ensures a case-insensitive check for table existence, addressing the bug reported on GitHub.
