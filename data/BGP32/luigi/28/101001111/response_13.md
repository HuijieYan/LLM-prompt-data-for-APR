Based on the runtime values and expected values provided, it seems the issue lies in the case sensitivity of comparing the table name with the output received from the `run_hive_cmd` function. The `table_exists` function currently performs a direct comparison between the provided table name and the output, which can lead to mismatches due to case sensitivity in table names.

To fix the bug, we need to make the comparison case insensitive by converting both the table name and the output to lowercase before comparison.

Here is the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                        (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

By converting both the `table` and `stdout` to lowercase before comparison, we ensure that case sensitivity does not impact the function's behavior, addressing the issue reported on GitHub.
