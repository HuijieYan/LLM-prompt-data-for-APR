Based on the runtime and expected values provided, the issue with the `table_exists` function is that it does not handle case sensitivity properly when checking for table existence in Hive. The function should compare the lowercase version of the table name with the lowercase version of the tables returned by Hive to ensure a match.

The strategy for fixing the bug is to modify the comparison statement to use lowercase versions of both table names.

Here is the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
# The declaration of the class containing the corrected function
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    
    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
    
            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                                (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
    
            if stdout:
                return True
            else:
                return False
```

This corrected version will handle the case sensitivity issue described in the GitHub issue and align with the expected values provided for the failing test cases.
