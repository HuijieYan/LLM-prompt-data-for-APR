### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `table_exists` in the `HiveCommandClient` class checks if a table exists in the database by running a Hive command based on the provided parameters.
2. The issue arises when the table names are case-sensitive and the function does not handle case insensitivity properly.
3. The GitHub issue mentions that the function should be case-insensitive when checking for table existence.
4. The bug occurs due to a direct comparison between the table name and the output from `run_hive_cmd`, which can lead to case-sensitive mismatches.
5. To fix the bug, we should compare the lowercase versions of both the table name and the output to make the comparison case-insensitive.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Modify the buggy function to convert the table name to lowercase before checking its existence in the output.
2. Similarly, convert the output from `run_hive_cmd` to lowercase to ensure a case-insensitive comparison.
3. Update the `table_exists` function to fulfill the expected behavior described in the GitHub issue.

### Corrected Version:
```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: luigi/contrib/hive.py

# This function from the same file, but not the same class, is called by the buggy function
def run_hive_cmd(hivecmd, check_return_code=True):
    # Please ignore the body of this function

# The declaration of the class containing the corrected function
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    # This function from the same class is called by the buggy function
    def partition_spec(self, partition):
        # Please ignore the body of this function

    # Corrected version of the buggy function
    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
    
            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                                (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
    
            if stdout:
                return True
            else:
                return False
```

### Summary:
The corrected version of the `table_exists` function now ensures case-insensitive checks for table existence by converting both the table name and the output to lowercase before comparison. This modification addresses the bug reported in the GitHub issue and aligns the function's behavior with the expected input/output values.
