The issue with the buggy function `table_exists` is that it compares the table name in a case-sensitive manner with the table names returned from Hive, leading to test failures when there are case differences. To resolve this, we need to make the comparison case-insensitive by converting both the table name and the table names in the output to lowercase before checking for existence.

Here is the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

By converting both the `table` and the `stdout` to lowercase before comparison, we ensure a case-insensitive check for table existence. This corrected version aligns with the expected behaviors specified in the failing test cases and also addresses the GitHub issue related to making `table_exists` case-insensitive.
