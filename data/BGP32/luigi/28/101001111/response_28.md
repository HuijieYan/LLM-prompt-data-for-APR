The bug in the `table_exists` function arises from the case sensitivity when checking if a table exists in Hive. The function compares the table name in a case-sensitive way against the output from the Hive command, causing the function to fail when encountering tables with different casing.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the comparison to be case insensitive. We can achieve this by converting both the table name and the output from Hive to lowercase before comparing them.

Here is the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
    
        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                        (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

By converting both the table name and the output to lowercase before comparison, we ensure that the function behaves correctly even with different casing of table names in Hive. This change addresses the issue reported in the GitHub bug report and should now provide the expected behavior for the `table_exists` function.
