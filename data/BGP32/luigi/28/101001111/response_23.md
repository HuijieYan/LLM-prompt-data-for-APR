To fix the bug in the `table_exists` function, we need to update the comparison between the table name and the stdout to make it case insensitive. The issue reported on GitHub suggests that table names might be returned in lowercase by Hive even if they were defined in a different case. Therefore, comparing the table name in lowercase with the stdout will ensure correct detection of existing tables without being case sensitive.

Here is the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    
    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

            if stdout:
                return True
            else:
                return False
```

By comparing both the table name and the stdout in lowercase, the function will be able to handle case variations effectively, as suggested in the GitHub issue. Now, the `table_exists` function is updated to be case insensitive when checking for the existence of tables in Hive.
