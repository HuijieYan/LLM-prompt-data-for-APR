### Analysis:
The bug in the `table_exists` function is due to the case sensitivity when checking if a table exists in Hive. The function compares the table name provided with the tables shown by Hive without considering case sensitivity.

### Error Location:
The error lies in the comparison of the table names in the `stdout` with the provided table name without taking into account case sensitivity.

### Bug Cause:
1. In the first case below, the table name is lowercase, but the stdout is all uppercase. The comparison does not handle case insensitivity.
2. In the second case, the table name contains a mix of uppercase and lowercase characters, while the stdout is all lowercase. Again, the comparison is case-sensitive.
3. The third and fourth cases have similar issues with mismatched cases in table names and stdout.

### Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, the comparison between the table name and the tables in Hive needs to be case insensitive. We can use the lower() function for both the `table` variable and the `stdout` variable to make the comparison case insensitive.

### Updated Code:
```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: luigi/contrib/hive.py

# This function from the same file, but not the same class, is called by the buggy function
def run_hive_cmd(hivecmd, check_return_code=True):
    # Please ignore the body of this function

# The declaration of the class containing the buggy function
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    # This function from the same class is called by the buggy function
    def partition_spec(self, partition):
        # Please ignore the body of this function

    # Updated fixed version of the buggy function
    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
    
            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                                (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
    
            if stdout:
                return True
            else:
                return False
```

By modifying the comparison to be case insensitive by converting both the `table` and `stdout` to lowercase, we ensure that the function correctly identifies the existence of the table regardless of case sensitivity.
