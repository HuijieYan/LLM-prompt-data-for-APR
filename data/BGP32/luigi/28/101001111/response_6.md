The bug in the `table_exists` function is related to case sensitivity when checking for table existence in Hive. The function compares the table name with the tables listed in stdout without considering case differences, leading to incorrect results in some cases.

To fix the bug, you should convert both the table name and the tables listed in stdout to lowercase before comparison to ensure case insensitivity.

Here is the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
# The buggy function has been fixed here
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                                (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
            return bool(stdout)
```

By converting both `table` and `stdout` to lowercase before comparison, the function now correctly checks for the existence of the table case-insensitively, addressing the issue mentioned in the GitHub report.

This corrected version should now satisfy the expected input/output values and resolve the case sensitivity problem reported in the GitHub issue.
