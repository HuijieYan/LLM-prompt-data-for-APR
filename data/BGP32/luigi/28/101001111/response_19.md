### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `table_exists` checks if a given table exists in a database by running a Hive command and looking for the table name in the output. The issue arises because the table name comparison is case-sensitive, leading to failures when the case of the table name mismatches.
2. The GitHub issue highlights that table names in Hive are case-insensitive, which causes problems when comparing them in the function.
3. The bug occurs because the function directly compares the table name without considering the case sensitivity of Hive table names. This results in incorrect outputs when the table names have different cases.
4. To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the comparison between the expected table name and the names returned by Hive is case-insensitive.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Normalize the table name and the output from Hive to lowercase before comparison to make the function case-insensitive.
2. Update the comparison logic to check if the normalized table name is in the normalized output from Hive.
3. Implement these changes to address the bug and align with the GitHub issue's suggestion.

### Corrected Version:
```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: luigi/contrib/hive.py

def run_hive_cmd(hivecmd, check_return_code=True):
    # Please ignore the body of this function

class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    def partition_spec(self, partition):
        # Please ignore the body of this function

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
    
            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()  # Case-insensitive comparison
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                                (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
    
            if stdout:
                return True
            else:
                return False
```

By normalizing the table name and the output to lowercase before comparison, the corrected function ensures a case-insensitive check for table existence in Hive. This modification aligns with the GitHub issue's suggestion to make `table_exists` case-insensitive.
