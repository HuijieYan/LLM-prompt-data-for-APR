## Bug Analysis
The buggy function `table_exists` in the `HiveCommandClient` class of the `hive.py` file in `luigi` does not handle case sensitivity properly when checking if a table exists in Hive. The function compares the table name directly against the output from Hive, which may have different case conventions. This leads to incorrect results when the table names have different cases.

## Bug Location
The bug is located in the comparison part of the function:
```python
return stdout and table in stdout
```
and
```python
if stdout:
    return True
else:
    return False
```

## Cause of the Bug
The bug arises from the direct comparison of the `table` variable with the `stdout` output from Hive. Since Hive is case-insensitive, the table names may be returned in a different case format than provided. Therefore, a case-insensitive comparison should be used to ensure correct behavior.

## Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, implement a case-insensitive comparison by converting both the table name and the output from Hive to lowercase before comparison. This will ensure that the comparison is not affected by different case conventions.

## Corrected Version of the Function
```python
import re

# The relative path of the corrected file: luigi/contrib/hive.py

# The declaration of the class containing the corrected function
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    # this is the corrected function
    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
            return bool(stdout)

```

By converting both the `table` and `stdout` to lowercase before comparison, the corrected function ensures that the comparison is case-insensitive. This resolves the issue reported on GitHub and ensures the function behaves correctly for different case conventions of table names in Hive.
