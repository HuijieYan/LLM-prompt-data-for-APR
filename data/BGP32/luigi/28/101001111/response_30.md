After analyzing the buggy function and the provided information, it seems that the bug lies in the comparison of the table name with the tables listed in the output obtained from Hive. Since Hive is case insensitive, the comparison should also be case insensitive to account for potential mismatches due to case differences.

To fix the bug and address the GitHub issue, we need to modify the comparison between the table name and the tables listed in the output to be case insensitive.

Here is the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                               (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

In this corrected version, we use the `lower()` method to convert both the table name and the tables listed in the output to lowercase before the comparison, ensuring a case-insensitive check for table existence in Hive.

This fix should address the failing tests and align with the expected input/output values while also resolving the GitHub issue related to making the `table_exists` function case insensitive.
