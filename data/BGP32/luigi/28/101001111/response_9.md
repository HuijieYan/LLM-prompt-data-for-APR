The bug in the `table_exists` function is due to case sensitivity when checking if a table exists in Hive. The function compares the table name directly with the output from Hive which might be in lowercase, leading to false negatives.

To fix the bug, we need to make the comparison case insensitive by converting both the table name and the output to lowercase before comparison.

Here is the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: luigi/contrib/hive.py

# The corrected version of the buggy function
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("use {0}; show partitions {1} partition ({2});".format(database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

By converting both `table` and `stdout` to lowercase before comparison, the function will now correctly identify whether the table exists in a case-insensitive manner.

This fix addresses the issue reported on GitHub related to making the `table_exists` function case insensitive.
