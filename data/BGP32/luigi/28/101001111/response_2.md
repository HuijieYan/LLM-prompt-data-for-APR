The bug in the `table_exists` function arises from a case sensitivity issue when checking the existence of tables in Hive. The function compares the table name directly with the output from Hive, which can lead to failures due to case differences.

To fix the bug, we should modify the comparison to be case insensitive by converting both the table name and the output from Hive to lowercase before comparison.

Here is the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

By converting both the table name and the output to lowercase before comparison, we ensure that the function is case insensitive.

This correction aligns with the suggested fix in the GitHub issue, where the case insensitivity problem was identified and a solution was provided to make the comparison between the table name and the Hive output insensitive to case differences.
