To fix the bug in the `table_exists` function, we need to make the comparison between the table name and the values from stdout case-insensitive. The current implementation directly checks if the table name is in the stdout, but due to case sensitivity in the check, it fails for different cases of table names.

To address this issue, we need to modify the comparison to make it insensitive to the case of the table names. This can be achieved by converting both the table name and the values from stdout to lowercase before comparison.

Here is the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:
```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                        (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        return bool(stdout)
```

In this corrected version:
- We convert both the `table` name and the `stdout` values to lowercase before comparing them to make it a case-insensitive comparison.
- If `partition` is not None, we directly return the boolean value of `stdout` to simplify the logic.

By making this change, the function `table_exists` should pass the failing test cases and satisfy the expected input/output values. Additionally, it addresses the reported GitHub issue regarding making the table exists check case-insensitive.
