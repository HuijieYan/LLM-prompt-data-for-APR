To fix the bug in the `table_exists` function, we need to ensure that the table name comparison is case-insensitive. Currently, the function compares the table name directly with the output from the Hive command, leading to failures when the case differs.

Here is an updated version of the `table_exists` method that addresses the case-insensitivity issue:

```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
            return bool(stdout)
```

By converting both the table name and the output to lowercase before comparison, the function will now correctly handle case differences and pass the failing tests.

This fix aligns with the suggested solution in the GitHub issue #896, which recommended making the `table_exists` function case-insensitive.

By applying this correction, the `table_exists` function should now pass the failing test cases and properly handle table name comparisons in a case-insensitive manner.
