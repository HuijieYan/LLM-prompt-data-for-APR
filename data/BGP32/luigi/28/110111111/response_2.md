To fix the bug in the `table_exists` function of the `HiveCommandClient` class, the comparison between the table name and the tables listed in the output should be case-insensitive. This will ensure that tables with different case formats are correctly identified.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: luigi/contrib/hive.py

# The declaration of the class containing the buggy function
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                                (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

            if stdout:
                return True
            else:
                return False
```

By modifying the return statement to compare the lowercase versions of the table name and the tables listed in the output, the function will now correctly handle case sensitivity issues. This change ensures that tables are found regardless of their case format.

With this correction, the `table_exists` function should now pass the failing test cases and meet the expected input/output values. Additionally, this fix aligns with the GitHub issue raised regarding making the `table_exists` function case-insensitive.
