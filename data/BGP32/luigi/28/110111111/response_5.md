To fix the bug in the `table_exists` function, we need to make it case insensitive when comparing the table name with the tables from the Hive output. This issue has been reported on GitHub and a solution has been suggested to check `table.lower()` in `stdout.lower()`.

Below is the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

            return bool(stdout)
```

By converting both the table names to lower case before comparing them, the function will now correctly identify whether a table exists in a case-insensitive manner, as required by the failing tests. This change addresses the reported GitHub issue and aligns with the suggested solution.
