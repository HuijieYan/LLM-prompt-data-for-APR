## Correction

To address the issue with the `table_exists` function being case-sensitive, we need to modify the function so that it compares the table name in a case-insensitive manner. This can be achieved by converting both the table name and the output from the `run_hive_cmd` function to lowercase before comparison.

Here is the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                                (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

            return bool(stdout)  # No need to check for a condition, just return the boolean value

```

By converting both the `table` and `stdout` strings to lowercase before comparison, we ensure that the function is case-insensitive when checking for table existence.

This correction should resolve the failing tests and address the GitHub issue related to making the `table_exists` function case-insensitive.
