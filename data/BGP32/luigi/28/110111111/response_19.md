### Fixing the Bug

The bug in the `table_exists` function stems from a case sensitivity issue when comparing the table name with the output from the `run_hive_cmd` function. To fix this bug, we need to make the comparison case insensitive by converting both the table name and the output to lowercase before comparison.

Here's the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

            if stdout:
                return True
            else:
                return False
```

This corrected version ensures that the comparison between the table name and the output is case insensitive, resolving the failing tests and the GitHub issue regarding the case sensitivity problem in the `table_exists` function.

By converting both the table name and the output to lowercase before comparing, we address the issue of case sensitivity, allowing the function to correctly determine the existence of the table regardless of the case of the table name.
