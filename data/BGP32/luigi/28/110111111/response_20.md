To fix the bug in the `table_exists` function, we need to make the comparison case insensitive by converting both `table` and `stdout` to lowercase before checking. This will address the issue raised in the GitHub report and ensure that the function behaves correctly.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

            return bool(stdout)
```

The main change is to convert both `table` and `stdout` to lowercase using the `lower()` function before performing the comparison. This modification makes the comparison case-insensitive and ensures that the function returns the correct results.

With this corrected version, the function should now pass the failing test cases and align with the expected inputs/outputs and the GitHub fix for making `table_exists` case insensitive.
