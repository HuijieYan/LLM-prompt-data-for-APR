To address the bug in the `table_exists` function, we need to make the comparison case-insensitive by converting both `table` and `stdout` to lowercase before performing the check. This will ensure that the function behaves correctly regardless of the case of the table names.

Here is a corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                                (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
            return bool(stdout)
```

By converting both `table` and `stdout` to lowercase using the `lower()` function before the comparison, we ensure that the comparison is case-insensitive as desired.

This corrected version should pass the failing tests and meet the expected input/output values as outlined in the cases provided. It also aligns with the GitHub issue discussing the need to make `table_exists` case insensitive.
