To fix the bug in the `table_exists` function in the `HiveCommandClient` class, we need to make the comparison case-insensitive by converting both the table name and the output from the `run_hive_cmd` to lowercase before checking for existence.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

            return bool(stdout)
```

This corrected version ensures that both the table name and the output from `run_hive_cmd` are converted to lowercase before the comparison. This modification will resolve the case sensitivity issue and make the function pass the failing test cases.

The fix addresses the GitHub issue #896, which suggests making the `table_exists` function case-insensitive by checking the output against the lowercase table name to avoid case-related problems.

By implementing this fix, the `table_exists` function in the `HiveCommandClient` class will behave as expected and pass the failing tests provided.
