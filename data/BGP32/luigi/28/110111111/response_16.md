To fix the bug in the `table_exists` function, we need to make the comparison case insensitive by converting both `table` and `stdout` to lowercase before checking if `table` is in `stdout`.

Here is the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: luigi/contrib/hive.py

# The corrected version of the buggy function
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

            if stdout:
                return True
            else:
                return False
```

By converting both `table` and `stdout` to lowercase before comparison, we ensure that the check is case insensitive, which addresses the issue raised in GitHub and allows the failing tests to pass as expected.

This modification will fix the comparison issue and make the `table_exists` function case insensitive.
