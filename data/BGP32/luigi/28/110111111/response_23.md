To fix the bug in the `table_exists` function, we need to address the case-sensitivity when comparing the table names in the stdout. This bug causes the test cases to fail when expecting case-insensitive table existence checks.

The bug arises due to the direct comparison of the table name with the output obtained from Hive commands, which may not match due to case differences. To fix this, we need to ensure a case-insensitive comparison between the table name and the output from Hive commands.

Here is the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: luigi/contrib/hive.py

# The declaration of the class containing the corrected function
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd(
                """use %s; show partitions %s partition (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

            return bool(stdout)
```

By adjusting the comparison to check for case-insensitive matches (using `lower()`), we ensure that the table names are compared correctly regardless of case. This fix aligns with the GitHub issue suggesting that table existence checks should be case insensitive.

With the corrected function, the failing tests should now pass without any `AssertionError` related to the case sensitivity of the table names in the `table_exists` function. This fix resolves the issue identified in the GitHub thread and makes the function behavior consistent with the expected case-insensitive table existence checks.
