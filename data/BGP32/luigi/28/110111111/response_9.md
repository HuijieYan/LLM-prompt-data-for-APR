### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `table_exists` in the `HiveCommandClient` class within `luigi/contrib/hive.py` is failing the test cases due to case sensitivity when checking for table existence.
2. The function uses `run_hive_cmd` to execute Hive commands and check for table existence.
3. The failing tests indicate that the function is not handling case sensitivity correctly, leading to assertion errors when verifying the table existence.
4. To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the comparison between the table name and the output from Hive is case insensitive.

### Bug Cause:
The buggy function `table_exists` compares the name of the table with the output from Hive without considering case sensitivity. This leads to incorrect results when the table names don't match case-wise.

### Bug Fix:
To fix the bug, we should modify the function to ensure a case-insensitive comparison when checking for table existence.

### Updated Buggy Function:
```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

            return bool(stdout)
```

By converting both the table name and the output from Hive to lowercase before comparison, the function now performs a case-insensitive check for table existence.

This fix should resolve the failing test cases and address the case sensitivity issue reported on GitHub (Issue #896).
