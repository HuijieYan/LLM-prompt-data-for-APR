To fix the bug in the `table_exists` function and address the issue highlighted on GitHub regarding case insensitivity, we need to update the function to compare the table name in a case-insensitive manner. Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: luigi/contrib/hive.py

# The declaration of the class containing the buggy function
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

            return stdout and table.lower() in map(str.lower, stdout.splitlines())
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                                (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

            if stdout:
                return True
            else:
                return False
```

In the corrected version:
- We modified the return statement for case insensitive comparison by converting the table name to lowercase and then checking if it exists in the list of table names obtained from `stdout` after converting them to lowercase as well.
- This change ensures that the function can perform a case-insensitive check for table existence, addressing the issue mentioned in the GitHub problem statement.

By making this adjustment, the `table_exists` function should now pass the failing tests and meet the expected input/output values provided in the detailed description.
