To fix the bug in the `table_exists` function, we need to address the case sensitivity issue. The bug occurs because the function checks for an exact match between the table name and the output from the command, which can cause failures due to case differences. To resolve this, we should convert both the table name and the command output to lowercase before comparing them.

Here is the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: luigi/contrib/hive.py

class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                                (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

            if stdout:
                return True
            else:
                return False
```

By converting both the table name and the command output to lowercase before comparison, the function will now be case insensitive, allowing it to pass the failing test cases. This fix also aligns with the suggested solution in the GitHub issue #896, addressing the case sensitivity issue.

The corrected function should now pass the failing tests and match the expected input/output values provided for each test case.
