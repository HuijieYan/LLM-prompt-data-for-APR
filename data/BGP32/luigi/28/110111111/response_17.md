To fix the bug in the `table_exists` function, we need to make the comparison case-insensitive by converting both the table name and the output to lowercase. This will ensure that the function correctly identifies the table's existence regardless of the case.

Here is the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: luigi/contrib/hive.py

# The declaration of the class containing the buggy function
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                                (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

            if stdout:
                return True
            else:
                return False
```

By converting both the table name and the output to lowercase, we ensure a case-insensitive comparison, which will fix the failing tests and address the issue reported on GitHub.

This corrected version of the function should now pass the failing test cases and satisfy the expected input/output values.
