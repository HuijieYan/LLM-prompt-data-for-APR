To fix the bug in the `table_exists` function, we need to ensure that the comparison between the table name and the tables listed in the `stdout` is case insensitive. This will ensure that the function behaves correctly for different capitalization styles of table names.

Here is a corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

            return bool(stdout)
```

Explanation:
- Changed the comparison to be case-insensitive by converting both the table name and the table names in `stdout` to lowercase using `table.lower()` and `stdout.lower()`.
- Removed the unnecessary conditional statements to simplify the code and make it more readable.

By making this change, the `table_exists` function should now pass the failing tests and behave correctly for different capitalization styles of table names. This fix also addresses the GitHub issue related to making the `table_exists` function case insensitive.
