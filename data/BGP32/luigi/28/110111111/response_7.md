To fix the bug in the `table_exists` function, we need to make the comparison case-insensitive by converting both `table` and `stdout` to lowercase before performing the check. This change will align with the GitHub issue's suggestion to make the function case-insensitive.

Here is the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

This updated version will ensure that the comparison between the table name and tables retrieved from `stdout` is done in a case-insensitive manner. The function should now pass all the failing tests and meet the expected input/output values.
