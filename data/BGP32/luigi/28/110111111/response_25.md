To fix the bug in the `table_exists` function, we need to ensure that the comparison between the table name and the names retrieved from the `stdout` is case insensitive. The issue reported on GitHub also suggests this approach to resolve the problem.

The corrected version of the function can be updated as follows:

```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

            return stdout and table.lower() in map(str.lower, stdout.splitlines())
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                                (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

            if stdout:
                return True
            else:
                return False
```

By converting both the table name and the names from the `stdout` to lowercase, we ensure a case-insensitive comparison. This modification should resolve the failing test cases and meet the expected input/output values.

After applying this fix, the function should now pass the failing tests as described.
