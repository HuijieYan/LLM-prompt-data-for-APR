To fix the bug in the `table_exists` function, we need to make the comparison case insensitive. Currently, the function checks for an exact match between the provided table name and the tables returned by the Hive command, which leads to test failures when there are differences in case.

Here is the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: luigi/contrib/hive.py

# The declaration of the class containing the buggy function
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """
    
    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
    
            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                                (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
    
            return bool(stdout)
```

By converting both the `table` and `stdout` to lowercase during comparison, we make the check case insensitive, resolving the issue reported in the failing tests and GitHub.

The corrected function should now pass all the failing tests provided, as it will correctly handle case differences in table names returned by the Hive command.

By incorporating this fix, the issue reported on GitHub (#896) can be addressed, fulfilling the need for case-insensitive comparisons in the `table_exists` function.
