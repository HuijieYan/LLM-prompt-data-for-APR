The bug in the `table_exists` function is that it does not handle case insensitivity when comparing the table name from the `stdout` with the input table name. This causes the test cases to fail when comparing table names with different cases. To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the comparison is case insensitive by converting both strings to lowercase before comparison.

Here is the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                                (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
            return bool(stdout)
```

By converting both `table` and `stdout` to lowercase before the comparison, we ensure that the comparison is case insensitive. This change will make the `table_exists` function pass the failing test cases and address the issue raised in the GitHub discussions.
