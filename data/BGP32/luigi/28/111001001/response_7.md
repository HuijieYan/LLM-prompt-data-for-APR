### Analysis
The buggy function `table_exists()` is designed to check if a table exists in a given database. The function uses the `run_hive_cmd()` function to execute Hive commands and check for the existence of the table.

The bug seems to be related to how the function processes the output from the `run_hive_cmd()` function. Specifically, the function checks if the table name is directly in the output string which could lead to false positives or negatives depending on the contents of the output.

### Bug Explanation
In Case 2 and Case 4, the function fails because the function does a simple string check (`table in stdout`) to determine if the table exists in the database. This approach leads to incorrect results when the output contains multiple entries or irrelevant data alongside the table name.

In Case 1 and Case 3, the function returns incorrect results because it directly checks for the existence of the entire partition specification in the output (`return True if stdout else False`). This method does not accurately determine if the table exists, leading to bugs.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug
To fix the bug, we should modify the function to parse the output from `run_hive_cmd()` more accurately. Instead of a simple string check, we should check if the table name specifically exists in the returned data in a format that matches table listings.

### Corrected Version
```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables in {1};'.format(database, table))
        return any(line.strip() == table for line in stdout.strip().split("\n"))
    else:
        partition_spec_output = self.partition_spec(partition)
        if partition_spec_output:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, partition_spec_output))
            return True if stdout else False
        else:
            return False
```

In the corrected version:
1. When checking for table existence without a partition, the function splits the output by line and checks each entry against the table name (using `any` to return `True` if any line matches).
2. When checking with a partition, it first gets the partition specification output and then checks for the existence of the specific partition.
