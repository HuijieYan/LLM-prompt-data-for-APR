### Analysis
The buggy function `table_exists` checks if a table exists in a given database using Hive commands. The function calls `run_hive_cmd` to execute the command and then checks the output for the presence of the table.

The bug seems to be related to the comparison between the table name and the output of the Hive command. The function checks if the table name is in the stdout output, which may lead to incorrect results due to case sensitivity or formatting issues.

### Bug Explanation
1. **Case Sensitivity**: The comparison `table in stdout` is case-sensitive. If the table name in the Hive output does not match exactly (including case), the function may incorrectly report that the table does not exist.
   
2. **Formatting**: In Case 2 and Case 4, the stdout contains additional characters (`\n` in between) which will not match the exact table name leading to incorrect results.
   
3. **Partition Condition**: In the partitioned table case, the condition `if stdout:` is not sufficient to determine if the table exists as the Hive command returns output even if the table does not exist.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug
1. **Case Insensitive Check**: Modify the comparison to be case-insensitive to ensure accurate results.
   
2. **Exact Match Check**: Ensure that the table name extracted from the Hive output matches exactly without additional characters.
   
3. **Add Specific Check for Table Existence**: Check for a specific output in the Hive command's result to determine if the table exists.

### Corrected Version

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in map(str.lower, stdout.split())
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                        (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if "No partition" not in stdout: # Specific check for table existence
            return True
        else:
            return False
``` 

With these modifications, the function now performs a case-insensitive check for the table name in the output and includes a specific check to confirm the table's existence in the case of a partitioned table.
