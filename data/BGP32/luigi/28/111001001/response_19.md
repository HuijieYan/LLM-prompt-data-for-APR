### Analysis
The `table_exists` function in the `HiveCommandClient` class is supposed to check if a table exists in a specified database and partition. However, there are issues in how the `stdout` variable is being checked for the existence of the table. The bug lies in the condition checking part where it does not handle the case when the table name in the stdout is formated differently than the table name being checked.

### Bug
The bug occurs when the table name in the `stdout` does not match the input table name properly due to formatting or case sensitivity issues. The function checks for an exact match of the input table name in the `stdout`, but this may fail due to differences in formatting such as case sensitivity.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug
To address the bug, we need to modify the comparison of the table names to handle case insensitivity and any extra characters in the `stdout` output. One way to fix this is by converting both the input table name and the tables in the `stdout` to a common format, such as lowercase, before performing the comparison.

### Corrected Version
```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
    
        return stdout and table.lower() in map(str.lower, stdout.split())
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
    
        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

In the corrected version, both the input table name and the table names in the `stdout` output are converted to lowercase before comparing them. Additionally, the `stdout` output is split into a list of table names to check if the input table name exists in that list. The fix ensures that the comparison is case insensitive and handles any additional characters or formatting differences in the table names.
