### Analysis:
The buggy function `table_exists` is utilizing the `run_hive_cmd` function to check if a table exists in a given database. In the first `if` block, it searches for the table directly, while in the `else` block, it tries to find the table with a specific partition. The bug seems to be related to how the table name is checked in the stdout.

### Bug:
The bug occurs in the conditional check for the existence of the table in the `stdout` variable. The comparison `table in stdout` is case-sensitive, which causes the function to incorrectly determine the presence of the table in the output.

### Fix:
To fix the bug, we need to make the comparison case-insensitive when checking for the table name in the `stdout` variable. We can achieve this by converting both the table name and the `stdout` to lowercase before the comparison.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
``` 

By converting both the table name and `stdout` to lowercase before the comparison, we ensure a case-insensitive check for the table's existence.
