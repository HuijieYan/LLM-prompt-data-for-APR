### Analysis
The buggy function `table_exists` is intended to check if a table exists in a given database. It uses the `run_hive_cmd` function to execute Hive commands. The bug seems to be related to how the function checks for the existence of the table in the output of the Hive command.

### Bug
The bug occurs in the conditional check for the existence of the table in the stdout variable. The function currently only checks if the table name is directly in the stdout, which can lead to false positives if the table name is a substring of another table name listed in the output.

### Fix
Instead of directly checking if the table name is in the stdout, it would be more reliable to split the stdout by lines and then check if the exact table name is among the retrieved tables.

### Corrected Version
```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables in {0} like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return any(t.strip().lower() == table.strip().lower() for t in stdout.split('\n'))
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        return bool(stdout)
``` 

This corrected version ensures that the function accurately checks for the existence of the table in the output of the Hive command.
