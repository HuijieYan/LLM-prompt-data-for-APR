### Bug analysis
The bug in the `table_exists` function arises from how the `stdout` variable is being checked to determine if the table exists. In the case where the table does exist, the function is not correctly checking the presence of the table name within the `stdout` output.

### Bug explanation
1. In the first `if` branch:
   - The function checks if the `table` name is in the `stdout` variable to determine if the table exists.
   - However, the check `table in stdout` is not reliable because the `stdout` variable may contain additional text besides just the table name, like in `Case 2`. This can lead to incorrect results.

2. In the second `else` branch:
   - The function is checking if `stdout` has any content to determine if the table exists.
   - This approach does not accurately determine table existence because even in the presence of partitions or other info, `stdout` might not be empty. Hence, the function incorrectly returns `True` in this case.

### Bug fix strategy
To fix the bug, we need to adjust how we check for the table's existence in the `stdout` output. Instead of a direct inclusion check, we should utilize a more robust approach that specifically targets the table names only.

### Corrected version of the function

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
    
        # Split the stdout by newlines and check if the exact table name is present
        return stdout and any(t.strip() == table for t in stdout.split('\n'))
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
    
        # Since we are showing partitions, simply check if stdout is not empty
        return bool(stdout)
```

With this correction, the function first splits the `stdout` output by newlines (to handle multiple rows in the output) and then checks if the exact `table` name is present. This ensures a more accurate check for the table's existence.
