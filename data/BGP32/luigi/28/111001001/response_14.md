### Analysis
The buggy function `table_exists` in the `HiveCommandClient` class is supposed to check if a table exists in a given database. The bug seems to be related to the comparison of the table name with the output of the Hive command. In Case 2 and Case 4, we can see that the comparison fails due to case sensitivity issues with table names. The comparison is case-sensitive, which causes the function to return `False` even when the table exists.

### Bug Cause
The bug is caused by the case-sensitive comparison of the table name in the Hive output with the provided table name in the function. This comparison fails when the case of the table names does not match.

### Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to make the comparison case-insensitive. We can achieve this by converting both the table names to lowercase before comparing them.

### Corrected Version
```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
    
        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
    
        return bool(stdout)
``` 

In the corrected version, we convert both the provided table name and the table names from the Hive output to lowercase before comparing them. This ensures a case-insensitive comparison and resolves the bug.
