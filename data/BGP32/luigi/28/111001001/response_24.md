### Bug Analysis:
The buggy function `table_exists` in the `HiveCommandClient` class is checking for the existence of a table in a database with the given table name. The bug occurs when the function tries to determine if the table exists by running a Hive command and checking the output. The issue lies in how the function handles the comparison of the `table` name with the `stdout`.

1. In the first case, the `table` name is 'mytable', and the `stdout` is 'OK'. The function incorrectly checks if the `table` name is in the `stdout` directly, which will always return `True` since 'OK' contains 'mytable'.

2. In the second case, the `table` name is 'MyTable', and the `stdout` is 'OK\nmytable'. Similar to case 1, the function again incorrectly identifies the table existence based on the inclusion of the `table` name in the `stdout`.

### Bug Fix:
To fix the bug, we need to modify how the function checks for the existence of the table in the `stdout`. Instead of just checking for a substring match, we need to ensure that the `table` name is a distinct entity in the `stdout`.

### Corrected Code:
```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table in stdout.split('\n')
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

By splitting the `stdout` on '\n' in the first case of the function, we ensure that the `table` name is a standalone entity and not just a part of a larger string like 'OK'. This modification allows for a more accurate check for the existence of the table in the Hive output.
