### Bug Analysis
The buggy function `table_exists` in the `HiveCommandClient` class is supposed to check if a table exists in a given database. The bug seems to stem from how the function is checking for the existence of the table based on the `stdout` response from the `run_hive_cmd` function.

### Bug Explanation
1. In both cases, the function is checking if the `table` string exists in the `stdout` string returned by the `run_hive_cmd` function. This approach is incorrect because the `stdout` string can contain multiple table names or additional information, causing false positives. For example, in Case 2, the `stdout` contains `OK\nmytable`, which could mistakenly indicate the table exists but it's actually part of another message.

2. The formatting of the `stdout` string in the `run_hive_cmd` function could vary, leading to inconsistency in how tables are represented in the `stdout` string.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug and ensure accurate table existence detection:
1. Modify the `run_hive_cmd` function to return a list of table names instead of a single string.
2. Change the `table_exists` function to properly check if the table name exists in the list of tables returned by `run_hive_cmd` for better accuracy.

### Corrected Version
```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        tables = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
        return tables and table in tables
    else:
        partitions = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
        return any(partition.strip().split('=')[0] == table for partition in partitions)
``` 

In the corrected version, the function now properly checks if the `table` exists in the list of tables returned by `run_hive_cmd`. Additionally, for partitions, it checks if the `table` exists in the partition names returned by `run_hive_cmd`.
