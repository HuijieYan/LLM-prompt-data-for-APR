### Analysis:
- The `table_exists` function is checking whether a table exists in a given Hive database, with an optional partition specification.
- In the first `if` block, the function runs a Hive command to check if the table exists in the database. It then checks if the table name is in the output to determine existence.
- In the second `else` block, the function attempts to show partitions for the given table and partition specification. If there is any output, it assumes the table exists.
- The bug seems to be in the comparison logic used to determine if the table exists based on the output of the Hive commands.
- The conditions for checking the table existence are not handling case sensitivity correctly, as the table name comparisons are case-sensitive.
- The logic for checking the existence based on the presence of a table name in the output may not be accurate.
- The partition specification construction may also have issues.

### Bug:
- The bug is primarily related to the way table existence is checked using the stdout output of the Hive commands. Case sensitivity issues and incorrect comparison logic could lead to inaccurate results.

### Fix:
- To fix the bug, ensure that the table name comparison is case-insensitive by converting both the table names to lowercase before comparison.
- Review the partition specification construction to ensure it is generating the correct specification for the query.
- Refine the logic for checking table existence based on the Hive command output to provide more accurate results.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    table_lower = table.lower()
    
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table_lower))
        tables = stdout.split('\n')
        return table_lower in tables
    else:
        partition_spec_string = ', '.join(['{0}={1}'.format(k, v) for k, v in partition.items()])
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use {0}; show partitions {1} partition ({2})""".format(database, table, partition_spec_string))
        
        return bool(stdout)
```

In the corrected version:
- The table name is converted to lowercase for case-insensitive comparison.
- The retrieved table list is split by newline characters to check for table existence accurately.
- The partition specification construction uses the partition dictionary to create the correct format.
- The return statement simplifies the boolean check for the existence of the table based on the Hive command output.
