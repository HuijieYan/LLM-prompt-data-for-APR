### Bug Explanation
The bug in the `table_exists` function lies in how the conditional statements are checking the existence of a table. 

In Case 1 and Case 3, the bug occurs when checking for the existence of the table in the `stdout`. Here, the function checks if the table is in the `stdout` output, which may not be accurate due to formatting issues.

In Case 2 and Case 4, the bug appears when splitting the `stdout` string to check for the existence of the table. The function is splitting the string based on newline characters. However, if the table name contains uppercase letters, this comparison will fail due to case sensitivity.

### Bug Fix
To fix the bug, we need to standardize the comparison of the table name from the `stdout` output. We can convert both the table name and the `stdout` output to lowercase for a case-insensitive comparison.

Here is the corrected version of the `table_exists` function with the bug fix:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                        (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        return bool(stdout)
``` 

With this fix, we ensure that the table name comparison is done in a case-insensitive manner, thus resolving the bug.
