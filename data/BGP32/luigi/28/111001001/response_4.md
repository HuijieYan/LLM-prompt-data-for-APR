### Analysis
The buggy function `table_exists` in the `HiveCommandClient` class is supposed to check if a table exists in a given database. The function is using the `run_hive_cmd` function from the same file to execute Hive commands.

The bug seems to be related to how the function is checking the existence of the table based on the stdout returned from the Hive commands. The condition `table in stdout` might not be handling the case-sensitive nature of the table names correctly, leading to incorrect results.

### Potential Error
The potential error lies in the comparison of the table names in a case-sensitive manner without considering the case of the table name. This can cause the function to return incorrect results for table existence.

### Bug Explanation
In Case 2 and Case 4, the table names `'mytable'` and `'MyTable'` are evaluated differently based on their casesensitive comparison in the `stdout`. The function uses `table in stdout` to check if the table exists in the list of tables returned by the `show tables` command. However, the case difference between the actual table name and the table name retrieved from `stdout` leads to incorrect results.

### Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we should normalize the comparison of the table names by making them case-insensitive. We can achieve this by converting both the table names and the `stdout` to lowercase before comparison.

### Corrected Version
```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

In the corrected version, both the `table` and `stdout` are converted to lowercase using the `lower()` method before the comparison to ensure a case-insensitive match. This change should address the bug and provide the correct result for checking the existence of the table in the database.
