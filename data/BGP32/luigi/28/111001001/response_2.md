### Analysis:
The buggy function `table_exists` is supposed to check if a given table exists in a specified database. It makes a Hive command to show tables or partitions and then checks if the specified table is present in the output.

### Bug:
The bug in the current implementation lies in the comparison check of the table name in the stdout. The comparison is case-sensitive, which causes issues when comparing table names with different cases. This results in incorrect results being returned by the function.

### Fix:
To fix the bug, we should perform a case-insensitive comparison when checking if the table exists in the output from the Hive command.

### Corrected Version:
```python
import re

def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and any(re.match(table, t, re.IGNORECASE) for t in stdout.split())
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
``` 

In the corrected version, the table names are compared using a case-insensitive regular expression to ensure the correct matching regardless of the case of the characters. This fix addresses the bug and ensures the `table_exists` function behaves as expected.
