### Analysis
The buggy function `table_exists` is meant to check if a table exists in a database with an optional partition specification. The issue seems to be with how the function is checking for the table existence in the Hive database.

#### Bugs:
1. In Case 1 and Case 3, the function is failing to correctly identify the table existence due to case sensitivity, as it doesn't account for the case differences in the table names.
2. In Case 2 and Case 4, the `show tables` or `show partitions` command is returning multiple results, making the function incorrectly identify the table existence.
3. The use of string formatting in the query construction can lead to improper queries being sent to the Hive server.

### Bug Fix Strategy
1. Update the function to perform case-insensitive table existence checks.
2. Handle scenarios where the `show tables` or `show partitions` commands return multiple results.
3. Make sure the constructed queries are formatted properly to avoid syntax errors.

### Corrected Version
```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        command = 'use {0}; show tables;'.format(database)
        stdout = run_hive_cmd(command)
    
        tables = [t.lower() for t in stdout.split('\n')]
        return table.lower() in tables
    else:
        command = 'use {0}; show partitions {1} partition ({2});'.format(database, table, self.partition_spec(partition))
        stdout = run_hive_cmd(command)
    
        return len(stdout.strip()) > 0
``` 

In the corrected version:
- For table existence check without partition, the returned tables are converted to lowercase for case-insensitive comparison.
- In the case of checking with a partition, the existence check is based on the length of the returned partition data.
