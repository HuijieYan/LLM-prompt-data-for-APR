### Analysis
The buggy function `table_exists` is supposed to check if a table exists in a given database and optionally in a specific partition. It uses the `run_hive_cmd` function to execute Hive commands and determine table existence based on the output.

The bug seems to be related to how the `stdout` variable is checked for the existence of the table. The current implementation checks if the `table` string directly exists in `stdout`, which can lead to incorrect results due to partial matches.

### Bug Cause
The bug in the `table_exists` function arises from the way it checks for the existence of a table based on the `stdout` output from the Hive command. The function simply looks for an exact match of the table name within the `stdout` string, which can cause issues with partial matches or case sensitivity.

In the provided cases:
- Cases 1 and 2 pass because the `table` exists in the `stdout` output and matches expected cases.
- Cases 3 and 4 fail due to partial matches (`'mytable'` vs. `'mytable'` or `'MyTable'` vs. `'mytable'`) not being handled correctly.

### Bug Fix
To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the function correctly parses the `stdout` output to detect the presence of the table name. This can be achieved by splitting the `stdout` output into separate lines and then checking for the table name in each line.

Additionally, we should consider case-insensitive comparisons to handle potential differences in case sensitivity.

### Corrected Version
```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        if stdout:
            return any(t.lower() == table.lower() for t in stdout.split())
        else:
            return False
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
``` 

In the corrected version, we split the `stdout` output into individual lines and then perform a case-insensitive check to determine if the table name exists within those lines. This should handle cases where the table name appears as part of a larger string and ensure more accurate detection of table existence.
