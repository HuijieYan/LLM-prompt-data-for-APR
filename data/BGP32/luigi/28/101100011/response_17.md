### Analysis:
1. The `table_exists` function in the `HiveCommandClient` class checks for the table's existence by running a Hive command and then comparing the output of the command with the table name.
2. The failing test `test_table_exists` defines mock responses for the `run_hive_cmd`, and it expects the function to handle case insensitivity when checking for table existence.
3. The issue on GitHub highlights the need for the `table_exists` function to be case insensitive because Hive is case insensitive when it comes to table names.
4. The bug in the current implementation is that it directly compares the table name with the output of the Hive command without considering case sensitivity.

### Bug Cause:
The bug in the `table_exists` function is due to the direct comparison of the table name with the output of the Hive command without considering case sensitivity. Table names in Hive are case insensitive, so the function should convert both the table name and the output to lowercase for comparison.

### Bug Fix:
To fix the bug, we need to modify the `table_exists` function to convert both the table name and the output of the Hive command to lowercase for case-insensitive comparison.

### Corrected Version:
```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    
    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        table_lower = table.lower()  # Convert table name to lowercase
        
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
            return stdout and table_lower in stdout.lower()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                                (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
            return stdout.lower() is not None
        
        return False
```

### Summary:
The corrected version of the `table_exists` function now converts both the table name and the output of the Hive command to lowercase for a case-insensitive comparison. This change addresses the bug reported in the failing test and aligns with the suggested solution in the GitHub issue.
