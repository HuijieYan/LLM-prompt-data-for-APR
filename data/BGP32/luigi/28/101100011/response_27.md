## Correction:

### Cause of the Bug:
The bug in the `table_exists` function arises from the case sensitivity issue when checking if a table exists in Hive. The function does not consider the case of the table name when comparing it to the output from the Hive command, leading to test failures when the table names have different case variations.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix this bug, we need to modify the comparison in the `table_exists` function to be case insensitive. By converting both the table name and the output from the Hive command to lowercase before comparing them, we can ensure that the function works correctly regardless of the case of the table names.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                        (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

By converting both the table name and the output to lowercase before comparing them, we ensure that the function is case insensitive and correctly identifies if the table exists in the Hive database.

This correction should address the issue reported in the GitHub bug report and ensure that the `table_exists` function works as expected in all cases, passing the failing test provided.
