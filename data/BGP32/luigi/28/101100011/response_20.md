Based on the analysis of the buggy function, related functions, failing test, and GitHub issue, the bug in the `table_exists` function is that it does not handle case sensitivity correctly when checking if a table exists in Hive. The function compares the table name directly without considering the case differences. This leads to failing tests when trying to assert the existence of a table using different case variations.

To fix this bug, we need to update the `table_exists` function to be case insensitive when comparing the table names. We can convert both the table name and the stdout to lowercase before comparison to ensure a consistent approach to handling case sensitivity.

Here is the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
    
        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                        (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
    
        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

With these changes, the `table_exists` function now correctly handles case sensitivity by converting both the table name and the stdout to lowercase before comparison. This will ensure that the function passes the failing test cases and resolves the issues reported on GitHub related to case sensitivity in table existence checks.
