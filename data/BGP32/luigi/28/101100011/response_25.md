### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `table_exists` is checking for the existence of a table in Hive based on the output from `run_hive_cmd` function.
2. The bug arises when matching the table name in a case-insensitive manner. Hive is case-insensitive, so the table name in stdout might not match with the provided table name.
3. The failing test case exemplifies this issue by expecting a case-insensitive comparison.
4. The suggested fix is to modify the buggy function to compare the lowercase version of the provided table name with the lowercase version of the stdout to avoid case sensitivity issues.

### Corrected Version:
```python
# The corrected version of the buggy function
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                        (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

In this corrected version, both the provided table name and the stdout are converted to lowercase before comparison. This ensures a case-insensitive check, addressing the bug mentioned in the GitHub issue.

Now, the `table_exists` function will pass the failing test cases and provide the expected behavior in a case-insensitive manner.
