### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `table_exists` is responsible for checking if a table exists in a Hive database. It uses the `run_hive_cmd` function to execute Hive commands.
2. The bug causes failures in the test cases because the function does not handle case insensitivity. The test cases are designed to test the behavior of the function with different case scenarios.
3. Based on the GitHub issue, it is clear that the function needs to be case insensitive when checking the existence of tables in Hive. The current implementation does not consider case sensitivity, leading to test failures.
4. To fix the bug, we need to modify the comparison between the table name and the stdout to consider case insensitivity.
5. Below is the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

### Corrected Version:
```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

By making the comparison case insensitive by converting both the table name and stdout to lowercase, the corrected version of the function ensures that the test cases will pass successfully, resolving the issue reported on GitHub.
