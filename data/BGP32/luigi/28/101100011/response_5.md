### Analysis:
The buggy function `table_exists` in the `HiveCommandClient` class is failing to handle case insensitivity when checking for the existence of a table in Hive. The function uses the `run_hive_cmd` function to run the Hive commands and check the output against the provided table name. The failing test checks for table existence with different cases, and the function fails to handle these cases correctly.

### Error Locations:
1. The comparison `table in stdout` in the first branch of the `if` statement does not consider case insensitivity.
2. The second branch also doesn't consider case insensitivity when comparing the output of `run_hive_cmd` using `stdout`.

### Cause of the Bug:
The bug is caused by the function not handling case insensitivity when checking for table existence. The failing test in the provided GitHub issue highlights the problem where the table name is returned in lowercase in the Hive output but is provided in a different case in the function call.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to convert both the table name and the stdout to lowercase when comparing them for table existence. This way, we ensure case insensitivity during the comparison.

### Corrected Version:
```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    
    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
    
            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
        
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition (%s)""" % 
                                  (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
    
            if stdout:
                return True
            else:
                return False
```

### Conclusion:
By modifying the `table_exists` function to convert both the provided table name and the Hive output to lowercase during comparison, the bug related to case insensitivity when checking for table existence should be resolved. The corrected version ensures that the function behaves correctly with case differences in table names during table existence checks.
