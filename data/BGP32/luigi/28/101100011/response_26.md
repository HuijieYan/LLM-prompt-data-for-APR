### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `table_exists` is trying to determine if a table exists in the specified database by running a Hive command and checking the output against the provided table name.
2. The failing test indicates that the function is case sensitive, causing it to fail when comparing table names that differ in case.
3. The GitHub issue highlights the need to make the `table_exists` function case insensitive to address this problem.
4. The bug occurs due to the direct comparison of table names without considering case sensitivity.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to modify the `table_exists` function to convert both the table name and the output from Hive to lowercase before comparing them. This will make the comparison case insensitive, resolving the failing test case.

### Corrected Version:
```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
    
            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                                (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
    
            if stdout:
                return True
            else:
                return False
```

By converting both the input table name and the output from Hive to lowercase before comparing them, the `table_exists` function will now be case insensitive and pass the failing test case.
