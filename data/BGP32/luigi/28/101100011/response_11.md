### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `table_exists` in the `HiveCommandClient` class checks if a table exists in a database by running a Hive command and checking the output.
2. The buggy function uses the `run_hive_cmd` function to run Hive queries.
3. The failing test `test_table_exists` in `hive_test.py` mocks the `run_hive_cmd` function to provide different stdout values for testing.
4. The GitHub issues indicate that the problem lies in case sensitivity when checking for table existence.
5. The buggy function does not handle case sensitivity when comparing the table name with the output from Hive.

### Error Location:
The bug is likely in the comparison of the table name with the output from Hive in the `table_exists` function.

### Cause of the Bug:
The bug is caused by the buggy function not considering case sensitivity when comparing the provided table name with the output of Hive queries. This leads to inconsistencies, especially when dealing with different case variations of table names.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the comparison of the table name with the Hive output is case insensitive. One approach is to convert both the table name and the Hive output to lowercase before comparison to ensure consistency.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
Here is the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

By converting both the table name and the Hive output to lowercase before comparison, we ensure that the check for table existence is case insensitive and resolves the issue reported in the GitHub discussion.
