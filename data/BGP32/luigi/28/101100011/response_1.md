## Analysis:
1. The buggy function `table_exists` in the `HiveCommandClient` class is expected to check if a table exists in the specified database. The issue reported on GitHub highlights the need for case insensitivity in checking table existence.
2. The bug is likely in the comparison logic of the returned `stdout` with the table name.
3. The bug occurs when the table name casing doesn't match the casing in the returned `stdout`. The existing logic doesn't consider case differences, leading to test failures.
4. To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the comparison between the table name and the `stdout` is case insensitive. Converting both strings to lowercase before comparison can help achieve this.
5. We should modify the `table_exists` function to convert both `table` and `stdout` to lowercase before comparing.

## Corrected Version:
```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
    
            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                                (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
    
            if stdout:
                return True
            else:
                return False
```

By converting both `table` and `stdout` to lowercase before comparison, the corrected version of the `table_exists` function ensures case insensitivity when checking for table existence. This modification should resolve the bug reported in the GitHub issue and make the function more robust.
