### Analysis:
1. The `table_exists` function in the `HiveCommandClient` class is supposed to check if a given table exists in the specified database and partition.
2. The bug lies in the comparison logic where it does not consider case insensitivity when checking if the table exists.
3. The failing test case specifically tests the behavior in case-insensitive comparisons, which is related to the GitHub issues #896 and #898.
4. To fix the bug, we need to modify the comparison logic to account for case insensitivity.
5. We should modify the return statements to check if the lowercase version of the table name is present in the lowercase version of the output from the Hive command.

### Correction:
```python
# The corrected version of the buggy function
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

By modifying the comparison logic to check the lowercase versions, we ensure that case insensitivity is taken into account when verifying the existence of a table in Hive. This corrected version should now pass the failing test cases and address the issue reported in GitHub.
