Based on the provided information, the bug in the `table_exists` function is related to case sensitivity when checking for the existence of a table in Hive. The function does not take into account case differences between the provided table name and the table names returned from Hive.

To fix this bug:
1. Modify the condition where the table name is checked in the stdout to be case insensitive.
2. Convert both the table name and the stdout to lowercase for comparison.

Here is the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
# The corrected version of the buggy function
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                        (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

By making the table name comparison case insensitive, the corrected function will now correctly check for the existence of tables in Hive, regardless of the case of their names. This fix should resolve the issue reported on GitHub and also make the test cases pass successfully.
