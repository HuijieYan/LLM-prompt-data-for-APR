### Analysis:
1. The `table_exists` function has a bug where it does not handle case sensitivity correctly when comparing the table names.
2. The test case `test_table_exists` in `hive_test.py` fails due to the incorrect handling of case sensitivity in the `table_exists` function.
3. The GitHub issue highlights the problem and suggests a solution to make the `table_exists` function case insensitive.
4. The fix involves converting the table name to lowercase before comparing it with the output from `run_hive_cmd`.

### Bug Cause:
The bug in the `table_exists` function occurs because it directly compares the provided table name with the output from `run_hive_cmd`, which may not match in case. This leads to false negatives in the test cases, causing the tests to fail.

### Proposed Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to convert both the table name and the output of `run_hive_cmd` to lowercase before the comparison. This will ensure that the comparison is case insensitive and accurate.

### Corrected Version:
```python
# Corrected version of the table_exists function
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

By making this change, the `table_exists` function will now correctly handle case sensitivity issues and pass the failing test cases.

### Note:
Make sure to update all relevant code references to the correct and consistent naming convention based on this fix.
