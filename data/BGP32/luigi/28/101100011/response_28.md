### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `table_exists` in the `HiveCommandClient` class is responsible for checking if a table exists in a Hive database. The issue arises when the table names have different cases between what is passed and what is returned by Hive causing test failures.
2. The bug mainly lies in the comparison logic between the provided table name and the table names returned by Hive queries.
3. The bug originates from not accounting for case-insensitivity when comparing table names. As indicated in the GitHub issue, Hive is case-insensitive and returns table names in lowercase. Therefore, the comparison should be case-insensitive to prevent test failures.
4. To fix the bug, the comparison between the provided table name and the table names returned by Hive should be done in a case-insensitive manner.

### Correction:
```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
        
            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
        else:
            partition_cmd = self.partition_spec(partition)
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition (%s)""" % (database, table, partition_cmd))
    
            return bool(stdout)

```

By converting both the provided table name and the table names returned by Hive to lowercase before comparison, we ensure that the check is case-insensitive. This corrected version of the function should address the bug and pass the failing test case.
