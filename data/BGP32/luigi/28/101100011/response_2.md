### Corrections and Explanations:

#### Bug Location:
The bug is located in the `table_exists` function in the `HiveCommandClient` class of the `luigi.contrib.hive.py` file. The bug arises due to a case sensitivity issue when comparing the table name against the output obtained from the `run_hive_cmd` function.

#### Cause of the Bug:
The bug is causing the test case to fail because the comparison between the table name and the `stdout` obtained from `run_hive_cmd` is case sensitive. The output from Hive is always in lowercase, leading to a mismatch between the table names causing the test to fail. The GitHub issue has been raised to address this problem and suggests making the comparison case insensitive.

#### Strategy to Fix the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to modify the comparison logic in the `table_exists` function to make it case insensitive when checking if the table exists in the `stdout` output obtained from Hive. By converting both the table name and the `stdout` output to lowercase, we can ensure a proper comparison irrespective of the case.

#### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                                (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

            return bool(stdout)
```

The corrected version of the `table_exists` function now converts both the table name and the `stdout` output to lowercase for a case-insensitive comparison. This change resolves the bug and ensures that the function behaves correctly according to the GitHub issue raised.

By implementing this fix, the `table_exists` function should now pass the failing test cases provided.
