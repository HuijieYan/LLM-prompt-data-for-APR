### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `table_exists` in the `HiveCommandClient` class is using a case-sensitive comparison to check if a table exists in Hive.
2. The failing test case `test_table_exists` in the `hive_test.py` file checks for case sensitivity issues and expects case-insensitive behavior.
3. The GitHub issue #896 and its description confirm that the desired behavior is to make the `table_exists` method case insensitive to match Hive's behavior.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is caused by the `table_exists` function not performing a case-insensitive comparison when checking table existence in Hive. This leads to failing test cases when table names have different cases.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, the `table_exists` function needs to compare the table name in a case-insensitive manner by converting both the table name and the stdout to lowercase before comparison.

### Corrected Version:
```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    
    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
    
            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                                (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
    
            if stdout:
                return True
            else:
                return False
```

By converting both `table` and `stdout` to lowercase before comparison, the corrected version of the function now performs a case-insensitive check for table existence in Hive.

This corrected version should pass the failing test cases and align with the desired behavior specified in the GitHub issue.
