## Analysis:
1. The buggy function `table_exists` checks for the existence of a table in Hive, but it does not handle case sensitivity properly. The function does not consider case differences between the table name provided and the table names retrieved from the Hive commands.
2. The failing test `test_table_exists` in `hive_test.py` highlights the issue by testing table existence with different letter case variations.
3. The GitHub issue (#896) and its detailed description suggest that the function should be case insensitive when checking for table existence to prevent failures due to case mismatch.
4. To fix the bug, we need to modify the `table_exists` function to compare table names in a case-insensitive manner.

## Bug Cause:
The bug occurs because the `table_exists` function does not address case sensitivity when comparing the table names retrieved from Hive commands with the table name provided as input.

## Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, the function `table_exists` should convert both the provided table name and the names retrieved from Hive commands to lower case for a case-insensitive comparison. This approach aligns with the suggestions in the GitHub issue.

## Corrected Buggy Function:
```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
``` 

In the corrected version, both the `table` and `stdout` are converted to lower case before comparison to make the function case insensitive.

By making this change, the `table_exists` function will now be able to handle table name checks without worrying about case differences. This solution aligns with the desired behavior highlighted in the GitHub issue, making the function more robust and preventing failures due to case mismatch.
