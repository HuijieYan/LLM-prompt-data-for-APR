### Analysis:
The buggy function `table_exists` in the `HiveCommandClient` class of `luigi/contrib/hive.py` is not implementing a case-insensitive comparison when checking for table existence in the `stdout` data returned from the `run_hive_cmd` function. This leads to failing tests, especially when the table names are in different cases. The failing test case `test_table_exists` in `test/contrib/hive_test.py` demonstrates this issue.

### Potential Error Locations:
1. In the `if partition is None` block, the comparison is not case-insensitive.
2. In the `else` block, the comparison between `stdout` and `True` is not properly handling case-insensitivity.

### Bug Cause:
The bug occurs because the `table_exists` function directly compares the `table` name with the `stdout` data without considering case sensitivity. This causes the test cases to fail when the case of the table names in the `stdout` data doesn't match the provided `table` name.

### Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the comparison between the `table` name and the `stdout` data is case-insensitive. By converting both to lowercase before comparison, we can handle the issue of different casing in the names.

### Corrected Version:
```python
# The corrected version of the buggy function
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
    
        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
    
        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
``` 

By converting both the `table` and `stdout` data to lowercase before comparison, we ensure a case-insensitive check for table existence in the `stdout`. This corrected version should pass the failing test case provided, resolve the issue reported on GitHub, and make the `table_exists` function case insensitive.
