### Analyzing the Buggy Function:

1. The `table_exists` function in the `HiveCommandClient` class checks if a table exists in a specified database with an optional partition.
2. The function calls `run_hive_cmd` function to execute Hive commands and retrieve the output.
3. The bug arises when checking the existence of a table without considering case sensitivity.

### Identifying Potential Error Locations:
- The comparison of `table in stdout` where `table` is not converted to lowercase.
- The comparison of the partition specification result with the output without ensuring case insensitivity.

### Cause of the Bug:
The bug arises due to the case sensitivity issue when comparing the table names retrieved from Hive with the provided table name. Hive returns table names in lowercase, causing the comparisons to fail.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to:
1. Convert both the provided table name and the names retrieved from Hive to lowercase for case-insensitive comparisons.
2. Modify the comparison criteria to account for case insensitivity.
3. Implement the suggestions mentioned in the GitHub issue for handling case-insensitive comparisons.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
# Fixing the buggy function for case-insensitive table existence check

class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    
    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
    
            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
        else:
            partition_spec = self.partition_spec(partition)
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("use {}; show partitions {} partition ({});".format(database, table, partition_spec))
    
            return bool(stdout)

```

By converting both the table names to lowercase before comparisons and updating the comparison criteria in the `table_exists` function, we resolve the case sensitivity issue as discussed in the GitHub issue. The corrected version ensures that the function correctly checks for the existence of a table in Hive without being affected by case differences.
