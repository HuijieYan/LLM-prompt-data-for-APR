After analyzing the buggy function and the failing test provided, it seems that the issue lies in the case sensitivity of the table names when checking for their existence in the Hive database. The function `table_exists` compares the table name against the output of the Hive command, which might return table names in lowercase, leading to failures in case-sensitive checks.

To fix this bug, we need to make the comparison case-insensitive. This can be achieved by converting both the table name and the output from the Hive command to lowercase before comparing them.

Here is the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: luigi/contrib/hive.py

# This function from the same file, but not the same class, is called by the buggy function
def run_hive_cmd(hivecmd, check_return_code=True):
    # Please ignore the body of this function

# The declaration of the class containing the buggy function
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    # This function from the same class is called by the buggy function
    def partition_spec(self, partition):
        # Please ignore the body of this function

    # Corrected version of the buggy function
    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
    
            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                                (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
    
            return bool(stdout)
```

With this corrected version, the `table_exists` function will perform a case-insensitive check when comparing the table name against the output from the Hive command, resolving the case sensitivity issue reported in the GitHub issue.

Now the function should pass the failing test provided, addressing the problem described in the GitHub issue.
