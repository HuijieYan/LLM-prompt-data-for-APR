### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `table_exists` in the `HiveCommandClient` class from the file `luigi/contrib/hive.py` is not handling case insensitivity properly when checking for table existence.
2. The failing test function `test_table_exists` in the file `test/contrib/hive_test.py` is testing for case insensitivity issues and the buggy behavior.
3. The GitHub issue highlights the need to make the `table_exists` function case insensitive to address the problem reported.

### Bug Cause:
The bug in the `table_exists` function arises from not handling case insensitivity when comparing the table name with the output received from Hive. The function should convert both names to lower case for a case insensitive comparison.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to modify the `table_exists` function to convert both the table name and the Hive output to lower case before comparing them. This will ensure a case insensitive check for table existence.

### Corrected Version:
```python
# Fixing the buggy function to make it case insensitive
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

After applying this fix by converting both the table name and the Hive output to lower case, the `table_exists` function should now pass the failing test cases and address the issue reported on GitHub.
