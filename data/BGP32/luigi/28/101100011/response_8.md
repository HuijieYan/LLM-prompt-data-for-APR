Based on the analysis of the provided code, test code, and GitHub issues, it is clear that the bug in the `table_exists` function is due to case sensitivity when checking for table existence in Hive. The function does not consider case insensitivity, leading to incorrect results in some cases.

To fix this bug:
1. Modify the comparison to be case insensitive by converting both `table` and `stdout` to lowercase before checking for table existence.

Here is the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
# The corrected version of the buggy function
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

By converting both the `table` and the `stdout` to lowercase before comparison, this corrected version ensures that the table existence check is case insensitive, resolving the bug reported in the GitHub issue.

This corrected version of the function should pass the failing test and address the case sensitivity issue described in the GitHub issue.
