## Analysis:
1. The buggy function `table_exists` checks for the existence of a table in a database in a case-sensitive manner.
2. The test function provided demonstrates that the function fails when the table name is in a different case than expected due to case sensitivity.
3. The GitHub issue highlights the need to make `table_exists` case insensitive to avoid issues with table names in different cases.
4. The bug is caused by not converting the table name to lowercase before checking for its existence in the stdout.
5. The strategy for fixing the bug would be to convert both the table name and the stdout to lowercase for comparison.

## Correction:
```python
# Updated and corrected version of the buggy function
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

After making the table name and stdout lowercase for comparison, the corrected version of the function should now pass the failing test and resolve the issue reported on GitHub.
