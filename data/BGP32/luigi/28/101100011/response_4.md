## Analysis
The buggy function `table_exists()` in the `HiveCommandClient` class of `luigi/contrib/hive.py` is failing the test case `test_table_exists()` in `test/contrib/hive_test.py`. The issue originates from the comparison of the table name in a case-sensitive manner. The GitHub issue titled "hive table_exists should be case insensitive?" addresses this problem and suggests a solution to make the comparison case insensitive.

## Error Locations
1. Comparing the table name directly without converting to lowercase.
2. Incorrectly handling case sensitivity in table existence check.

## Cause of the Bug
The buggy function `table_exists()` checks for the presence of a table in Hive by comparing the table name directly without converting it to lowercase. Hive is case-insensitive, leading to failed comparisons when the table names have different cases. This results in false negatives for table existence checks.

## Strategy for Fixing the Bug
To fix this bug, we need to modify the `table_exists()` function to convert the table name to lowercase before comparing it with the output from Hive. By making the comparison case-insensitive, we can ensure that the function correctly identifies whether a table exists in Hive regardless of the case used in the table name.

## Corrected Version
```python
# The corrected version of the buggy function

class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table.lower()))

            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table.lower(), self.partition_spec(partition)))

            if stdout:
                return True
            else:
                return False
```

By converting both the `table` and `stdout` to lowercase before comparison, the `table_exists()` function now handles the case sensitivity issue correctly. This corrected version should pass the failing test case and resolve the issue raised on GitHub related to case-insensitive table existence checks in Hive.
