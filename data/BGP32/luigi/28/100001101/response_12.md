The bug in the provided function stems from the condition checks for the presence of the table in the output of the Hive command. The buggy function only checks if the `stdout` variable is not empty to determine if the table exists, leading to incorrect outputs.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the function to accurately parse the stdout output of the Hive commands and check for the presence of the table name in the output. We should also consider case sensitivity for table names.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
        return stdout.strip().lower() == table.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use {0}; show partitions {1} partition
                        ({2})""".format(database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        return bool(stdout.strip())  # checking if stdout is not empty

```

This corrected version of the function ensures that the output of the Hive command is stripped of extra spaces and converted to lowercase for proper comparison. Additionally, the function now checks if the `stdout` output is not empty for the partitioned case.

By implementing these changes, the function now accurately determines whether a table exists in the specified database and partition.
