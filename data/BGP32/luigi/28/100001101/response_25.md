### Analysis
The buggy function `table_exists` is supposed to check if a table exists in a specified database. It first checks using a SQL-like query when `partition` is None, and then it checks using `show partitions` when `partition` is specified. The bug seems to be in the comparison of the `table` in the output received.

### Bug
The bug lies in the comparison of the `table` name with the fetched output from the Hive commands. In Case 2, the table names are mismatched due to case sensitivity, leading to incorrect output. Additionally, the table check based on stdout content does not account for potential whitespace or newlines, leading to incorrect results in other cases.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug
To fix the bug, normalize the table names for comparison to handle case sensitivity. Trim any leading or trailing spaces and newline characters from stdout before comparison. This will ensure correct evaluation of table existence.

### Corrected Version
```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
        
        normalized_tables = map(str.strip, stdout.split('\n'))
        return table in normalized_tables
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
        
        return bool(stdout)
```
