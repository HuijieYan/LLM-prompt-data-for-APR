The buggy function is intended to check if a table exists in a Hive database. It has two branches, one for when a partition is specified and one for when it is not.

The bug seems to be related to the condition checking the existence of the table. In the first branch, the function checks if the table name is in the output of the Hive command, but it doesn't handle cases where the table name might be partially contained within another table name.

To fix this bug, a more precise check should be implemented. We can split the stdout by newlines and then check if the table name matches exactly one of the lines.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables;'.format(database))
        table_exists = False
        for line in stdout.split('\n'):
            if table == line.strip():
                table_exists = True
                break
        return table_exists
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                        (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

This corrected version checks if the table exists by looping through each line of the stdout and comparing it to the provided table name exactly. This ensures that only the exact matching table is considered to exist.
