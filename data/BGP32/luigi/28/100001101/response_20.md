The bug in the provided function `table_exists` is in the condition where it checks if stdout is not empty to determine if a table exists. However, in Case 2, the table name in `stdout` is `"mytable"`, while the input table name is `"MyTable"`. The function is case-sensitive in comparing the table name, causing it to incorrectly return False.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the comparison to be case-insensitive. We can achieve this by converting both the table names to lowercase before comparing them. 

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

This version will ensure that table names are compared in a case-insensitive manner, addressing the bug described.
