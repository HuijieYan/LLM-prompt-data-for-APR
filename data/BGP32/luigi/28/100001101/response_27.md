### Bug Explanation
The bug is in the `table_exists` function where the condition to check if a table exists in Hive is incorrect. The function checks if the `stdout` variable is not empty to determine if the table exists, which is incorrect. In Case 2 and Case 5, the function incorrectly detects the table as existing when it should not.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to modify the conditions to accurately check for the existence of the table in Hive based on the `stdout` output. Checking if the table name is present in the `stdout` will not suffice. We should update the logic to properly handle the `stdout` output from the Hive commands.

### Corrected Version

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table in stdout.split()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        return stdout  # Assuming Hive returns partitions if they exist
``` 

In the corrected version, we split the `stdout` by lines to properly check if the table is in the output. The function now returns based on whether the table exists in the Hive database or whether the partitions exist based on the given conditions.
