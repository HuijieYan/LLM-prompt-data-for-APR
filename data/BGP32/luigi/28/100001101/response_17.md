### Cause of the bug:
The bug in the `table_exists` function arises from the condition checking in the return statements. In the first case when `partition` is None, the function checks if the table exists based on the condition `stdout and table in stdout`. If `stdout` is not empty and the `table` is in `stdout`, it returns `True`. However, in this case, the function is incorrectly checking for exact matches between the table and the entries in `stdout`, leading to potential mismatches due to formatting or case sensitivity.

In the second case when `partition` is not None, the function executes a similar check, but with the partition information. The problem persists as it only checks for the presence of `stdout` but doesn't validate the contents properly.

### Bug-fix strategy:
To address the bug, we need to modify the logic of the function to handle the table existence check more accurately. Instead of relying solely on string comparison for exact matches, a more robust approach would be to parse the output to verify the presence of the specific table or partition.

### Corrected version of the function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
        table_list = stdout.split()
        return table in table_list
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
        partitions = [p.split('=')[1] for p in stdout.split()]
        return partition.values() == partitions
```

In the corrected version, the function splits the `stdout` output and performs checks based on the list of tables or partitions retrieved. This ensures a more reliable verification process for the existence of the table or partition.
