### Analyzing the buggy function
The function `table_exists` is designed to check if a table or a partition exists in a Hive database. It takes parameters `table`, `database`, and `partition`. In the given cases, the function is not returning the expected results based on the input values and the variables at the return.

### Error location
The bug seems to be occurring in the condition check for the existence of a table or a partition. The function uses the output from running a Hive command to determine existence, but the logic seems to be incorrect.

### Cause of the bug
1. In cases 1 and 2, when the table is found in the stdout, the function is not returning `True` as expected.
2. In cases 3 and 6, when checking for a specific partition, the function is not checking the `stdout` to determine existence correctly.
3. The logic for checking table or partition existence based on the output of the Hive command is flawed.

### Suggested strategy for fixing the bug
To fix the bug, we need to make sure that the function correctly determines the existence of a table or a partition based on the stdout received from the Hive commands. We should adjust the condition checks accordingly.

### Corrected version of the function
```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
        return table in stdout
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use {0}; show partitions {1} partition ({2})""".format(database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
        return bool(stdout)
``` 

By modifying the condition check to directly return the presence of the element in the `stdout` output, we can accurately determine if the table or partition exists in the Hive database.
