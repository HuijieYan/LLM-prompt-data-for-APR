The bug in the provided function is that the check for the table existence is incorrect. The function is checking if the table name is in the output of the `show tables` command, which may result in false positives when the table name is part of another table's name or when there are multiple tables listed in the output.

To fix the bug, we should modify the function to check if the exact table name exists in the output of the `show tables` command. This can be achieved by splitting the output and checking for an exact match.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables;'.format(database))
        return any(t == table for t in stdout.split())
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

This corrected version will iterate over each table name in the output of `show tables` and check for an exact match with the provided table name, ensuring accurate table existence verification.
