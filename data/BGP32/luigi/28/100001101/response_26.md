The bug in the function `table_exists` arises from the incorrect comparison made in the `if` conditions. The function assumes that if `stdout` is returned from the command execution (indicating successful execution), then the table exists. However, in some cases, the `stdout` might still be returned even if the table does not exist, leading to incorrect results.

To fix this bug, a more robust check is needed to verify the actual presence of the table in Hive. One approach could be to check if the table name is present in the list of tables retrieved from Hive.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables;'.format(database))

        return stdout and table in stdout.split('\n')
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        return 'OK' in stdout  # Assuming 'OK' indicates the table exists

```

This corrected version takes a more reliable approach by checking if the table exists in the list of tables obtained from Hive. This way, false positives due to generic commands returning `stdout` are minimized.
