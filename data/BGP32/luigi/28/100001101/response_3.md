Upon analyzing the provided buggy function and the runtime input/output values alongside the expected input/output values, we can identify the following issues:

1. In the `table_exists` function, the `stdout` variable is being checked for truthiness directly with the `and` operator, which might lead to unexpected behavior.
2. The comparison of the table name with the output is case-sensitive, which can cause discrepancies in the results.

To fix these issues, we can modify the function to handle the `stdout` variable more robustly and also ensure case-insensitive comparison of the table names.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
        
        return stdout is not None and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                        (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
        
        return stdout is not None
```

This corrected version uses `is not None` instead of just checking for truthiness. It also converts both the table name and the output to lowercase for a case-insensitive comparison. These changes should ensure the function behaves as expected in all the provided test cases.
