### Analyzing the buggy function
The function `table_exists` checks if a given `table` exists in a specific `database`. If a `partition` is provided, it also checks for partitions. However, based on the runtime values and expected values given, the function is not correctly handling the cases where partitions are involved.

### Identifying the bug
The bug seems to be in the handling of partitions. When a partition is involved, the function is not correctly parsing the command or processing the output to determine if the table exists.

### Cause of the bug
In cases where partitions are involved, the function is not constructing the correct command to check for partitions, leading to incorrect results in determining if the table exists or not.

### Strategy for fixing the bug
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the function correctly constructs the command to check for partitions when they are involved. The parsing of the output should also be adjusted to handle partition-specific information.

### Corrected version of the function
```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
        return stdout and table in stdout
    else:
        partitions = self.partition_spec(partition)
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use {0}; show partition {1} {2}""".format(database, table, partitions))
        return bool(stdout)
``` 

In the corrected version of the function, the command to check for partitions is constructed correctly, and the output parsing is adjusted to handle partition-specific information. This should address the bug and ensure the function works as expected in all cases provided.
