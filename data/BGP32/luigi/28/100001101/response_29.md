### Problem Analysis
The buggy function `table_exists` is meant to check if a table exists in a database within a Hive system. However, there are issues with the condition checks and the structure of the SQL queries being executed based on the provided input values.

1. The first condition check in the function does not appear to handle cases where the table name might differ in case sensitivity. The function should be case-insensitive when matching table names.
2. The second condition check within the `else` block is missing the actual condition to check if the table exists. Therefore, it always returns `True`.
3. The structure of the SQL queries seems incorrect, especially when it comes to handling partitions. The queries should be properly formatted to meet Hive syntax rules.

### Bug Fix Strategy
1. Modify the function to perform a case-insensitive check for table existence.
2. Correct the condition check within the `else` block to verify if the table exists.
3. Correct the structure of the SQL queries to comply with Hive syntax standards.

### Corrected Version of the Function
```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    table = table.lower()  # Convert table name to lowercase for case-insensitive comparison

    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table in stdout.lower()  # Perform case-insensitive check
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        # Check if any partitions are returned in stdout to confirm table existence
        return stdout.strip() != ""  # Check for table existence based on partitions
```

This corrected version of the function should address the identified issues and properly check for table existence in the Hive system.
