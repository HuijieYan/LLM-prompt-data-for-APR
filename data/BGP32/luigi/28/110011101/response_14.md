### Analysis
The buggy function `table_exists` in the `HiveCommandClient` class is failing the test cases due to incorrect logic in comparing the output of the `run_hive_cmd` function. The function is currently returning based on whether the `stdout` variable has a truthy value, which may not always be the correct approach for checking table existence.

### Bug Explanation
1. In the first failing test case, the `stdout` value is 'OK' but the expected table name is 'mytable'. Since 'mytable' is not found in 'OK', the function should return `False`. However, the buggy function doesn't handle this correctly.
   
2. In the second failing test case, the `stdout` value is 'OK\nmytable'. The function should recognize that 'mytable' exists in the output and return `True`. Again, the current implementation doesn't handle this properly for case-insensitive checking.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the function correctly parses the output `stdout` to check if the table exists using a case-insensitive approach. We should consider splitting the `stdout` by newline characters and then compare the table names in a case-insensitive way.

### Corrected Version
```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
            tables = stdout.split('\n')
            return any(t.lower() == table.lower() for t in tables)
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
            partitions = stdout.split('\n')
            return any(p.lower() == self.partition_spec(partition).lower() for p in partitions)
```

By splitting the output from `run_hive_cmd` and checking each table or partition for a case-insensitive match to the desired table name, we ensure that the function correctly determines the existence of the table or partition. This corrected version should pass the failing tests and accurately check for table existence.
