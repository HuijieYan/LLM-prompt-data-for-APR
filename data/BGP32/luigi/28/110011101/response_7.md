## Bug Explanation
The bug in the `table_exists` function arises from the expected behavior when checking if the table exists. The function currently checks for the presence of the table name as a whole in the stdout output, which can lead to incorrect results. It should instead check if the table name is a separate entity in the stdout. 

## Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, the function should parse the `stdout` output into separate lines and then check if the table name exists as a standalone entry in those lines. This approach will prevent issues like false positives when the table name is included in a longer string.

## The Corrected Version of the Function
Below is the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
            return stdout and table in stdout.split('\n')
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
            return any(table == line.strip() for line in stdout.split('\n'))
```

By splitting the `stdout` by newline characters and then checking if the table exists in separate lines, the corrected function should now pass the failing tests and correctly determine if a table exists in the Hive database.
