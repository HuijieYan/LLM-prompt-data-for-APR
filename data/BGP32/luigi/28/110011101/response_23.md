### Analysis
1. The buggy function `table_exists` is supposed to check if a given table exists in the provided database with an optional partition. It uses the `run_hive_cmd` function to run Hive queries.
2. The bug seems to be related to how the function checks if the table exists by looking for the table name in the output of the Hive command.
3. The bug causes the function to incorrectly return `True` even when the table does not exist.
4. The bug can be fixed by properly parsing the output of the Hive command and checking if the table name is present in it.

### Bug Fix
```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
    
            return stdout and table in stdout
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                                (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
    
            return table in stdout.split()
```

By splitting the output of the Hive command by newline characters and then checking if the table name is present in that list, we ensure that the function correctly determines if the table exists. Fixing this logic should resolve the failing tests.
