### Bug Fix Strategy
The bug in the `table_exists` function seems to be related to the condition checking of the `stdout` variable. The function checks if `stdout` is non-empty to determine the existence of the table, which might be leading to incorrect results.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the condition statements to properly check if the table exists based on the output from the `run_hive_cmd` function. We should also consider case sensitivity when checking for table existence.

### Corrected Version of the Function
```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: luigi/contrib/hive.py

# The corrected version of the class containing the buggy function
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables in {1};'.format(database, table))
            return table.lower() in [t.lower() for t in stdout.split()]
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use {0}; show partitions {1} partition
                                ({2})""".format(database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
            return bool(stdout)
```

By modifying the condition for checking table existence in the `table_exists` function to perform case-insensitive comparisons and handle table existence checking based on the retrieved output, the corrected version should pass the failing tests and satisfy the expected input/output values.
