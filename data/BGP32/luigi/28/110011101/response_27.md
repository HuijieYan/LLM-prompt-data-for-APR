### Bug Explanation
The bug in the `table_exists` function is due to the way the return condition is checked. In the `if` branch, the condition `stdout and table in stdout` is checking if the `stdout` string is not empty and if the `table` exists in `stdout`. This logic is incorrect because a non-empty string evaluates to `True` regardless of the actual content. 

Furthermore, in the `else` branch, the condition `stdout` only checks if the `stdout` string is not empty, which does not accurately verify the existence of the table.

### Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to check if the table name is present in the `stdout` string correctly. If the table exists, the name should appear in the output, and we should check that it is not an empty string before considering it as present.

### Corrected Version of the Function
```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
            return stdout != "" and table in stdout.strip().splitlines()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
            return stdout != ""
```

In the corrected version:
- We first check if the `stdout` string is not empty (`stdout != ""`) to ensure that the command ran successfully.
- For the table existence check, we split the `stdout` by lines using `strip().splitlines()` which allows us to handle multiple tables if they are listed in the output. Then, we check if the `table` is present in the list of tables returned by `stdout`.

This corrected version should address the bug and pass the failing tests.
