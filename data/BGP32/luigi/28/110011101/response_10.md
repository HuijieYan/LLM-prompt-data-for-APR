The bug in the `table_exists` function seems to be related to how the function checks if a table exists in the database using the output from `run_hive_cmd`. The bug occurs because the function is not correctly handling the case where the table name might be present in the output but not as a standalone entity, resulting in incorrect boolean evaluations.

The buggy function tries to determine the existence of a table based on the output of the Hive command used, but it doesn't accurately account for different scenarios like case insensitivity or the presence of the table name within other text.

To fix the bug, we should modify the function to handle these cases more robustly. Specifically, we should check if the table name is a standalone word in the output to ensure accurate matching. Additionally, handling case insensitivity is crucial to prevent false negatives in table existence checks.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower().split()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                                (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

            return bool(stdout)
```

By turning both the table name and output to lower case before comparison and splitting the stdout content, we ensure that the table name is matched as a standalone entity. This modification should resolve the issues with the buggy function failing the tests.
