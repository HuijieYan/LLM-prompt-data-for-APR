### Bug Explanation
The bug in the `table_exists` function lies in the condition check for the presence of the table name in the `stdout`. In the first branch when `partition` is `None`, the function checks if the `table` is in `stdout`, but in the second branch when a `partition` is provided, it checks if `stdout` is not empty without actually verifying the presence of the table name.

This bug leads to incorrect results being returned in certain scenarios, causing the test cases to fail.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the function correctly checks for the presence of the table name in `stdout` regardless of the partition condition. We can simplify the function to always check if the `table` is in `stdout` and return True or False accordingly.

### Corrected Code
```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is not None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                             (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return table in stdout if stdout else False
```

This corrected version of the `table_exists` function ensures that it properly checks for the existence of the table name in the `stdout` output and returns True if found, False otherwise.
