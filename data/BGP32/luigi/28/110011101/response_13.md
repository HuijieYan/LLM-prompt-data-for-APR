### Bug Analysis
The bug seems to be in the logic of the `table_exists` function. In the failing tests, for a table that exists, the function returns `False`, causing the assertion error. This indicates a problem in the condition checks and return values within the function. The function is not handling the output of the `run_hive_cmd` function correctly when checking for table existence.

### Bug Explanation
1. In both cases, the function checks if `stdout` (the output of the `run_hive_cmd` function) contains the table name. However, the condition `return stdout and table in stdout` is incorrect. It should check if the table name is present in the `stdout` string.
2. In the second case, where the table name is in the `stdout`, the function still returns `False`, leading to the assertion error.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug:
1. Modify the condition to check if the table name is in the `stdout` string.
2. Ensure that the correct output is returned based on table existence.

### Corrected Version
```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
            return table in stdout
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

            return bool(stdout)  # Return True if stdout is not empty, otherwise False
```

With this corrected version, the function should now correctly check for the existence of the table in the output of the `run_hive_cmd` function and return the expected results.
