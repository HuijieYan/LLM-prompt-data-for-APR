### Analysis
1. The function `table_exists` in the `HiveCommandClient` class is intended to check if a table exists in a given database.
2. The function uses the `run_hive_cmd` function to interact with the Hive command line interface.
3. The bug seems to occur due to the inconsistency in checking for the existence of tables in the returned output.
4. The function should correctly parse the stdout response and check if the table name is present in it.
5. The current implementation doesn't handle the cases where the table name appears within other text in the output.

### Bug Cause
The bug occurs because the function erroneously checks for exact string matches to verify table existence in the Hive output. This leads to false negatives when the table name is embedded within other text in the returned output.

### Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to modify the function to accurately detect the presence of the table name in the stdout response. We can split the stdout by newline characters and check if the table name is present in any of the lines.

### Corrected Version
```python
# The corrected version of the function
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
    
            return stdout and any(table in line for line in stdout.split('\n'))
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                                (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
    
            if stdout:
                return True
            else:
                return False
```

By using the `any` function with a generator expression to check if the table name exists in any of the lines split by newline characters, we ensure a more robust check for table existence in the Hive output.
