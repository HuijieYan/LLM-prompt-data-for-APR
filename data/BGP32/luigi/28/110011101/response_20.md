### Bug Explanation
The bug in the `table_exists` function arises from the comparison of the `stdout` variable with the table name. The bug is caused by the condition `return stdout and table in stdout`, where the return value is not directly checking if the table exists in the `stdout` output from the `run_hive_cmd`. Instead, it's checking if both `stdout` is not empty and the table name is present in the `stdout`. This approach can lead to unexpected behavior, especially if the `stdout` contains additional unwanted characters or spaces.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to modify the condition to directly check if the table name is present in the `stdout` output. This approach will ensure that the function correctly determines table existence based on the exact match of the table name in the `stdout`.

### Corrected Code

```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

            return table in stdout  # Directly check if the table name is present in the stdout
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

            return bool(stdout)  # Return True if stdout is not empty
```

By modifying the return conditions as described above, the function should now correctly determine if a table exists based on the table name being present in the `stdout` output, without any unnecessary and potentially problematic checks.
