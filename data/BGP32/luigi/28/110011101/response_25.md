### Bug Explanation
The bug in the `table_exists` function stems from the condition checks before returning the result. In the `if stdout:` and `return stdout and table in stdout` statements, the logic is flawed. The function is trying to check if the table exists in the output of the Hive command, but it doesn't handle the case where the table is not found properly.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to update the `table_exists` function to correctly handle cases where the table is not found. We should modify the condition checks to explicitly check for the presence of the table in the output of the Hive command and return `True` if found, and `False` otherwise.

### Corrected Code
```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """
    
    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
    
            return table in stdout.split('\n') if stdout else False
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                                (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
    
            return bool(stdout)
```

This corrected version of the function properly handles the scenario where the table is not found, returning `False` in such cases. This modification aligns the function's behavior with the expected results from the failing tests.
