### Bug Fix Strategy:
The bug in the `table_exists` function seems to be related to the condition for returning `True` or `False` based on the presence of the table in the `stdout`. The bug causes incorrect handling of the stdout content and leads to failing test cases.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the function correctly checks the existence of the table in the stdout by properly parsing the output.

### Corrected Version:
```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
            return stdout and table in stdout
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use {0}; show partitions {1} partition ({2})""".format(database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
            return 'OK' in stdout.split('\n')  # Check if 'OK' exists in the lines of stdout
    
```

By splitting the stdout by the newline character and checking if `'OK'` is present in any of those lines, we can accurately determine the existence of the table. This corrected version should pass the failing test cases and handle the output parsing correctly.
