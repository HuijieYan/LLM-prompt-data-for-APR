### Bug Explanation
The bug in the `table_exists` function arises from the condition where the function checks for the presence of the table name in the `stdout` variable. The bug causes the function to return the opposite of what is expected based on the content of `stdout`.

- In Case 1, the function should return True since the table exists, but it incorrectly returns False due to a mistaken logic inversion when checking the `stdout` variable.
- In Case 2, the function should return True since the table exists, but it incorrectly returns False due to the same logic bug as in Case 1.
- The same logic error occurs in the other cases as well, causing incorrect results.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to correct the logic of how the function checks for the table existence in the `stdout` variable. Instead of returning based on the presence of the table name in `stdout`, we should return based on the absence of the table name not being found.

### Corrected Version of the Function
```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
    
            return stdout and table in stdout.split()

        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
    
            return bool(stdout)
``` 

By splitting the `stdout` variable where necessary and correcting the return logic, the function should now pass the failing tests and correctly determine the existence of tables as expected.
