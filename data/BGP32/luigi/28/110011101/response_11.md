### Bug Explanation
The bug in the `table_exists` function arises from the conditional check of the `stdout` variable. In the first branch of the conditional, the function checks if `stdout` contains the table name, but it improperly returns based on the presence of `stdout` instead of the table name within it. This leads to incorrect behavior and failing test cases.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, the function should correctly check if the table name exists in the `stdout`. The `table in stdout` check should be used regardless of the contents of `stdout` to ensure the function behaves as expected.

### Corrected Code
```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: luigi/contrib/hive.py

class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
            return table in stdout
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                                (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
            return bool(stdout)
``` 

By correcting the conditional return statement to properly check for the existence of the table name in the `stdout`, the function will now behave as expected and pass the failing test cases.
