### Bug Explanation
The bug in the `table_exists` function occurs because of how the return values are being checked. In the first condition where `partition` is None, the function checks if `stdout` is not empty and if the `table` is in `stdout`, which is correct. However, in the second condition where `partition` is not None, the function just checks if `stdout` is not empty, leading to a False result even if the table exists.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to modify the second condition where `partition` is not None to check if the specific table name exists in the `stdout` irrespective of it being empty or not.

### Corrected Version

```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: luigi/contrib/hive.py

class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
    
            return stdout and table in stdout
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                                (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
    
            return stdout and table in stdout
```

By making the appropriate check in the second condition for `partition`, the corrected version of the function should handle both cases correctly and pass the failing tests.
