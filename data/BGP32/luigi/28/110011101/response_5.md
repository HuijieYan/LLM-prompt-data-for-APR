### Bug Explanation:
The bug in the `table_exists` function is due to the condition checking for the existence of the table. In the first condition, the function correctly checks if the `table` exists in the `stdout`. However, in the else condition, the function is checking for the existence of `stdout` instead of checking if `table` exists in `stdout`. This results in the incorrect return values and the failing tests.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the function correctly checks if the `table` exists in the `stdout` in both conditions. We can achieve this by modifying the return statements to check if `table` is in `stdout` as expected.

### Corrected Function:
```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
    
            return stdout and table in stdout
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                                (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
    
            return stdout and table in stdout
```

By modifying the return statements in both conditions to check if the `table` exists in `stdout`, we ensure that the function correctly determines if the table exists. This corrected function should now pass the failing tests and satisfy the expected input/output values.
