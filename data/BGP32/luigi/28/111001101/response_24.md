### Bug Explanation
The bug in the `table_exists` function is in the way it checks for the existence of a table in the Hive database. When a table name contains uppercase characters, the function fails to correctly identify the table, leading to incorrect results. This discrepancy occurs because the function compares the table name directly to the output of the Hive command, which may not match due to case sensitivity.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the comparison between the table name and the output from the Hive command is case-insensitive. One way to achieve this is by converting both strings to lowercase before comparison.

### Corrected Version of the Function
```python
# The corrected version of the buggy function
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
    
        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
    
        return bool(stdout)
``` 

In the corrected version, both the `table` parameter and the `stdout` output are converted to lowercase before comparison using the `lower()` method. This ensures a case-insensitive match, addressing the bug in the original implementation.
