The buggy function has an issue with how it checks for the existence of a table in a Hive database. The bug seems to be in the way the function checks the existence of the table in the stdout returned by the `run_hive_cmd` function.

The issue lies in the conditional checks within the `table_exists` function. The function checks if `stdout` contains the table name directly, which may lead to incorrect results if the table name is a substring of another table name in the output. This can cause false positives or false negatives when checking for table existence.

To fix this bug, we should modify the condition to check for exact matches of the table name in each line of the `stdout` output returned by the `run_hive_cmd` function. We can split the `stdout` by lines and then check if any line matches the table name exactly.

Here is the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return any(t.strip() == table for t in stdout.split("\n"))
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        return bool(stdout)
```

This revised version uses `any` to check for an exact match of the table name in each line of the `stdout` output. This should improve the accuracy of the table existence check.
