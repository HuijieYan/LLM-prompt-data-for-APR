The bug in the `table_exists` function is that the condition to check if the table exists is flawed. The function checks if the `stdout` variable is not empty and if the `table` is in `stdout`. However, in Case 2 and Case 4, the `table` is not found in `stdout` because of a mismatch in case sensitivity. In Case 2, `MyTable` is not equal to `mytable`, causing the function to incorrectly return `False`. 

To fix this bug, we should modify the condition to check if the lowercase version of `table` exists in the lowercase version of `stdout`. This way, case sensitivity won't affect the comparison.

Here is the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                              (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
``` 

This corrected code ensures that the comparison is done in a case-insensitive manner, allowing the function to correctly determine if the table exists in Hive.
