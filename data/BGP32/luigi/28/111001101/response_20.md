### Analysis
The buggy function `table_exists` is designed to check if a given table exists in a database with an optional partition specification. The bug seems to arise from the condition to check if the table is in the output retrieved from the `run_hive_cmd` function.

### Issues
1. In the `if` condition `return stdout and table in stdout`, it checks if stdout is not empty and the table is in stdout. This might lead to unexpected behavior if the output contains other text along with the table name.
2. In the else condition, after querying partitions for a table, the function always returns True, which is incorrect.

### Bug Fix Strategy
1. Separate the logic to check if the table exists from the output parsing.
2. Modify the logic to correctly handle the case where the table is not found in the output of the `run_hive_cmd`.
3. Ensure that the function returns False if the table is not found in the specified database.
4. Adjust the partition query logic to return True only if the partition exists for the given table.
5. Take into account the partition information when checking if a table exists with giving partition details.

### Bug-fixed Version
```python
# The relative path of the corrected function: luigi/contrib/hive.py

def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
        return stdout.strip() == table  # Check if the table is exactly the same in the output
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd(f"use {database}; show partitions {table} partition ({self.partition_spec(partition)})")
        return stdout.strip() != ""  # Check if partitions exist for the specified table
```

This corrected version ensures that the function accurately checks if a table exists in the specified database, considering both the table name and potential partitions.
