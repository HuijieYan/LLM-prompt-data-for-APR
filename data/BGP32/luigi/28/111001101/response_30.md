Based on the provided information, the bug seems to be related to how the function handles the output of the `run_hive_cmd` function and checks for table existence. The function currently checks if the table name is in the output string, which can lead to false positives if the table name is a substring of another table name in the output.

To fix this bug, we should modify the function to check for exact matches of table names in the output.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: luigi/contrib/hive.py

# This function from the same file, but not the same class, is called by the buggy function
def run_hive_cmd(hivecmd, check_return_code=True):
    # Please ignore the body of this function

# The declaration of the class containing the buggy function
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """


    # This function from the same class is called by the buggy function
    def partition_spec(self, partition):
        # Please ignore the body of this function



    # this is the corrected function
    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
    
            return stdout and table in stdout.split()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                                (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
    
            return bool(stdout)
```

In the corrected version, we use the `split()` function to separate the table names in the output string and check if the exact table name is present in the list of tables. This modification ensures that we are checking for the exact table name existence.

This fix should address the bug and provide the expected behavior in all the specified test cases.
