## Bug fix and corrected version

The bug in the `table_exists` function is caused by the condition checking for the presence of the table name in the output from the `run_hive_cmd` function. The bug arises because the name of the table might appear as part of another table name or text in the output. One way to fix this is to split the `stdout` by newline characters and then check if the table name is a standalone entry in the list.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: luigi/contrib/hive.py

# This function from the same file, but not the same class, is called by the buggy function
def run_hive_cmd(hivecmd, check_return_code=True):
    # Please ignore the body of this function

# The declaration of the class containing the buggy function
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """


    # This function from the same class is called by the buggy function
    def partition_spec(self, partition):
        # Please ignore the body of this function



    # this is the corrected function
    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
    
            return stdout and table in stdout.split('\n')
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                                (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
    
            return True if stdout else False
```

This corrected version splits the `stdout` by newline characters before checking for the table name, ensuring that the table name is an individual entry in the list. This modification addresses the bug and aligns the function's behavior with the expected input/output values provided.
