### Bug in the Buggy Function

The bug in the `table_exists` function stems from the way the `stdout` variable is checked for the existence of the `table` within it. The function is designed to return `True` if the `table` exists in the `stdout` output from the `run_hive_cmd` function, otherwise it returns `False`. However, the check for the existence of the `table` is flawed leading to incorrect results.

### Bug Explanation
In the buggy function:
- In the first part, the `stdout` is checked for the direct presence of the `table`, which may lead to incorrect results if the `table` is part of another word in the output.
- In the second part, when the `partition` is not `None`, the partition specification is not handled properly causing potential issues with the comparison against the `stdout`.

### Fix Strategy
To fix this bug, we need to modify the `table_exists` function to properly parse the `stdout` output from the `run_hive_cmd` function and ensure that the comparison against the table name is precise.

### Corrected Version of the Function

```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: luigi/contrib/hive.py

# This function from the same file, but not the same class, is called by the buggy function
def run_hive_cmd(hivecmd, check_return_code=True):
    # Please ignore the body of this function

# The declaration of the class containing the buggy function
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """

    # This function from the same class is called by the buggy function
    def partition_spec(self, partition):
        # Please ignore the body of this function

    # The corrected version of the buggy function
    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables in {1}'.format(database, table))
            tables = stdout.split('\n')
            return table in tables
        else:
            partition_str = ','.join(['{0} = "{1}"'.format(k, v) for k, v in partition.items()])
            query = 'SHOW PARTITIONS {0}.{1} PARTITION ({2})'.format(database, table, partition_str)
            stdout = run_hive_cmd(query)
            partitions = stdout.split('\n')
            return len(partitions) > 1  # Checking if partition exists

``` 

This corrected version addresses the issues by parsing the `stdout` output correctly in both cases, ensuring the comparison against the `table` and partition details is accurate.
