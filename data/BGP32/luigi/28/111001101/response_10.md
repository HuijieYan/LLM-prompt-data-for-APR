The bug in the provided function `table_exists` lies in the condition checking for the presence of the table in the `stdout` variable. The function checks if `stdout` is not empty, but in the case where `stdout` is not empty, it directly checks for the table name, which leads to incorrect results.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the condition to check if the table name is present in the `stdout` variable. This ensures that we are correctly verifying the existence of the table in the output of the `run_hive_cmd` function.

Here is the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
    
        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                        (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
    
        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

By converting both the `table` and `stdout` values to lowercase before comparison, we ensure a case-insensitive check for the table existence in the database.

This corrected version should now pass all the provided test cases and provide the expected output for each case.
