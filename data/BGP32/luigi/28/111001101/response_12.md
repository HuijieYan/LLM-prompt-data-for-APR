## Bug Explanation
The bug in the `table_exists` function lies in the condition checking for the table existence in the output of the `run_hive_cmd` function. The function checks if the table name is present in the entire stdout string, which can lead to incorrect results if the table name is a substring of another table's name.

## Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to modify the condition to check if the table name appears as a whole word in the stdout string. This can be achieved by splitting the stdout string by newline characters and then checking each line individually.

## Corrected Code
Here is the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: luigi/contrib/hive.py

# Importing necessary function from the same file
from re import search

# The declaration of the class containing the buggy function
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """

    # this is the corrected function
    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
    
            return any(search(r'\b{}\b'.format(table), line) for line in stdout.split('\n'))
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
    
            return bool(stdout)
```

This corrected version uses regular expressions to search for the table name as a whole word in each line of the stdout string, ensuring correct table existence checking.
