The bug in the provided function lies in the logic of checking if a table exists in a database with or without partition. The issue occurs when checking for tables that are case-sensitive. 

The bug arises from the comparison of table names in a case-sensitive manner. The `table_exists` function performs a comparison between the table name obtained from the hive command output (stdout) and the provided table name. This check is done without considering case sensitivity, leading to incorrect results.

To fix the bug, we need to perform a case-insensitive comparison between the table names. We can achieve this by converting both table names to lowercase before the comparison.

Here is the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in map(str.lower, stdout.split())
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

In the corrected version, we convert both the provided table name and the table names obtained from the hive command output to lowercase before the comparison. This ensures that the comparison is done in a case-insensitive manner, fixing the bug related to case sensitivity in table name checking.
