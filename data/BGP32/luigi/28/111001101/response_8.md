The bug in the `table_exists` function occurs because it assumes that the `run_hive_cmd` function will return the exact table names without any additional formatting or newlines. However, in the failing cases provided, the stdout contains extra characters (e.g., newline characters) which cause the equality check `table in stdout` to fail.

To fix the bug, we need to remove any extra characters from the `stdout` before performing the check.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
    
        return stdout and table in stdout.strip()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                        (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
    
        return bool(stdout)
```

The modification includes using the `strip()` function on `stdout` to remove leading and trailing whitespaces, including newline characters, before checking for table existence. This change ensures that the comparison with `table` is accurate and fixes the bug in the function.
