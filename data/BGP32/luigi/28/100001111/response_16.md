The buggy function `table_exists` in the `luigi/contrib/hive.py` file needs to be fixed to address the case sensitivity issue as mentioned in the GitHub issue.

### Error location:
The bug arises in the comparison of the table name with the stdout obtained from the Hive command. Since Hive is case insensitive, the comparison should be case-sensitive to avoid failures.

### Cause of the bug:
The bug occurs because the function compares the table name directly with the stdout without converting either of them to a consistent case, leading to failures when the cases do not match.

### Strategy for fixing the bug:
To fix the bug, we need to convert both the table name and the stdout to a consistent case (e.g., lowercase) before performing the comparison. This ensures that the comparison is case insensitive, as desired.

### Updated correct code:
```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

This corrected version ensures that both the `table` and `stdout` are converted to lowercase before the comparison, making the function case insensitive, as suggested in the GitHub issue.
