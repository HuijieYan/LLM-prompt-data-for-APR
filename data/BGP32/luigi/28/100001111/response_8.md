The buggy function `table_exists` in the `luigi/contrib/hive.py` file is causing issues related to case sensitivity when checking for table existence in Hive.

### Potential Error Locations:
1. The comparison between the `table` name and `stdout` is case-sensitive, leading to test failures if the case does not match perfectly.
2. The comparison should be case-insensitive to handle scenarios where the table names are in different cases.

### Bug Cause:
The bug arises from the function returning `False` when the `table` is not found in `stdout` due to case sensitivity. The incorrect behavior is evident from the failing tests provided.

### Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug and address the GitHub issue, we need to modify the comparison condition to be case-insensitive. By converting both the `table` and `stdout` to lowercase, the function can accurately determine if the table exists in Hive.

### Corrected Function:
```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

By making the comparison case-insensitive using `table.lower()` and `stdout.lower()`, the corrected function addresses the bug and aligns with the expected input/output values and the GitHub issue's request for case insensitivity in checking table existence.
