The bug in the provided function `table_exists` stems from a case sensitivity issue when checking if a table exists in Hive. The function compares the table name directly with the stdout, which can lead to false negatives due to case differences. The GitHub issue highlights this problem and suggests making the comparison case insensitive by converting both the table name and the stdout to lowercase before checking for existence.

To fix this bug, we need to update the function to ensure a case-insensitive comparison. Here is the corrected version:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

In the updated version, both the table name and the stdout are converted to lowercase using the `lower()` function before comparison. This correction ensures that the function will correctly identify the table's existence even if there are case differences between the table name and the returned table names from Hive.
