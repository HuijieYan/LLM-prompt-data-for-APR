The buggy function `table_exists` has a flaw in how it compares the table name in the output with the actual table name, leading to case sensitivity issues mentioned in the GitHub issue. The function does not convert the table name to lowercase before comparison with the output.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the function to convert both the table name and the output to lowercase for comparison.

Here is the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

By converting both the table name and the output to lowercase before comparison, we ensure that the function is now case insensitive and can correctly identify the table existence regardless of the case of the table name.

This correction aligns with the expected behavior outlined in the failing test cases and addresses the case sensitivity issue described in the GitHub issue.
