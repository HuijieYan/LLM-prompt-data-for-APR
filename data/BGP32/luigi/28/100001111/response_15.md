### Analysis:
The buggy function `table_exists` in the `hive.py` file of the `luigi` library is supposed to check if a table exists in a Hive database. However, it has an issue related to case sensitivity of table names which causes tests to fail. The function does not account for case differences between the table name being checked and the actual table name in the database.

### Potential Error Locations:
1. The comparison between the `table` and the `stdout` may be case-sensitive.
2. The format of the `stdout` retrieved from the Hive database may not match the case of the table name passed to the function.

### Bug Cause:
The bug occurs because the function directly compares the `table` name with the `stdout` retrieved from the Hive database without considering case sensitivity. If the table names have different cases, the comparison will fail even if the table exists. This behavior was altered in newer versions causing the tests to fail.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure case insensitivity in comparing the table name with the output from the Hive database. By converting both to lowercase or uppercase before comparison, we can eliminate case issues while checking for table existence.

### Corrected Version:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

In the corrected version, both the `table` and the `stdout` are converted to lowercase before comparison using `lower()` method. This approach makes the comparison case-insensitive, ensuring that the function behaves correctly with different table name cases.
