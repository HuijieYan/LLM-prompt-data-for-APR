The issue with the `table_exists` function is that it is not case insensitive when checking for table existence in Hive. The function needs to compare the table name in a case insensitive manner to prevent mismatches due to different capitalizations.

The strategy for fixing the bug:
1. Modify the function to convert both the table name and the output from Hive to lowercase for comparison.
2. Ensure that the comparison is done in a case-insensitive manner to accurately determine table existence.

Here is the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
        return stdout
``` 

This correction ensures that both the table name and the output from Hive are converted to lowercase for a case-insensitive comparison, fixing the bug as mentioned in the GitHub issue.
