### Explanation:
The bug in the `table_exists` function is due to case sensitivity when comparing the table names retrieved from Hive with the input table name. The function currently directly compares the output table names (stdout) with the input table name, leading to failures when there is a case mismatch.

The GitHub issue provides insight into this problem, suggesting that Hive is case-insensitive, and comparing the table names in a case-insensitive manner would resolve the issue.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to modify the function to compare the table names case-insensitively. This can be achieved by converting both the input table name and the retrieved table names to lowercase before comparing them.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
        return bool(stdout)
```

By converting both the input table name (`table`) and the retrieved table names from Hive to lowercase before comparison, we ensure a case-insensitive check. This corrected version should address the bug and align with the expected input/output values as well as the GitHub issue discussions.
