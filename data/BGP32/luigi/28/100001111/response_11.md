Based on the information provided, the bug in the `table_exists` function is that it is not handling the case sensitivity of table names correctly. The function is comparing the table name directly with the output from Hive without considering case differences, leading to test failures.

The strategy to fix the bug is to make the comparison case insensitive by converting both the table name and the Hive output to lowercase before comparison.

Here is the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

In the corrected version, both the table name and the Hive output are converted to lowercase before comparison, ensuring a case-insensitive check. This fix aligns with the GitHub issue's suggestion to make `table_exists` case insensitive and addresses the reported bug effectively.
