The bug in the `table_exists` function stems from case sensitivity when comparing table names in Hive. The function needs to be updated to be case insensitive to handle situations where table names might have different cases. The issue on GitHub and the failing test cases clearly indicate the need for this modification.

To fix this bug, we should modify the function to compare the lowercase version of the table name with the lowercase version of the string obtained from the Hive command `stdout`.

Here is the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

This adjustment ensures that the comparison is performed in a case-insensitive manner by converting both the table name and the command output to lowercase.

By implementing this change, the `table_exists` function should now be able to correctly handle different cases in table names and prevent the failing tests identified in the GitHub issue from occurring.
