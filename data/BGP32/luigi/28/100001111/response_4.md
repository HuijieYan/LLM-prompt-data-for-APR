The buggy function is checking whether a table exists in a Hive database, with the possibility of specifying a partition. The issue arises due to case sensitivity, where the table names might differ in case between the input and the actual database.

The bug is that the function does a case-sensitive check on the table name in the database output, which causes issues when the case differs. The suggested fix from the GitHub issue is to make the comparison case-insensitive by converting both the table name and the output to lowercase before checking for existence.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: luigi/contrib/hive.py

def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

In the corrected version, the table name `table` and the `stdout` output are converted to lowercase before comparing for existence, ensuring a case-insensitive check. This modification aligns with the suggested fix mentioned in the GitHub issue.
