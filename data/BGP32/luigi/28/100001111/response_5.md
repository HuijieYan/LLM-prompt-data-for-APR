The buggy function `table_exists` in the `luigi/contrib/hive.py` file has a bug related to case sensitivity with table names when checking for table existence in Hive. The function does not handle case sensitivity correctly, leading to test failures when comparing table names.

### Error Location:
The bug is located in how the function compares the table name with the output received from Hive. The function directly compares the table name without considering case sensitivity.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is caused by Hive being case insensitive and returning table names in lowercase, while the function compares the table name in its original case without converting it to lowercase.

### Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, it is necessary to convert both the table name and the output from Hive to lowercase for a case-insensitive comparison.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

By converting both the table name and the output to lowercase before comparison, the corrected function will be case-insensitive, resolving the issue mentioned in the GitHub topics and passing the test cases successfully.
