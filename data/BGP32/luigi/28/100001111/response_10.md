Based on the provided information and the GitHub issue related to making the `table_exists` function case insensitive, the bug is identified in the comparison between the table name and the output from the Hive command, which causes case sensitivity issues. To fix this bug, we need to make the comparison case-insensitive.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

In this corrected version, both the table name and the output from the Hive command are converted to lowercase using the `lower()` method before comparison. This ensures that the comparison is case-insensitive, solving the bug described in the GitHub issue.
