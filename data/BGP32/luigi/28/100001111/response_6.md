Based on the analysis of the buggy function and the provided cases, the bug arises from a case sensitivity issue when checking if a table exists in Hive. The function does not handle uppercase and lowercase table names correctly, leading to incorrect results.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the comparison between the table name and the output from Hive is case-insensitive.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: luigi/contrib/hive.py

def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
        return bool(stdout)
``` 

This corrected version ensures that both the table name and the output from Hive are converted to lowercase before the comparison. This adjustment makes the check case-insensitive, resolving the bug reported in the GitHub issue.
