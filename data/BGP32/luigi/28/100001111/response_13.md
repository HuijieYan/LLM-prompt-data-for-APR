### Analysis:
The buggy function `table_exists` in the `luigi/contrib/hive.py` file fails to correctly identify table existence when the table names are in different cases due to a lack of case insensitivity. This issue was reported in GitHub and suggests making the function case insensitive by comparing the table name in lowercase with the processed `stdout`.

### Error locations:
1. The function does not handle case sensitivity when checking for table existence.
2. It directly compares the table name with the `stdout` without considering case issues, leading to potential failures.

### Bug Explanation:
The bug causes failures when the table names have different cases compared to the case of the names received in the `stdout` from the Hive queries. When checking for a table like 'TableName', if 'tableName' is received from `stdout`, the function fails to identify it as an existing table, even though it may exist.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To resolve the bug, the function needs to be modified to be case insensitive. By converting the table name to lowercase before comparing it with the `stdout` values, the function can accurately identify existing tables regardless of case differences.

### Corrected Function:
```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
``` 

By comparing the lowercase version of the table name with the lowercase version of the `stdout`, the corrected function addresses the case sensitivity issue and will accurately determine the existence of tables in Hive.
