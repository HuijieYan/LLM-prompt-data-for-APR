### Analysis:
The buggy function `table_exists` in the `luigi/contrib/hive.py` file has a bug where it does not handle case sensitivity properly when checking for table existence in Hive. The bug is evident from the GitHub issues where it is mentioned that the function should be case insensitive. The function should compare the table names in a case-insensitive manner to avoid failures.

### Error Locations:
1. The function compares the table name directly with the output from the Hive command without considering the case.
2. The condition `and table in stdout` does a case-sensitive check, causing failures when the table names don't match exactly.

### Cause of the Bug:
The bug arises because the function does not handle case sensitivity properly. When checking for the existence of a table, it directly compares the table name without considering the case of the characters. As Hive is case insensitive, this approach leads to failures when the case of the table name does not match exactly with the output from Hive.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to modify the comparison of the table name with the output from Hive to be case insensitive. We should convert both the table name and the output to lowercase or uppercase before comparing them. This approach will ensure that the comparison is not affected by the case of the characters.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

The corrected version of the function now converts both the table name and the output to lowercase before comparing them. This modification ensures a case-insensitive check for table existence in Hive, fixing the bug reported in the GitHub issue.
