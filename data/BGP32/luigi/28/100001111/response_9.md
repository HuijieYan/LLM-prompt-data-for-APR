### Bug Analysis:
The buggy function `table_exists` has a bug where it is not handling case sensitivity when checking for the existence of a table in Hive. The function compares the table name directly with the output from Hive, which may cause issues due to case differences.

From the GitHub issue provided, it is clear that the function should be case insensitive when checking for table existence. The proposed fix is to convert both the table name and the output to lowercase before comparison.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
1. Convert both the `table` name and the `stdout` output to lowercase for case-insensitive comparison.
2. Update the return statements to reflect the correct comparison using lowercase strings.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

By making the comparison case insensitive using lowercase strings, the corrected function guarantees that the table name check is accurate and resolves the issue mentioned in the GitHub thread.
