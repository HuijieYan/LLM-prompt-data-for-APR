The buggy function `table_exists` in the `luigi/contrib/hive.py` file has a bug related to case sensitivity when checking for table existence in Hive. The function compares the table name directly with the output from Hive's `show tables` command without considering the case of the table names.

The root cause of the bug is the direct comparison of the table name with the table names returned by Hive, which may be in a different case. This comparison leads to incorrect results when the cases do not match, resulting in false negatives.

To fix the bug, we need to make the comparison case-insensitive by converting both the table name and the table names from Hive to lower case. This approach ensures that the comparison is accurate regardless of the case used in the table names.

Here is the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                        (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

This corrected version ensures that the comparison between the table name and the output from Hive is case-insensitive, fixing the bug reported in the GitHub issue. Now the function checks the lowercase version of both the table name and the output from Hive before determining the table existence.
