The bug in the `table_exists` function arises due to a case mismatch between the table name being checked for existence in Hive and the actual table names returned in the stdout. The function does not consider case sensitivity, resulting in test failures where the case of the table name does not match that of the returned table names in Hive.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the function to make it case insensitive when comparing the table names. By converting both the table name and the output table names to lowercase (or uppercase) before comparing them, we can ensure that the comparison is not affected by the case discrepancy.

Below is the corrected version of the `table_exists` function that addresses the case sensitivity issue:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
    
        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                        (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
    
        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

This corrected version converts both the `table` and the `stdout` to lowercase before checking for existence. This modification ensures that the function is now case insensitive when comparing table names, resolving the issue described in the GitHub bug reports.

By using this corrected version of the function, the test cases should now pass as the function will handle different table name cases correctly.
