The bug in the provided function `table_exists` is that it checks for the exact table name in a case-sensitive manner, while Hive is case-insensitive. This causes issues when the table names are entered with differing cases. To fix this bug, we need to make the comparison case-insensitive by converting both the table name and the output to lowercase before comparison.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

This modification ensures that both the table name and the output are converted to lowercase before comparison, making the function case-insensitive. This resolves the issue described in the GitHub report where tables defined with different casing were causing test failures.
