Based on the analysis of the buggy function and the provided runtime input/output values, expected input/output values, and GitHub issue information, it is clear that the bug lies in the comparison of the table name in a case-sensitive manner. 

The issue describes a situation where table names may vary in case sensitivity, causing incorrect comparisons in the function `table_exists`. The suggested fix is to make the comparison case insensitive by converting the table name to lowercase before checking it against the output from Hive.

To address this bug, we can modify the function `table_exists` to convert the table name to lowercase before comparing it to the stdout from Hive. This modification will ensure a consistent comparison and fix the case sensitivity issue.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

This corrected version of the function will ensure that table names are compared in a case-insensitive manner, resolving the issue described in the GitHub report.
