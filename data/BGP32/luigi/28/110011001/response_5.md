### Bug Explanation

The bug in the `table_exists` function lies in the way it checks if a table exists in the database. When returning `stdout` and checking if the table name is in it, the condition `stdout and table in stdout` is flawed. If `stdout` contains anything other than an empty string, the condition will evaluate to `True`, regardless of whether the table name is actually present in `stdout`.

In cases where `stdout` contains the table name followed by more characters (as in Case 2 and Case 4), the function incorrectly returns `True` even if the table name is not an exact match.

### Fix Strategy

To fix the bug, we need to modify the condition for checking the existence of the table. Instead of relying on the truthiness of `stdout`, we should search for the table name in the output using a more specific approach. One way to achieve this is by splitting the `stdout` into lines and checking if the table name matches exactly one of the lines.

### Corrected Version of the Function

```python
# The relative path of the fixed file: luigi/contrib/hive.py

# The declaration of the class containing the buggy function
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """

    
    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
            return any(line.strip() == table for line in stdout.split('\n') if line.strip())
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                                (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
            return bool(stdout)
```

This corrected version splits the `stdout` into lines and then checks each line to see if it matches the table name exactly. This approach ensures that the function only returns `True` if the table name exactly matches one of the lines in `stdout`, fixing the bug identified.
