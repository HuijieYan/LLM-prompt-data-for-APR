### Analysis:
1. The function `table_exists` in the `HiveCommandClient` class checks if a table exists in a given database.
2. The bug seems to be related to the comparison of the table name in the `stdout`.
3. The bug occurs because the `table in stdout` condition is incorrectly checking for an exact match of the table name within the entire `stdout` string, leading to failing test cases.
4. To fix the bug, we need to split the `stdout` string by newline characters and then check if the table name is present in the resulting list of strings.
5. We will update the function to split the `stdout` string and check for the existence of the table name after splitting.

### Corrected Version:
```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: luigi/contrib/hive.py

# The declaration of the class containing the buggy function
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """

    # Corrected version of the buggy function
    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
    
            return stdout and any(table in line for line in stdout.split('\n'))
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                                (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
    
            return bool(stdout)
```

By splitting the `stdout` string by newline characters and checking if the table name is present in any of the lines after the split, we ensure a more accurate check for the existence of the table in the database. This correction should resolve the failing test cases.
