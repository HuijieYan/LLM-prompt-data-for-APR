### Analysis:
1. The `table_exists` function in the `HiveCommandClient` class is supposed to check if a table exists in a given database. It does so by running a Hive command and then checking the output.
2. The bug seems to be related to how the function is parsing and checking the output of the Hive command.
3. The function checks for the presence of the table name in the `stdout` variable returned by the Hive command. In Case 2, the table name 'MyTable' is not being found in the `stdout` output even though it should be there.
4. The bug might be due to case sensitivity issues where the comparison between the table name in the Hive output and the expected table name is failing due to case mismatch.
5. To fix the bug, we can convert both the table names to lowercase or uppercase for comparison to avoid case sensitivity issues.

### Corrected Version:
```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: luigi/contrib/hive.py

# The declaration of the class containing the buggy function
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
    
            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                                (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
    
            if stdout:
                return True
            else:
                return False
```

By converting both the table names to lowercase before comparison, we can ensure that case sensitivity issues do not affect the function's logic. This corrected version should pass the failing tests.
