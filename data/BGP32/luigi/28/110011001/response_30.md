### Analysis:
The buggy function `table_exists` is intended to check if a table exists in a Hive database by running specific Hive commands. The issue arises from the comparison of the `stdout` variable with the table name.

### Bug:
The bug lies in the comparison `table in stdout`. In the failing test cases, the value of `stdout` contains additional information (like 'OK\n') along with the table name, causing the comparison to fail.

### Fix:
To fix the bug, we need to modify how we check if the table name exists in the output. We can split the `stdout` by newline characters and check if the table is present in any of the lines.

### Corrected Version:
```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
            return any(table in line for line in stdout.split('\n'))
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
            return bool(stdout)
```

By splitting the `stdout` output on newline characters and checking each line for the presence of the table name, we ensure that the function correctly identifies whether the table exists in the database.
