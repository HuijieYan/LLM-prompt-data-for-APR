### Analysis
The buggy function `table_exists` in the `HiveCommandClient` class is incorrectly checking for the existence of a table in a Hive database. The issue lies in the comparison logic that checks if the table name is in the response obtained from running a Hive command. The function incorrectly compares the table name with the entire response rather than checking if the table name appears in the response.

### Bug Cause
The bug occurs because the function is checking for an exact match between the table name and the entire response from the Hive command. In the failing tests, the table name appears in the response along with additional information, causing the comparison to fail.

### Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to modify the comparison logic so that it checks if the table name appears in the response obtained from running the Hive command.

### Corrected Function

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
    
        return stdout and table in stdout
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                        (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
    
        return table in stdout  # Check if table name appears in the response
```

By making this change, the function will correctly check if the table name exists within the response, allowing the tests to pass.
