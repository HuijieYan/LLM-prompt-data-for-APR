### Bug Analysis
The buggy function `table_exists` in the `HiveCommandClient` class is failing the tests due to incorrect logic in handling the output of the `run_hive_cmd` function. The function is supposed to check if a table exists in a database using Hive queries, but the condition for checking the response from `run_hive_cmd` is flawed.

The bug occurs when the function checks if the table exists in the stdout by using `table in stdout`. This condition will return false even if the table is present in the stdout but not at the beginning of the string. This results in the function returning incorrectly.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to modify the condition where we check if the table exists in the stdout. Instead of using `table in stdout`, we can split the stdout by newline characters and then check if the table name is present in any of the lines. This will ensure that we correctly identify if the table exists in the database.

### Corrected Version
```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table in stdout.split('\n')
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        return bool(stdout)
```

By splitting the stdout by newline characters and then checking if the table name is in any of the lines in the corrected version above, the function will be able to correctly identify whether the table exists or not.
