#### Bug Analysis
The bug in the `table_exists` function lies in how the function checks for the existence of a table. The function currently checks if the output contains the table name, which can lead to incorrect results.

In Case 2, the input table name is 'MyTable', which is not found in the output 'OK\nmytable', causing the function to return False. However, the expected behavior should be case-insensitive table name comparison.

#### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we should modify the function to perform a case-insensitive comparison when checking for the existence of the table.

#### Corrected Version of the Function
```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: luigi/contrib/hive.py

# The declaration of the class containing the buggy function
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """

    # Corrected version of the function
    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                                (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

            if stdout:
                return True
            else:
                return False
``` 

By converting both the table name and the output to lowercase before comparison, we ensure that the table existence check is case-insensitive. This correction should resolve the failing tests.
