### Explanation:
The buggy function `table_exists` in the `HiveCommandClient` class is not handling the case-sensitivity of table names properly. The function is checking if the table name exists in the output of the `run_hive_cmd`, but it is not accounting for case differences, which leads to the failing test cases where the table names have different cases.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to make the comparison case-insensitive. We can achieve this by converting both the table names and the output to lowercase before performing the check.

### Corrected Version:
```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: luigi/contrib/hive.py

# The declaration of the class containing the corrected function
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
    
            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                                (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
    
            if stdout:
                return True
            else:
                return False
```

By converting both the table name and the output to lowercase before comparison, the corrected `table_exists` function should now pass the failing test cases with different table name cases.
