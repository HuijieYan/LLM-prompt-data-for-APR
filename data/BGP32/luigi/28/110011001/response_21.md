### Analysis:
- The `table_exists` function is intended to check if a table exists in the specified database by running Hive commands.
- The bug seems to be related to the comparison of the table name in the output of the Hive commands.
- The function currently checks if the table name is directly present in the `stdout` of the command, which may lead to incorrect results due to partial matches.

### Error Cause:
- In the failing test cases, the `stdout` variable contains additional information or formatting that interferes with the direct comparison of the table name.
- The function compares the exact table name with the entire `stdout`, which causes false negatives or positives based on the formats.
- The buggy function doesn't handle partial matches or extra information present in the `stdout`.

### Fix Strategy:
- Modify the comparison logic to check for partial matches rather than exact matches to avoid issues with additional formatting in the `stdout`.
- Adjust the comparison to consider only relevant information related to the table name in the `stdout`.

### Corrected Function:
```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd(f'use {database}; show tables;')
            tables = [line.strip() for line in stdout.split('\n') if line.strip()]
            return table in tables
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd(f'use {database}; show partitions {table} partition ({self.partition_spec(partition)})')
            partition_info = [line.strip() for line in stdout.split('\n') if line.strip()]
            return bool(partition_info)
```

### Correction Rationale:
- In the corrected version, we split the `stdout` by lines and remove any empty lines to extract relevant information.
- For the case without partitions, we compare the table name with each table listed in the output, allowing for partial matches.
- For the case with partitions, we check if any partition information exists based on the table and partition specification.
- This approach avoids issues with incidental formatting in the `stdout` and ensures accurate table existence checks.
