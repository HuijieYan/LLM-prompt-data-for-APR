### Bug Analysis:
1. In the `table_exists` function, when checking if a table exists in the database, the condition to validate the existence of the table is incorrect in the `if` block.
2. The function currently checks if `table in stdout` to determine if the table exists. However, in the test cases provided, the output includes both the database and table names, causing the condition to fail.
3. The condition `return stdout and table in stdout` should be replaced with `return table in stdout` to accurately check if the table exists in the list of tables retrieved from Hive.

### Bug Fix:
1. Replace the `return stdout and table in stdout` line with `return table in stdout` to ensure correct validation of the table's existence in the database.
2. This fix will address the issue where the function fails to correctly determine the existence of a table due to the incorrect condition check.

### Corrected Version:
```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: luigi/contrib/hive.py

# The declaration of the class containing the buggy function
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """




    # this is the buggy function you need to fix
    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
    
            return table in stdout
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                                (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
    
            if stdout:
                return True
            else:
                return False
``` 

By making this correction, the function should now correctly verify the existence of tables in the database, and the provided test cases should pass without assertion errors.
