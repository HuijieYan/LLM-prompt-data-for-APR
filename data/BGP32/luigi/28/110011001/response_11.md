### Analysis:
1. The `table_exists` function in the `HiveCommandClient` class has a bug in the logic where it checks if a table exists in the specified database using Hive commands.
2. The bug seems to be related to how the function checks the presence of a table in the database and how it handles the case-insensitivity of table names.
3. The failing tests indicate that the function is not handling the case-insensitivity of table names correctly, leading to incorrect return values.
4. To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the comparison between the table name and the output from the Hive command is case-insensitive.
5. Additionally, we can simplify the logic of the function to make it more readable and resilient to different inputs.

### Fixing the bug:
```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables;'.format(database))
            tables = stdout.split('\n')

            return any(t.lower() == table.lower() for t in tables)
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""
                                use {0};
                                show partitions {1} partition ({2});
                                """.format(database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
    
            return bool(stdout)
```

In this corrected version of the function:
1. We retrieve all table names in the specified database and convert them to lowercase before checking for the existence of the specified table, making the comparison case-insensitive.
2. We also simplified the logic for checking the presence of a table, returning `True` if the table is found and `False` otherwise.
3. This revised logic should fix the bug and ensure that the function behaves correctly, passing the failing tests.
