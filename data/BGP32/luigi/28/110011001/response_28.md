### Bug Analysis
The bug seems to be related to the comparison logic in the `table_exists` function. In the provided implementation, the function checks if the stdout contains the table name using the `table in stdout` condition. However, this check is failing in the cases where the table name is present in the stdout output.

The problem arises from the fact that the function is checking whether the full table name is present in the `stdout` string. In one of the failing test cases, the `stdout` value is `'OK\nmytable'` which does contain the table name `mytable`, but the comparison fails because the condition `table in stdout` is not matching the full table name with the `stdout` content.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to update the comparison logic in the `table_exists` function to correctly check if the table name is present in the `stdout` output. We can split the `stdout` by newlines and then check if the table name is present in any of those lines.

### Corrected Version
```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
            return stdout and table in stdout.split('\n')
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                                (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
            
            return bool(stdout)
```

By splitting the `stdout` string by newlines and checking if the table name is present in any of those lines, the corrected version of the function should now correctly identify if a table exists based on the output from the hive command. This fix should address the issue with the failed test cases.
