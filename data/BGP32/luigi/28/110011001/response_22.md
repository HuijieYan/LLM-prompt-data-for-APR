### Analysis
The buggy function `table_exists` is failing the tests because it is not handling the case-insensitive comparison of table names correctly. The function is comparing the table names without considering the case, leading to incorrect results.

### Bug
The bug lies in the comparison of the table name in the `table_exists` function. The function checks if the `table` exists in the `stdout` output from the `run_hive_cmd` function, but it does a case-sensitive comparison which causes the tests to fail when the case of the table name is different.

### Fix
To fix the bug, we need to perform a case-insensitive comparison of the table names. We can achieve this by converting both the `table` and the names in `stdout` to lowercase before comparison.

### Corrected Version
```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
    
            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                                (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
    
            return bool(stdout)
``` 

By converting both `table` and the names in `stdout` to lowercase before comparison, we ensure a case-insensitive comparison, which will fix the bug and make the function pass the failing tests.
