### Analysis:
The issue in the `table_exists` function arises from the comparison of the `table` variable with the result stored in `stdout`. The comparison is currently checking if `table in stdout`, which will return `False` if the `table` name is found preceded by a newline character (`\n`) in the `stdout` result.

### Bug:
The bug occurs because the function does not properly handle cases where the table name retrieved from `stdout` is followed by a newline character.

### Fix:
To fix the bug, we need to strip the `stdout` variable to remove any leading or trailing whitespace. This will ensure that the comparison with the `table` variable is accurate.

### Corrected Version:
```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
    
            return stdout and table in stdout.strip()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                                (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
    
            return bool(stdout)
``` 

By stripping the `stdout` variable in the comparison, we ensure that the function returns the correct result based on the existence of the table in the database.
