### Bug Explanation
The bug in the `table_exists` function occurs because the condition to check if the table exists is evaluating incorrectly. In the first part of the function, the condition `return stdout and table in stdout` is not checking if the table is present in the list of tables returned by the `show tables` command. Instead, it's checking if the variable `stdout` is not empty and if `table` is in `stdout` as a whole string.

In the second part of the function, the `show partitions` command is used to check table existence with partitions. However, the condition checking if `stdout` is not empty is not enough to determine if the table exists with partitions.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to change the conditions in both parts of the function to properly check for the existence of the table in the output of the Hive commands. We should also handle the case-insensitivity of table names to match the test cases.

### Corrected Version of the Function

```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables'.format(database))
            tables = stdout.split('\n')
            return any(t.lower() == table.lower() for t in tables)
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use {0}; show partitions {1} partition
                                ({2})""".format(database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
            return bool(stdout)
```

By splitting the output of the `show tables` command and checking if the table exists in the list with case-insensitive comparison, we can correctly determine table existence. Additionally, the partition existence check is simplified by just checking if the output is not empty. This corrected version should pass the failing tests.
