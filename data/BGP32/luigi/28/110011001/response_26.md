### Explanation:
The bug in the `table_exists` function lies in the condition checks for whether the `table` exists in the `stdout` output. In the first part of the function, when `partition` is `None`, the function tries to find the table by checking if `table in stdout`. However, the way it's currently implemented does not handle cases where the table name might be included within other words in the `stdout`.

In the second part, when a `partition` is provided, the function attempts to find the table using a different command but fails to account for cases where the table might not exist in the specified partition.

### Strategy for fixing the bug:
1. Implement more robust table name checks in the `stdout` output to ensure accurate identification of table existence.
2. Handle partitioned table checks properly, checking if the table is part of the specified partition before returning the result.

### Corrected version of the function:

```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

            tables = stdout.split('\n')
            return any(t.strip().lower() == table.lower() for t in tables)
        else:
            partition_spec = self.partition_spec(partition)
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use {0}; show partitions {1} partition ({2})""".format(database, table, partition_spec))

            partitions = stdout.split('\n')
            return any(p.strip().lower() == partition_spec.lower() for p in partitions)
```

This corrected version splits the `stdout` output into lines and then checks if any of the tables/partitions match the specified table/partition. The comparison is done after converting both strings to lowercase to ignore case sensitivity. This approach should resolve the bug and pass the failing tests.
