To fix the bug in the `table_exists` function, we need to address the case sensitivity when comparing the table name to the output from the Hive command. As shown in the failing test cases, the table names might have different cases than what is returned from the Hive command, leading to assertion failures.

Here's the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
from luigi.contrib.hive import run_hive_cmd

class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    def partition_spec(self, partition):
        # Please ignore the body of this function

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

            if stdout:
                return table.lower() in stdout.lower()
            else:
                return False
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("use {0}; show partitions {1} partition {2};".format(database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

            if stdout:
                return True
            else:
                return False
```

In the corrected version:
- We ensure that both the table name and the stdout are converted to lower case before comparison to make the check case insensitive.
- The modified logic should now pass the failing test cases mentioned, considering the case sensitivity of table names in comparison to the Hive command output.

By making these adjustments, the `table_exists` function should now correctly handle case sensitivity issues and pass the failing tests, resolving the bug reported in GitHub issues #896.
