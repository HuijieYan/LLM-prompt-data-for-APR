To fix the bug in the `table_exists` function, we need to ensure that we handle the case sensitivity issue correctly. The function needs to compare the table name in a case-insensitive manner to the tables listed in the `stdout`.

Here's the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
        return stdout and table.lower() in map(str.lower, stdout.split())

    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                        (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        return bool(stdout)
```

Explanation of changes:
- In the initial `if` block, lowercase the input `table` parameter and then check if it is present in the `stdout` after splitting it by space as lowercased as well.
- Removed the unnecessary check for `stdout` existence in the else block as the function should directly return a boolean based on the presence of `stdout`.

By making these changes, the function now correctly handles the case insensitivity issues and should pass the failing tests. This adjustment aligns with the solution proposed in the GitHub issue #896 and reflects the error in the original implementation.
