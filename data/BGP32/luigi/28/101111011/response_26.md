The bug in the `table_exists` function arises from the fact that it directly compares the table name with the output from the Hive command without considering case sensitivity. This leads to test failures when the case of the table name does not match the case of the output string from the Hive command.

The solution to this bug is to make the comparison case-insensitive by converting both the table name and the output string to lowercase before the comparison.

Here is the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    
    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
            
            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                                (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
            
            if stdout:
                return True
            else:
                return False
```

This corrected version ensures that both the table name and the output string from the Hive command are compared in a case-insensitive manner.

By implementing this change, the `table_exists` function should now pass the failing tests and resolve the reported GitHub issue.
