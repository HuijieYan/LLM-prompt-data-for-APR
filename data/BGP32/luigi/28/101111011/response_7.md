### Identified Bug:
The bug in the `table_exists` function arises from a case sensitivity issue when comparing the table name extracted from the Hive command output (`stdout`) with the input table name. Since Hive is case insensitive, the comparison leads to failures when there are differences in case between the input and the extracted table name.

### Bug Cause:
The buggy function compares the table name directly from `stdout` with the input table name in `table_exists`. The test cases are failing because the comparisons are case sensitive, causing inconsistencies due to the case insensitivity of Hive.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To address the bug, we should convert both the extracted table name from `stdout` and the input table name to lowercase before comparing them. This will ensure that the comparison is case insensitive, aligning with the behavior of Hive.

### Corrected Version of the `table_exists` Function:
```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

By converting both the table names to lowercase before comparison, we ensure that the `table_exists` function is case insensitive and the bug is resolved. This corrected version should make the failing test cases pass and align with the fix proposed in the GitHub issue.
