To fix the bug in the `table_exists` function, we need to make the comparison case insensitive. Currently, the function is directly comparing the table name with the stdout from the `run_hive_cmd` function, leading to failures when the case of the table name and stdout doesn't match due to Hive being case insensitive.

Here is the corrected version of the `table_exists` function with case insensitivity:

```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: luigi/contrib/hive.py

# This function from the same file, but not the same class, is called by the buggy function
def run_hive_cmd(hivecmd, check_return_code=True):
    # Please ignore the body of this function

# The declaration of the class containing the buggy function
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    # This function from the same class is called by the buggy function
    def partition_spec(self, partition):
        # Please ignore the body of this function



    # this is the buggy function you need to fix
    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
    
            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                                (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
    
            if stdout:
                return True
            else:
                return False
    
```

By using `table.lower()` and `stdout.lower()` for comparison, we ensure that the comparison is case insensitive, allowing the function to match the table existence correctly even if the cases differ.

This correction aligns with the suggested strategy in the GitHub issue to make the `table_exists` function case insensitive.

This corrected version should now pass the failing tests provided in the `hive_test.py` file and address the issue reported on GitHub related to case insensitivity in table existence checks.
