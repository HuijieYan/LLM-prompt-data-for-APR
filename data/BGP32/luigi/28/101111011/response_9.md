## Analysis
The buggy function `table_exists` is failing because it's not handling case insensitivity correctly when comparing the table names extracted from the `stdout`. The issue arises due to the fact that Hive returns table names in lowercase, causing a mismatch when comparing them with the original table name (which might be capitalized).

In the failing test cases, the buggy function either returns `False` when it should be `True` or vice versa due to the case sensitivity issue. This results in failing assertions in the test cases.

## Bug Explanation
The bug in the `table_exists` function stems from the comparison between the table names. The function extracts the table names from `stdout` but fails to account for case differences between the input table name and the returned table names. This leads to incorrect evaluations and mismatches.

## Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to modify the comparison logic to be case insensitive. One way to achieve this is by converting both the input table name and the extracted table names to lowercase before comparing them. This adjustment will ensure that the comparisons are accurate regardless of the case.

## Corrected Version of the Function
```python
# Fix the case sensitivity issue in table_exists function
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
        
        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
        
        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

By converting both `table` and the extracted table names to lowercase before comparison, the corrected version of the function ensures that case sensitivity is no longer an issue. This modification will enable the function to pass the failing test cases and resolve the GitHub issue related to case insensitivity in `table_exists`.
