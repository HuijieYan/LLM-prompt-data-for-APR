To fix the bug in the `table_exists` function, we need to make the comparison case insensitive by converting both the table name and the output to lower case before comparing them. This will ensure that the function works correctly regardless of the case sensitivity of the table names.

Here is the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
# The corrected version of the buggy function
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

By converting both the `table` and the `stdout` to lower case before comparing them, we ensure that the function correctly handles case insensitivity. This change aligns with the suggestions in the GitHub issue and resolves the failing tests due to case sensitivity issues.

After applying this fix, the tests for the `table_exists` function should pass without any assertion errors. The correction addresses the root cause of the bug related to case sensitivity in table name comparisons in the function.
