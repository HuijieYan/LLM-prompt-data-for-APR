### Identified Bug:
The bug in the `table_exists` function lies in the comparison between the table name and the tables listed in the output of `run_hive_cmd`. The comparison is case-sensitive, causing failures in tests where table names are provided with different cases.

### Explanation of the Bug:
1. In the failing test, when `table_exists` is called with the table name `"MyTable"`, the function checks for an exact match in the `stdout` returned by `run_hive_cmd`. Since `run_hive_cmd` returns a string with lowercase table names, the comparison fails leading to the assertion error.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. To fix the bug and make the comparison case-insensitive, both the table name and the `stdout` string should be converted to lowercase before comparing.
2. By ensuring that both strings are in the same case (lowercase), the function will correctly identify table existence regardless of the case provided in the function call.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
# Corrected version of the buggy function
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

In the corrected version above, `table.lower()` is used to convert the table name to lowercase before comparing, and similarly, `stdout.lower()` is used to convert the `stdout` string to lowercase for a case-insensitive comparison.

By making these changes, the `table_exists` function should now pass the failing tests and correctly handle case-sensitive comparisons related to table existence in Hive.
