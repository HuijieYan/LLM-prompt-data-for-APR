To fix the bug in the `table_exists` function, we need to address the case sensitivity when checking if a table exists in Hive. The bug arises because the comparison between the table name and the tables listed in the `stdout` is case sensitive.

Here's the corrected version of the `table_exists` function with modifications for case insensitivity:

```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    def partition_spec(self, partition):
        # Please ignore the body of this function

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables;'.format(database))
            return stdout and table.lower() in map(str.lower, stdout.split('\n'))
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
            if stdout:
                return True
            else:
                return False
```

Explanation of corrections:
1. Changed the query to `show tables;` to get all table names from the database.
2. Converted `table` and the element in `stdout` to lowercase to perform a case-insensitive comparison.

With these modifications, the function should now handle case sensitivity issues when checking for table existence in Hive. This change aligns with the proposed solution in the GitHub issue to make the `table_exists` function case insensitive.

After applying these changes, run the failing tests to ensure that the corrected function passes all the test cases.
