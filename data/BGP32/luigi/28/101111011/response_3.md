To fix the bug in the `table_exists` function, we need to ensure that the comparison between the table name and the tables listed in the Hive output is case insensitive. Currently, the function directly checks if the table name is in the stdout, which can lead to case-sensitivity issues.

Here is the corrected version of the `table_exists` function with a case-insensitive comparison:

```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                                (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
            return bool(stdout)
```

In this corrected version:
1. We convert both the `table` name and the tables listed in `stdout` to lowercase using `table.lower()` and `stdout.lower()` before the comparison.
2. We return `bool(stdout)` directly in the else block instead of checking for True or False conditions.

With this revision, the `table_exists` function should now correctly handle case-insensitive comparisons between the table name and the tables listed in the Hive output. This modification should resolve the failing test cases and address the GitHub issue regarding case sensitivity in table existence checks.
