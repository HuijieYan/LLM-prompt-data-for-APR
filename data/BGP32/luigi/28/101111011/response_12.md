The bug in the `table_exists` function stems from a case sensitivity issue where the function does not handle different cases of table names correctly, causing the tests to fail. The function should compare the lowercase version of the table name with the lowercase version of the stdout to make the comparison case-insensitive.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug in the `table_exists` function, ensure that the comparison between the table name and the stdout is case-insensitive by converting both to lowercase before checking for existence.

### Corrected Version of the `table_exists` function:
```python
# The corrected version of the buggy function
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

With this corrected version, the `table_exists` function will now perform a case-insensitive comparison between the table name and the stdout, allowing it to correctly detect the existence of tables regardless of the case.

By applying this fix, the function should pass the failing tests provided and address the GitHub issue where the case sensitivity problem was reported.
