To fix the bug in the `table_exists` function, we need to make the comparison case-insensitive. The root cause of the failing tests is that the function compares the table name directly with the output from Hive without considering case sensitivity.

Here is the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
   
    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

            if stdout:
                return True
            else:
                return False
```

By converting both `table` and `stdout` to lowercase before comparison, we ensure a case-insensitive match. This modification aligns with the proposed solution in the GitHub issue. This corrected version should now pass the failing test cases and address the issue of case sensitivity.

Make sure to test the updated function to confirm that it resolves the bug as intended.
