To fix the bug in the `table_exists` function, we need to make the comparison case-insensitive by converting both the table name and the stdout to lowercase before checking. This will align with the request in the GitHub issue and ensure that the comparison works regardless of the case of the table name.

Here is the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
# The corrected version of the buggy function

def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

By converting both `table` and `stdout` to lowercase before comparison, we ensure that the function is case-insensitive. This change will address the failing tests and align with the request in the GitHub issue to make the `table_exists` function case-insensitive.

This corrected version should now pass the failing tests and resolve the issue reported in GitHub.
