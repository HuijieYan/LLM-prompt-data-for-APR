### Identified Bug:
The bug in the `table_exists` function is related to case sensitivity. The function does not handle case insensitivity when checking if a table exists in the database, leading to test failures when the table name casing does not match.

### Cause of the Bug:
The bug occurs because the comparison between the table name and the table names in the `stdout` output is case-sensitive. When the table name case does not match exactly, the function wrongly determines the table's existence.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to make the comparison case-insensitive by converting both the table name and the table names in the `stdout` to lowercase before the comparison.

### Corrected Version of the `table_exists` Function:
Here is the corrected version of the `table_exists` function that addresses the case sensitivity issue:
```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        return bool(stdout)
```

By converting both the table name (`table`) and the table names in `stdout` to lowercase before comparison, the function is now case-insensitive, fixing the bug.
