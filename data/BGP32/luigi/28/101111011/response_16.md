To fix the bug in the `table_exists` function, we need to address the case sensitivity issue highlighted in the failing test and the GitHub issue. The problem arises when comparing the table name from the function input with the tables listed in the `stdout`, which may be in a different case due to Hive's case insensitivity. We need to ensure that the comparison is done in a case-insensitive manner.

Here is the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in map(str.lower, stdout.split())
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        return bool(stdout)
```

Explanation of the changes:
1. We modified the comparison in the return statement to convert both the `table` name and the table names in `stdout` to lowercase using `table.lower()` and `map(str.lower, stdout.split())`. This ensures a case-insensitive comparison.
2. We simplified the check for the presence of `stdout` by returning `bool(stdout)` directly, as an empty string will evaluate to `False` and any content to `True`.

With these changes, the `table_exists` function should now pass the failing test cases and address the case insensitivity issue mentioned in the GitHub issue.

Feel free to test this corrected version and check if it resolves the problem with the failing tests.
