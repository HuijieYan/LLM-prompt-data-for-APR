To fix the bug in the `table_exists` function, we need to make the comparison case insensitive by converting both the table name and the output from `run_hive_cmd` to lowercase before checking for a match. This will ensure that the function works correctly irrespective of the case of the table name.

Here is the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: luigi/contrib/hive.py

def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                        (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

This correction will enable the function to correctly handle cases where the table names are different in terms of capitalization. By converting both the table name and the output from `run_hive_cmd` to lowercase, we ensure a case-insensitive comparison, resolving the issue with the failing tests as reported in the provided GitHub issues.
