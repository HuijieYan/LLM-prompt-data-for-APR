Based on the provided information, the buggy function `table_exists` fails to properly handle case sensitivity when checking for the existence of a table. To fix this bug and make the function case insensitive, the existing table name should be converted to lowercase before comparison with the output from `run_hive_cmd`.

Here is the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
# The corrected version of the buggy function
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        partition_str = self.partition_spec(partition)
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition (%s)""" % (database, table, partition_str))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

In this corrected version, both `table` and `stdout` are converted to lowercase using the `lower()` method before comparison to ensure case insensitivity when checking for the table's existence.

By implementing this change, the `table_exists` function will now correctly handle case sensitivity issues and pass the failing tests, thus resolving the problem reported in GitHub issues #896 and the related issue.
