## Analysis:
1. The buggy function `table_exists` checks for the existence of a table in Hive. The issue arises from the comparison of table names in a case-sensitive manner.
2. The failing test functions provide cases where the table names have different cases, leading to the assertion errors during comparison.
3. The error is caused by not considering the case sensitivity of table names in the given Hive environment.
4. To fix the bug, we need to convert the table name to a consistent case before comparison in the function `table_exists`.
5. We should modify the comparison to be case-insensitive by converting both the table name and the retrieved table names from Hive to lowercase for comparison.

## Bug Fix:

```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                                (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

            if stdout:
                return True
            else:
                return False
```

By converting both the table name and the retrieved table names to lowercase before comparison, we ensure that the comparison is case-insensitive. This fix should resolve the failing test cases and address the issue reported on GitHub.
