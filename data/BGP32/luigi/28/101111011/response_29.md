### Identified Bug:
The bug in the `table_exists` function is due to case sensitivity when comparing the table name against the output from the Hive command. The function doesn't handle the case where table names might be in different cases - capitalized or not. This leads to failing tests when the table names are not matching case-wise causing assertions to fail.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is caused by a mismatch in the case of table names when comparing `table` with the output `stdout`. Since Hive is case-insensitive, the function should account for this by converting both the `table` and the output to lowercase before comparison.

### Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that both the `table` name and the `stdout` output are in the same case before comparison to make the function case-insensitive.

### Corrected Version:
```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

            if stdout:
                return True
            else:
                return False
```

With this correction, the `table_exists` function now converts both the `table` and the `stdout` to lowercase before comparison, ensuring case insensitivity. This should resolve the failing test cases and align with the proposed fix in the GitHub issue #896.
