### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `table_exists` in the `HiveCommandClient` class in the `luigi.contrib.hive` file is supposed to check if a table exists in a database by invoking the `run_hive_cmd` function.
2. The bug arises from the comparison between the table name and the output from `run_hive_cmd`, which is case sensitive, leading to test failures.
3. The GitHub issue highlights the need for case insensitivity in checking table existence due to Hive being case insensitive.
4. The bug can be fixed by converting both the table name and the stdout to lowercase for a case-insensitive comparison.

### Bug Fix:
```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

By converting both `table` and `stdout` to lowercase before comparing them, the bug is fixed to make the `table_exists` function case insensitive.
