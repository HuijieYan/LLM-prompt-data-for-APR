The buggy function `table_exists` has a bug where it does not handle case sensitivity correctly when checking if a table exists in Hive. This leads to failing tests as demonstrated in the provided test case. The typical issue arises when comparing the table name against the output of the Hive command, which may have a different case.

To fix this bug, the `table_exists` function should convert both the table name and the output from Hive command to lowercase for a case-insensitive comparison. This modification will ensure that the function can correctly detect the existence of a table regardless of the case used.

Below is the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
        else:
            partition_spec = self.partition_spec(partition)
            stdout = run_hive_cmd(f"use {database}; show partitions {table} partition ({partition_spec})")

            return bool(stdout)
```

By converting both the `table` and the `stdout` to lowercase before comparing, the bug related to case sensitivity should be resolved. This correction aligns with the suggested fix in the GitHub issue for this bug, which recommended checking `table.lower() in stdout.lower()` to handle case-insensitive comparisons. Now, the corrected function should pass the failing test case and address the reported issue.
