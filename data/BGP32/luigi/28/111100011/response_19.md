The buggy function `table_exists` has an issue where it does not handle case sensitivity when checking for table existence in Hive. The function compares the table name directly without considering case sensitivity, which leads to failures in tests where the table name casing does not match.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the comparison logic to be case insensitive by converting both the table name and the stdout to lower case before comparison.

Here is the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

With this modification, the function will compare the tables in a case-insensitive manner, thereby passing the failing test described in the GitHub issue.
