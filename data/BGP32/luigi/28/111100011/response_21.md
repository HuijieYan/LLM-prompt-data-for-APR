### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `table_exists` in the `HiveCommandClient` class is checking for the existence of a table in Hive, but it is not handling case sensitivity correctly.
2. The issue arises when the table names are provided in a different case than what is returned by Hive, leading to test failures.
3. The failing test in `hive_test.py` is specifically testing for case sensitivity in table existence checks.
4. The suggested fix in the GitHub issue is to make the `table_exists` function case insensitive by comparing table names in lowercase.
Based on the analysis, we need to modify the `table_exists` function to compare table names in a case-insensitive manner when checking for existence in Hive.

### Bug Fix:
```python
# Updated/Corrected version of the buggy function
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

By converting both the table name and the `stdout` output to lowercase before comparison, the bug related to case sensitivity when checking table existence in Hive is addressed. This correction should resolve the failing test case as well as the GitHub issue regarding table existence being case sensitive in the `table_exists` function.
