# The bug in the provided function is related to case sensitivity when checking for table existence in Hive.

## Analysis:
1. The `table_exists` function in the `HiveCommandClient` class is supposed to check if a table exists in a Hive database. However, the current implementation is case sensitive, leading to failures when comparing table names with different cases.
2. The failing test case in `hive_test.py` tests for this case sensitivity issue by checking different variations of table names.

## Bug Cause:
The bug occurs because the `table_exists` function compares the table name directly with the tables listed in the output from Hive queries without considering case sensitivity. This results in false negatives when the case of the table name does not match the case in the output.

## Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, the comparison between the table name and the tables listed in the Hive output should be case insensitive. This can be achieved by converting both the table name and the tables in the output to lowercase before comparison.

## Corrected Version of the Function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        return bool(stdout)
```

In the corrected version:
1. The `table` and `stdout` values are converted to lowercase using the `lower()` function before comparing for case insensitivity.
2. The return statement is simplified to return a boolean value based on whether `stdout` is not empty.

By making these changes, the `table_exists` function will be case insensitive when checking for the existence of tables in Hive, resolving the bug identified in the GitHub issue.

This corrected version should pass the failing test cases and address the case sensitivity issue reported on GitHub.
