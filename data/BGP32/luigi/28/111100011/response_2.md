The buggy function `table_exists` is failing the test cases because it does not account for case sensitivity when checking if a table exists in the Hive database. The bug is related to the fact that Hive is case insensitive when returning table names, causing the test to fail when checking for table existence.

To fix this bug, the function should convert both the table name and the returned table names to lowercase for comparison. By doing so, we ensure that the comparison is case insensitive, resolving the failing test cases.

Here is the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
# The relative path of the fixed file: luigi/contrib/hive.py

class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
    
            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                                (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
    
            if stdout:
                return True
            else:
                return False
```

By converting both the `table` and returned values to lowercase for comparison, the corrected function ensures case insensitivity when checking for table existence in Hive. This modification aligns with the suggested solution in the GitHub issue and addresses the failing test cases for the `table_exists` function.
