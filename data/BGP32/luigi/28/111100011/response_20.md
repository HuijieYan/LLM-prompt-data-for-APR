## Analyzing the buggy function and related components:

1. **Buggy Function (`table_exists`):**
    - The `table_exists` function in the `HiveCommandClient` class checks if a table exists in Hive.
    - It uses the `run_hive_cmd` function to execute Hive commands and get the output.
    - When a partition is specified, it uses the `partition_spec` function to generate the partition specs.

2. **Related Functions:**
    - `run_hive_cmd`: Calls external Hive commands and returns the output.
    - `partition_spec`: Generates partition specs based on the input.

3. **Failing Test (`test_table_exists`):**
    - The test checks the behavior of the `table_exists` function with different inputs and assertions.
    - It includes cases for checking table existence with and without partitions.

4. **GitHub Issue:**
    - The issue discusses the problem of case-insensitivity when checking table existence in Hive.
    - The proposed fix is to compare the table name in a case-insensitive manner.

## Identifying the Bug:
The bug arises because the comparison between the table name and the output from Hive is case-sensitive. Hive returns table names in lowercase, causing the comparison to fail for tables with different cases.

## Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to convert both the table name and the output from Hive to lowercase before comparison. This will make the comparison case-insensitive and address the issue raised in the GitHub discussion.

## Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                          (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

By converting both the table name and the output to lowercase before comparison, the corrected function will now perform a case-insensitive check for table existence in Hive, addressing the bug and passing the failing test cases.
