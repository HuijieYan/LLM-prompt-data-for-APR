#### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `table_exists` in the `HiveCommandClient` class is checking for table existence in a case-sensitive manner, leading to test failures.
2. The issue from GitHub points out that the table existence check should be case-insensitive to handle scenarios where table names are in different cases.
3. The bug arises because the function did not handle case sensitivity in table names when comparing with the output from the `run_hive_cmd` function. This causes the test cases to fail when table names are uppercase or mixed case.
4. To fix the bug, we need to modify the comparison logic in the `table_exists` function to make it case-insensitive when checking for table existence.

#### Solution:
Here is the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                        (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

By converting both the `table` and the `stdout` to lowercase before comparison, the function will now be able to handle case-insensitive table existence checks, as suggested in the GitHub issue.

This corrected version should resolve the bug and make the `table_exists` function case-insensitive, passing the failing test case.
