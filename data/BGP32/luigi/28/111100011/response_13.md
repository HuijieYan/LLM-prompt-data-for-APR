### Analysis:
The buggy function `table_exists` in the `HiveCommandClient` class of the `luigi.contrib.hive` module is supposed to check if a table exists using Hive commands. The bug is related to case sensitivity while comparing table names.

The failing test `test_table_exists` in `hive_test.py` shows that the table name comparison is case sensitive, causing the test to fail when the table names are in different cases.

The GitHub issues #896 and #885 highlight the problem of case sensitivity in the `table_exists` function and suggest making the comparison case insensitive.

### Bug Location:
The bug in the `table_exists` function occurs when comparing the table name with the table names in the output of the Hive command.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is caused by a case-sensitive comparison between the provided `table` name and the table names fetched from `stdout`. Hive is case-insensitive, so the comparison should also be case-insensitive to handle all scenarios correctly.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to convert both the `table` name and the table names extracted from `stdout` to lowercase before comparison. This will make the comparison case-insensitive and resolve the failing test.

### Corrected Version:
```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

            if stdout:
                return True
            else:
                return False
```

By converting both the `table` name and the names from `stdout` to lowercase before comparison, the corrected version of the `table_exists` function will now handle case sensitivity issues and pass the failing test.
