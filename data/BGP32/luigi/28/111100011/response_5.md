### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `table_exists` in the `HiveCommandClient` class is checking for table existence by directly comparing the table name with the output received from the `run_hive_cmd` function.
2. The issue identified in the GitHub reports a case sensitivity problem when checking for table existence due to the fact that Hive is case insensitive, causing the test to fail when tables are named differently in terms of case.
3. The bug occurs because there is a direct comparison between the table name and the output without considering case sensitivity.
4. To fix the bug, we need to convert both the table name and the output to lowercase before comparison. This will ensure case insensitivity in the table existence check.

### Corrected Version:
```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """
    
    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                                (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
            if stdout:
                return True
            else:
                return False
```

By converting both the table name and the output to lowercase before comparison using `table.lower() in stdout.lower()`, the corrected version ensures that the table existence check is case insensitive, resolving the bug reported in the GitHub issue.

This corrected version should pass the failing test included in the GitHub issue and address the case sensitivity problem in checking table existence in Hive.
