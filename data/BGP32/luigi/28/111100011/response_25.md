## Analyzing the buggy function and related test code:

- The buggy function `table_exists` within the `HiveCommandClient` class checks for the existence of a table in a Hive database.
- The function calls `run_hive_cmd` to execute Hive commands.
- The failing test `test_table_exists` aims to test the functionality of the `table_exists` function.
- The test includes scenarios where the table names are provided in different cases to evaluate the case sensitivity issue.

## Identified potential error locations within the buggy function:
1. In the `if partition is None` branch, the comparison between `table` and `stdout` may fail due to case sensitivity.
2. In the `else` branch, the comparison of `stdout` with an expected value might also be affected by case sensitivity.

## Explanation of the bug:
- The bug arises due to the case sensitivity of the comparisons done in the `table_exists` function.
- Hive returns table names in lowercase, causing the function to incorrectly check for table existence based on case-sensitive comparisons.
- The failing test cases highlight this issue by showing failures when comparing differently cased table names.

## Strategy for fixing the bug:
- To fix this bug and make the `table_exists` function case insensitive, modify the comparisons to compare lowercase versions of the table name and the output from Hive.
- By converting both the table name and the output to lowercase before comparison, the function can accurately determine table existence irrespective of case.

## Corrected version of the `table_exists` function:
```python
    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
    
            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                                (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
    
            return bool(stdout)
```

In the corrected version:
- Both `table` and `stdout` are converted to lowercase for case-insensitive comparison.
- The unnecessary `if stdout` check is removed in the `else` branch to simplify the code.

By making these changes, the `table_exists` function will now correctly handle case insensitivity when checking for table existence in Hive.

This correction addresses the issue reported in GitHub and ensures that the function behaves as expected in scenarios with differently cased table names.
