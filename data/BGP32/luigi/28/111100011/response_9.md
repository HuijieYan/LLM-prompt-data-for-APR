### Analysis
The buggy function `table_exists` in the `HiveCommandClient` class is responsible for checking whether a table exists in a specified database. The issue arises when the table name case sensitivity is not considered in the comparison. This leads to failing tests related to table existence checks.

The failing test `test_table_exists` highlights the problem by showing that the function does not handle case sensitivity correctly when comparing table names.

The GitHub issue indicates that the `table_exists` function should be case insensitive to align with how Hive handles table names and prevent test failures due to case differences.

### Bug Explanation
The bug in the `table_exists` function stems from not accounting for case sensitivity when comparing the table name provided with the tables retrieved from Hive. Since Hive is case insensitive, the function should perform a case-insensitive comparison to check if the table exists.

The failing test demonstrates this issue by testing various scenarios where the table names differ in case, and the function fails to return the correct result.

### Strategy for Bug Fix
To fix the bug, the `table_exists` function needs to modify the comparison of table names retrieved from Hive to be case insensitive. This can be achieved by converting both the provided table name and the tables in the output to lowercase before the comparison.

### Corrected Version of the Function
```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

            if stdout:
                return True
            else:
                return False
```

In the corrected version, both the provided table name (`table.lower()`) and the tables in the output (`stdout.lower()`) are converted to lowercase for a case-insensitive comparison. This change aligns with the expected behavior based on the GitHub issue discussion and resolves the failing test cases.
