### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `table_exists` in the `HiveCommandClient` class is checking for the existence of a table in Hive by running a Hive command and comparing the output with the provided table name.
2. The bug seems to be related to case sensitivity when comparing the table name in the output from Hive.
3. The failing test `test_table_exists` in `hive_test.py` tries to check if the table exists in both lowercase and uppercase formats, highlighting the case sensitivity issue.
4. The GitHub issue points out that Hive is case insensitive, so the function should also be case insensitive when checking for table existence.
5. The fix involves converting both the table name and the output from Hive to lowercase for a case-insensitive comparison.

### Bug Cause:
The buggy function `table_exists` compares the provided table name directly with the output from Hive without considering case sensitivity. This causes the comparison to fail when the case of the table name is different from the returned output from Hive.

### Fix Strategy:
1. Modify the `table_exists` function to convert both the table name and the output from Hive to lowercase before performing the comparison.
2. Use lower() method to convert the strings to lowercase before checking for table existence. This will make the comparison case insensitive.

### Corrected Version:
```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
    
            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                                (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
    
            if stdout:
                return True
            else:
                return False
```

After making these changes, the corrected version of the `table_exists` function should pass the failing test mentioned in `hive_test.py` and address the issue reported on GitHub regarding case insensitivity.
