## Analysis:
1. The `table_exists` function in the `HiveCommandClient` class is designed to check if a table exists in Hive, but there is a case sensitivity issue causing the test cases to fail.
2. The function uses the `run_hive_cmd` function to execute Hive commands.
3. The issue reported on GitHub highlights that the function should be case insensitive as Hive is case insensitive and returns table names in lowercase.
4. To fix the bug, we need to modify the comparison between the table name and the output from Hive to be case insensitive.

## Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Modify the comparison between the table name and the output from Hive to use case-insensitive comparison.
2. Convert both the table name and the output to lowercase before comparing.

## Corrected Version:
```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    
    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                                (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
            
            if stdout:
                return True
            else:
                return False
```

By converting both the table name and the output from Hive to lowercase before comparison, the corrected function now performs a case-insensitive check for the existence of the table. This fix addresses the issue reported on GitHub and should make the test cases pass successfully.
