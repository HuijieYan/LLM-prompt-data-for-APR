### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `table_exists` in the `HiveCommandClient` class in `luigi.contrib.hive.py` is not handling case sensitivity properly when checking if a table exists in Hive.
2. The failing test in `hive_test.py` checks for case sensitivity in table names.
3. The GitHub issue #896 highlights the need to make `table_exists` case insensitive to avoid issues where table names are in different cases.
4. The bug is caused by not converting both the table name and the output from Hive to lowercase before comparison.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to modify the `table_exists` function to ensure that both the table name and the output from Hive are converted to lowercase for case-insensitive comparison.

### Corrected Function:
```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                        (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

By converting both `table` and `stdout` to lowercase before comparison in the `table_exists` function, we make the check case insensitive, which resolves the issue raised in the failing test and the GitHub issue.
