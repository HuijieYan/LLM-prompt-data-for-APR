### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `table_exists` in the `HiveCommandClient` class of `luigi/contrib/hive.py` is responsible for checking if a table exists in a database using Hive commands.
2. The function uses the `run_hive_cmd` function to execute Hive commands and check the output against the specified table name for existence.
3. The buggy function fails to account for case sensitivity issues, as reported in GitHub issues #896 and the related tests in `hive_test.py`.
4. To fix the bug, the function should compare the lowercase version of the table name with the lowercase version of the output from Hive commands to ensure case insensitivity.

### Bug Cause:
The bug arises from the buggy function `table_exists` not considering case sensitivity when checking for table existence in the database. If the table name and the output from Hive commands differ only in case, the function fails to detect the table's existence.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, modify the `table_exists` function to convert the table name and the output from Hive commands to lowercase before comparison. This ensures that the function correctly identifies table existence regardless of case differences.

### Corrected Function:
```python
# The corrected version of the buggy function

class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """
    
    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
    
            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                                (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
    
            return bool(stdout)
```

By converting both the table name and Hive command output to lowercase before comparison, the corrected version of the `table_exists` function ensures case-insensitive table existence checks, resolving the bug reported in the GitHub issues.
