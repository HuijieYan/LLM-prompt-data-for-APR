### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `table_exists` in the `HiveCommandClient` class from `luigi/contrib/hive.py` is responsible for checking if a table exists in a given database. It uses the `run_hive_cmd` function to execute Hive commands.
2. The bug identified is related to case sensitivity when checking for table existence. The function does not handle case insensitivity properly, leading to test failures when tables are in different case formats.
3. The failing test case `test_table_exists` in `hive_test.py` highlights the issue by testing the function with tables in different cases, expecting the function to be case insensitive when checking for table existence.
4. To fix the bug, we need to modify the `table_exists` function to compare the lowercase version of the table name with the lowercase version of the output from Hive, ensuring a case-insensitive check.
5. The corrected version of the `table_exists` function is as follows:

### Corrected Version:
```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

By comparing the lowercase versions of the table name and the output from Hive in a case-insensitive manner, the corrected version of the `table_exists` function resolves the issue raised in the GitHub reports and ensures proper table existence checks.
