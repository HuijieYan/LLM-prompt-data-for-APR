### Analysis:
1. The function `table_exists` in the `HiveCommandClient` class is responsible for checking if a specified table exists in the Hive database.
2. The bug occurs due to case sensitivity issues, where the function fails to correctly identify a table if the case of the table name does not match the case in the database.
3. The failing test case also highlights the problem by showing that the function does not handle case sensitivity properly.
4. The GitHub issues emphasize the need to make the `table_exists` function case insensitive to address this problem.
5. A strategy to fix the bug involves converting both the table name and the output from the Hive command to lowercase for comparison.

### Bug Fix:
```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

            return stdout.lower() and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

            return True if stdout else False
```

In the corrected version, both the `table` and `stdout` are converted to lowercase before comparison to ensure case insensitivity. This fix addresses the bug reported in the failing test case and the GitHub issues related to case sensitivity in the `table_exists` function.
