### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `table_exists` is part of the `HiveCommandClient` class in the `luigi.contrib.hive.py` file.
2. The function calls the `run_hive_cmd` function to execute Hive commands and check for the existence of a table.
3. The failing test `test_table_exists` in the `hive_test.py` file checks the behavior of the `table_exists` function for case sensitivity issues.
4. The GitHub issue highlights the case sensitivity problem when checking for table existence in Hive and suggests the solution of comparing table names in lowercase to avoid issues.

### Identified Potential Error:
The buggy function in the `table_exists` method compares the table name without considering case sensitivity, which leads to test failures.

### Bug Explanation:
The bug occurs because the `table_exists` function does not handle case sensitivity when comparing the table name with the output from Hive commands. This inconsistency leads to the test failures due to different case representations of table names.

### Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to convert both the table name and the command output to lowercase before comparison. This way, we can ensure case insensitivity and resolve the failing test cases.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

By converting both the table name and the output to lowercase before comparison, the corrected version of the `table_exists` function ensures case insensitivity when checking for table existence in Hive commands.
