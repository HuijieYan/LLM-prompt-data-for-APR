Based on the buggy function, failing test, and the GitHub issues provided, the bug in the `table_exists` function is due to a case sensitivity issue. The `table_exists` function compares the table name from the input with the output received from Hive without considering case sensitivity, leading to test failures when the case of the table name does not match. The proposed fix is to make the comparison case insensitive.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the comparison in the `table_exists` function to be case insensitive. Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

            if stdout:
                return True
            else:
                return False
```

By converting both the table name and the output to lowercase during comparison, we ensure that the check is case insensitive and resolves the test failures related to case sensitivity.

This corrected version of the `table_exists` function should address the bug reported in the failing test and the related GitHub issues.
