## Analysis:
1. The buggy function `table_exists` in the `HiveCommandClient` class is responsible for checking whether a table exists in a given database by running a Hive command.
2. The potential error locations are:
   - The comparison of the table name with the table names in the stdout is case-sensitive, leading to test failures when the case mismatches.
   - The comparison logic for checking table existence may not be handling different cases properly.
3. The cause of the bug:
   - The `table_exists` function does not handle case insensitivity when comparing the table name with the table names in the stdout. This causes the test to fail when table names are in different cases.
   - The failing test cases in the test functions provided indicate that the function is not handling case-insensitive comparisons as expected.
   - The GitHub issue (#896) highlights the need for making the `table_exists` function case-insensitive to resolve the problem reported in the failing test.
4. Strategy for fixing the bug:
   - Modify the comparison logic in the `table_exists` function to perform a case-insensitive comparison when checking the existence of the table in the stdout.
   - Update the function to convert both the table name and the table names in the stdout to lowercase for a consistent check.
5. Corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

In the corrected version, both the `table` and `stdout` are converted to lowercase before the comparison is made, making the check case-insensitive for table existence. This modification aligns with the suggested fix in GitHub issue #896.
