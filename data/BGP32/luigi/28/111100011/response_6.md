### Analysis:
- The buggy function `table_exists` in the `HiveCommandClient` class is responsible for checking if a given table exists in the specified database.
- The function uses the `run_hive_cmd` function to execute Hive commands.
- The failing test `test_table_exists` in `hive_test.py` shows that the function is failing to consider the case sensitivity when checking if a table exists.
- The GitHub issue highlights that the function should be case insensitive and compares the table name with the lowercase version of the output from Hive.
- The suggested fix is to compare `table.lower()` with `stdout.lower()` in the function.

### Bug Cause:
- The bug occurs because the `table_exists` function does a direct comparison between the provided table name and the output received from Hive without considering the case sensitivity.
- This leads to failures in test cases where the table names have different case variations.

### Fix Strategy:
- Modify the `table_exists` function to convert both the provided table name and the output from Hive to lowercase before comparing them.
- Update the function to ensure a case-insensitive check for table existence.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
    
        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
    
        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

By converting both the `table` and `stdout` to lowercase before comparison, the corrected version of the `table_exists` function should now pass the failing test case and address the issue raised on GitHub.
