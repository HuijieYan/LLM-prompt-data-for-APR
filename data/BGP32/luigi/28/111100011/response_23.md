### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `table_exists` in the `HiveCommandClient` class is responsible for checking if a given table exists in a specified database. It makes a call to the `run_hive_cmd` function.
2. The issue reported on GitHub highlights the case sensitivity problem when checking for table existence in Hive.
3. The buggy function currently does a direct comparison between the table name and the output from the Hive command, which results in case sensitivity issues.
   
### Bug Cause:
The bug occurs because the buggy function directly compares the given table name with the output from the Hive command without considering case sensitivity. This leads to failures when table names are in different cases.

### Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to modify the `table_exists` function to convert both the table name and the output from the Hive command to a consistent case before comparison. This will make the comparison case-insensitive.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd(
            f'use {database}; show partitions {table} partition ({self.partition_spec(partition)})')

        return bool(stdout)
```

In the corrected version, both the `table` and the `stdout` are converted to lowercase before comparison to make it case insensitive. This change should resolve the reported issue and ensure the function works correctly.
