## Analysis:
1. The buggy function `table_exists` in the `HiveCommandClient` class is checking for the existence of a table in a case-sensitive way which is causing the test cases to fail.
2. The related function `run_hive_cmd` is being used to run Hive commands and return the output which is then checked in the `table_exists` function.
3. The failing test cases indicate that the function is not handling case sensitivity properly, as the table names are being compared without considering case differences.
4. To fix the bug, we need to update the `table_exists` function to perform case-insensitive comparison by converting both the table name and the output to lowercase before checking for existence.


## Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Modify the `table_exists` function to convert both the table name and the output from `run_hive_cmd` to lowercase before checking for existence.
2. Update the comparisons in the function to use lowercase table names for accurate results.
3. By making the comparison case-insensitive, the function should now correctly determine the existence of a table regardless of the case used.


## Corrected Version:
```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table.lower()))
            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
        else:
            partition_str = " ".join("{0}='{1}'".format(k, v) for k, v in partition.items())
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use {0}; show partitions {1} partition ({2})""".format(database, table.lower(), partition_str))
            return bool(stdout)
``` 

By implementing these changes, the `table_exists` function should now pass the failing test cases and address the GitHub issues related to case sensitivity in table existence checks.
