The bug in the current implementation of the `table_exists` function is related to how the output of the `run_hive_cmd` function is being handled. The function is checking if the table name exists in the stdout returned by `run_hive_cmd`, but the comparison is not accurate. The condition `table in stdout` is checking if the exact string exists in the output, which may not always be the case.

To fix this bug, we can modify the comparison to check if the table name is present in a line of the output, considering that each table name is on a separate line. Additionally, we need to handle the case insensitivity for table name comparisons.

Here is the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

            return stdout and any(line.lower() == table.lower() for line in stdout.splitlines())
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

            return bool(stdout)
```

With this corrected version, the function will split the `stdout` into lines and check if the lowercase version of the table name matches any line in the output, making the comparison more accurate. This should ensure that the function passes the failing test.
