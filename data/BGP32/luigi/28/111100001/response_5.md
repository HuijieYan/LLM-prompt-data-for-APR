### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `table_exists` from the `HiveCommandClient` class is checking if a table exists in a specific database and partition. It uses the `run_hive_cmd` function to interact with Hive.
2. The bug seems to be related to how the output of the `run_hive_cmd` function is being checked in the `table_exists` function.
3. The bug occurs due to how the return value from the `run_hive_cmd` function is being compared. Specifically, in the case where the `stdout` is not empty, the function is trying to check if a table name exists in the `stdout` list directly, which is not the correct way.
4. To fix the bug, we need to properly parse the `stdout` value returned by the `run_hive_cmd` function to check if the table exists.
5. Below is the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

### Corrected Version:
```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
    
        return stdout and table in stdout.split()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                        (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
    
        return bool(stdout)
```

By splitting the `stdout` string into a list of table names in the `table_exists` function, we can correctly check if the specified table exists in the output.
