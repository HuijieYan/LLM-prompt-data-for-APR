### Analysis:
1. The `table_exists` function in the `HiveCommandClient` class is using the `run_hive_cmd` function to execute Hive commands. 
2. The bug seems to be in the conditional checks for the output of the `run_hive_cmd` function.
3. The buggy function fails because it does not correctly handle the output of the `run_hive_cmd` function for table existence checks.
4. To fix the bug, we need to modify the conditional checks to properly validate the existence of the table based on the output of the `run_hive_cmd` function.
5. The corrected version of the `table_exists` function is provided below:

### Corrected Version:
```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table)).strip()

        return stdout == table
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd(
            "use {0}; show partitions {1} partition ({2})".format(database, table, self.partition_spec(partition))
        ).strip()

        return stdout == "OK"
```

By using the `strip()` method on the `stdout` output and comparing it directly to the expected values, the corrected function ensures that the table existence checks are correctly performed and the function should now pass the failing tests.
