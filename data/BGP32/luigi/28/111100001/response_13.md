### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `table_exists` in the `HiveCommandClient` class is checking if a table exists in the specified Hive database using an SQL query.
2. The function calls `run_hive_cmd` to execute a Hive command and retrieve the output.
3. The bug in the function is related to how it checks for the existence of a table based on the output of the `run_hive_cmd` function. The logic used to check for the existence of the table is incorrect, leading to failing test cases.
4. The bug is likely caused by how the function compares the expected table name with the output of the Hive command. The comparison logic needs to be adjusted to correctly identify the existence of the table.
5. To fix the bug, we need to update the comparison logic to properly validate the existence of the table based on the output of the Hive command.

### Bug Fix:
Here is the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table in stdout.split('\n')
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s);""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        return bool(stdout.strip())
```

Changes made:
1. Added `.split('\n')` to the stdout when checking for the table name existence to compare each table name individually.
2. Added `strip()` to the stdout when checking for partition existence to remove any leading or trailing whitespaces.

By implementing these changes, the `table_exists` function should now correctly identify the existence of tables and partitions based on the output of the Hive commands.

This corrected version should now pass the failing test cases.
