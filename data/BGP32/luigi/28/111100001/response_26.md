### Analysis:
1. The `table_exists` function in the `HiveCommandClient` class is calling the `run_hive_cmd` function to execute Hive commands and check for the existence of a table. 
2. The bug seems to be related to how the function handles the output of the `run_hive_cmd` function and checks for the existence of the table.
3. The bug occurs when the function doesn't properly handle the output string from the `run_hive_cmd` function.
4. To fix the bug, we need to modify the condition where the function checks for the table existence based on the output from `run_hive_cmd`.

### Bug Fix:
Here is the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table in stdout
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables extended in {1} like "{2}" partition ({3});'.format(database, table, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        return stdout and table in stdout
```

In the corrected version, the function now correctly handles the output string from `run_hive_cmd` by checking if the table exists in the output string.

This fixed version should pass the failing test cases.
