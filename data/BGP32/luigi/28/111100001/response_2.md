1. Analysis:
The buggy function `table_exists` in the `HiveCommandClient` class is calling the `run_hive_cmd` function to run Hive commands and check if a table exists. The bug seems to lie in the logic used to determine if a table exists based on the result of running the Hive command.

2. Potential error locations:
The bug could be in the conditional checks where the function determines if the table exists based on the output of the `run_hive_cmd` function.

3. Cause of the bug:
The bug is likely due to incorrect handling of the stdout from the `run_hive_cmd` function. The function checks for the presence of the table name in the stdout but does not handle cases where the output contains additional information or formatting.

4. Strategy for fixing the bug:
To fix the bug, we need to modify how the function processes the stdout from the `run_hive_cmd` function to accurately determine if the table exists based on the provided input.

5. Corrected version of the function:
```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table in stdout.split()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        return bool(stdout)  # Check if stdout is not empty

```
In the corrected version of the `table_exists` function, we split the stdout by whitespace to get individual tokens and then check if the table name exists among those tokens. In the case of partitioned tables, we simply check if the stdout is not empty to determine if the table exists.
