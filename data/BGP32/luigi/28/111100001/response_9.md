### Analysis:
The buggy function `table_exists` in the `HiveCommandClient` class is intended to check if a given table exists in a specified database, with an optional partition. It makes use of the `run_hive_cmd` function to execute Hive commands and retrieve the output.

The bug in the function seems to be related to how the output of the Hive command is being checked. If the output is not empty and contains the table name, the function should return `True` indicating that the table exists. However, the current implementation does not handle this logic correctly, leading to incorrect results in the test cases.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is caused by the incorrect handling of the output of the Hive command in the `table_exists` function. The function expects the output to contain the table name when checking for its existence, but it does not correctly verify the presence of the table name in the output.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to modify the logic within the `table_exists` function to correctly parse the output of the Hive command and check if the table name exists in it. We should also handle cases where the table name may be preceded by other text in the output.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table in stdout
    else:
        partition_str = ' '.join(['{0}={1}'.format(k, v) for k, v in partition.items()])
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use {0}; show partitions {1} partition({2});""".format(database, table, partition_str))
        
        return stdout and partition_str in stdout
```

### Summary:
The corrected version of the `table_exists` function now correctly parses the output of the Hive command to check for the existence of the table and partition. By comparing the table name and partition string in the output, the function can accurately determine if the specified table exists. This fixed version should now pass the failing test cases.
