## Analysis:
The buggy function `table_exists` in the `HiveCommandClient` class is calling the `run_hive_cmd` function to execute Hive commands based on the parameters passed. There are two branches in the function based on whether a `partition` is provided or not. If a `partition` is provided, it calls `self.partition_spec(partition)` to get the partition specification.

## Bug:
The bug in the `table_exists` function is in the conditional check for the presence of the table name within the output of the `run_hive_cmd` function. This check is incorrect and causing the function to fail during testing.

## Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
1. Modify the conditional check to accurately determine if the table exists in the output of the `run_hive_cmd` function.
2. Ensure that the function correctly handles the case where the `partition` is provided and that the `partition_spec` function is being called correctly.

## Corrected Version:
```python
# Corrected table_exists function in HiveCommandClient class
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
        
        return stdout and table in stdout.split()
    else:
        partition_output = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
        
        return table in partition_output.split()
```

In the corrected version:
- The `stdout` output is split into a list of lines to check if the table name exists.
- The partition_output is split into a list of partitions to check if the table name exists within them.
- The corrected version will correctly handle the presence of the table name in the output of the Hive commands.

Overall, the corrected version will address the bug in the `table_exists` function.
