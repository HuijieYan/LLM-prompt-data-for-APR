### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `table_exists` in the `HiveCommandClient` class is trying to determine whether a table exists in a given database and partition.
2. The function uses the `run_hive_cmd` function to execute Hive commands and check the output to determine table existence.
3. The bug seems to be related to how the function is checking for the existence of the table and handling partitions.
4. The existing implementation is flawed in how it checks for table existence and partitions, leading to incorrect results in the tests.

### Bug Cause:
The bug in the `table_exists` function lies in how it processes the output of the `run_hive_cmd` function to determine the existence of tables and partitions. Specifically, the function does not handle the output correctly and does not accurately check for table existence in both cases (with and without partitions).

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug in the `table_exists` function, we should:
1. Ensure that the function correctly parses the output of the `run_hive_cmd` function to determine table existence.
2. Modify the condition for table existence to handle both cases of having and not having partitions.
3. Fix the logic of the function to accurately determine table existence based on the command output.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
        return stdout and table in stdout
    else:
        partition_str = ",".join(["{0}='{1}'".format(k, v) for k, v in partition.items()])
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show partitions {1} partition ({2});'.format(database, table, partition_str))
        return stdout.strip() == partition_str
```

In the corrected version:
- For tables without partitions, we simply check if the table name is present in the output.
- For tables with partitions, we construct the partition string and check if it matches the partitions present in the output.
- The corrected version accurately handles both cases and returns the correct result for table existence.
