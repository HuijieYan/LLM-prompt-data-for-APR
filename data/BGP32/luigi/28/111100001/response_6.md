### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `table_exists` within the `HiveCommandClient` class is using the `run_hive_cmd` function to check if a table exists in a given database.
2. The function has an issue with parsing the output of the `run_hive_cmd` function and checking if the table exists.
3. The bug is likely caused by the condition `stdout and table in stdout` in the first if statement. It assumes that the output will be a string with the table name if it exists, but the function `run_hive_cmd` might not always return the table name in the same format.
4. A better strategy would be to split the output by newlines and then check if the table name is in the list of split strings.
5. Below is the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

### Corrected Version:
```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
        return stdout and table in stdout.split('\n')
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
        return bool(stdout)
``` 

By splitting the `stdout` by newlines and checking if the table name is in the list, we can handle variations in the output format and fix the bug.
