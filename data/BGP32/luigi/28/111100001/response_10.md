### Analysis:
The buggy function `table_exists` in the `HiveCommandClient` class is not properly checking for the existence of a table in a Hive database. The function calls the `run_hive_cmd` function to execute a Hive command and then checks if the table exists in the output. However, the comparison logic is incorrect, leading to failing test cases.

### Identified Bug:
The bug in the `table_exists` function is in the comparison logic when checking if the `table` name exists in the `stdout` output from the `run_hive_cmd` function. The function expects the `stdout` to contain the exact table name, but it may have additional line breaks or spacing that was not accounted for in the comparison.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug in the `table_exists` function, we need to modify the comparison logic to properly check if the table name exists in the `stdout` output by ignoring any additional line breaks or spacing. We can use a more robust method for comparison, such as stripping whitespace characters from both the `table` name and the `stdout` before comparison.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
        
        return stdout and table.strip() in stdout.strip().split('\n')
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                        (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        return bool(stdout)
```

In the corrected version, we use `strip()` to remove any leading or trailing whitespace characters and then split the `stdout` output on newline characters to search for the table name in the list. This will ensure a more robust check for the existence of the table.

By making these changes, the corrected version of the `table_exists` function should now pass the failing test cases provided.
