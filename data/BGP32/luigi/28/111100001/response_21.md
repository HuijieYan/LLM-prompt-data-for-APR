### Analysis:
The buggy function `table_exists` in the `HiveCommandClient` class is using the `run_hive_cmd` function to run Hive commands and check if a table exists. The bug seems to be related to how the function handles checking if a table exists with partitions.

### Potential Error Location:
The bug may be present in the logic related to checking table existence with partitions in the `table_exists` function.

### Cause of the Bug:
The bug in the `table_exists` function is related to how the function processes the stdout from the `run_hive_cmd` function when checking for table existence with partitions. The current implementation does not handle the output correctly, leading to incorrect results when checking for table existence with partitions.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the function correctly handles the stdout from the `run_hive_cmd` function, especially when checking for table existence with partitions. We may need to modify the logic within the `table_exists` function to handle partitioned table checks properly.

### Corrected Version:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
        return stdout and table in stdout
    else:
        partition_str = ', '.join(['{}="{}"'.format(k, v) for k, v in partition.items()])
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show partitions {1} partition ({2});'.format(database, table, partition_str))
        return stdout and partition_str in stdout
```

This corrected version of the `table_exists` function will handle checking for table existence with partitions correctly by constructing the partition string and then checking if the specific partition exists in the stdout output from the `run_hive_cmd` function. The corrected version should now pass the failing test cases.
