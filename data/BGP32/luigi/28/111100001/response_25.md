### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `table_exists` in the `HiveCommandClient` class is using the `run_hive_cmd` function to check if a table exists in a given database with optional partition information.
2. The bug seems to be related to how the function checks if the table exists. The function checks if the table name is present in the output of the `run_hive_cmd` function, but the comparison logic is incorrect.

### Bug Explanation:
- In the `table_exists` function, the bug is in the line `return stdout and table in stdout`.
- When `stdout` is the empty string, the logic `stdout and table in stdout` evaluates to `False and False`, resulting in `False`, even if the table exists. This causes the failing test cases where an empty string is returned.
- Similarly, the logic to check for the existence of the table when there is partition information is also incorrect, as it only checks if `stdout` is not `None`, which may not always indicate the existence of the table.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
- Update the logic in the `table_exists` function to correctly check if the table exists in the output of `run_hive_cmd`.
- Check for the presence of the table name in the output string, rather than relying on logical operations with the `stdout` value.
- Handle the scenarios where the output is an empty string or `None` differently to accurately determine the existence of the table.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
        return stdout and (table in stdout.split('\n'))
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
        if stdout:
            # Check if the table exists in the partitions list
            return any(table in line for line in stdout.split('\n'))
        return False
```

After applying these changes, the corrected version of the `table_exists` function should pass the failing test cases.
