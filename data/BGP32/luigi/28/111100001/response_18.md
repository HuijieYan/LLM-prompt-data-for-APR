### Analysis:
The buggy function `table_exists` in the `HiveCommandClient` class is checking if a table exists in a database by running a `hive` command and parsing the output. The bug seems to be related to the condition checking for the table existence based on the output of the `run_hive_cmd` function.

### Potential Error Locations:
1. The `table_exists` function may not be processing the output of the `run_hive_cmd` function correctly.
2. The condition for checking if the table exists or not might be erroneous.

### Cause of the Bug:
The bug in the `table_exists` function arises from the incorrect interpretation of the output of the `run_hive_cmd` function. The function expects to find the table name in the output to determine if the table exists. However, due to incorrect parsing or comparison, the function might not be able to accurately identify the table existence.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the `table_exists` function correctly processes the output of the `run_hive_cmd` function and accurately determines the existence of the table based on that output. This might involve correcting the condition for checking table existence and potentially adjusting how the output is processed.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
        return stdout and table in stdout
    else:
        partition_spec = self.partition_spec(partition)
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show partitions {1} partition ({2});'.format(database, table, partition_spec))
        return stdout.strip() != ""
```

In the corrected version:
- I have added a `strip()` method to the `stdout` before checking for an empty string to handle any extra whitespace or newline characters.
- I have fixed the incorrect formatting in the output command when checking for partitions.

This corrected version should address the bug in the `table_exists` function.
