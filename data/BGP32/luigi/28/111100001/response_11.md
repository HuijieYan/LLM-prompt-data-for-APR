### Analysis:
- The `table_exists` function in the `HiveCommandClient` class is checking if a given table exists in a Hive database by running a hive command.
- The function makes use of the `run_hive_cmd` function to execute hive commands.
- The bug seems to be related to the handling of the stdout output from the `run_hive_cmd` function.

### Error Location:
- The bug is likely in the conditional checks in the function where it evaluates the `stdout`.

### Cause of the Bug:
- The bug occurs because the function is incorrectly evaluating the stdout to determine if the table exists or not.
- It is not properly handling the case where the table name is included in the stdout along with other information.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
- We need to modify the condition where we check if the table name is in the stdout to ensure that it handles cases where there may be additional information in the stdout.
- We should split the stdout by newline character and check if the table name is in the list of lines.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
        
        return stdout and table in stdout.split('\n')
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
        
        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

By splitting the `stdout` by newline character when checking if the table exists, we can accurately determine if the table name is present in the output. This modification should address the bug and make the function behave correctly.
