Upon analyzing the buggy function `table_exists` and its related class `HiveCommandClient`, we can identify a potential issue causing the bug in the function. The function calls the `run_hive_cmd` function with specific queries to check for the existence of a table and its partitions. 

The bug in the function lies in the condition where it checks if the `stdout` variable is not empty to determine if the table exists. In the case where the `run_hive_cmd` returns "OK\nmytable", the function does not properly process the output and incorrectly evaluates it. 

To fix this bug, we need to modify the function to properly parse the output of `run_hive_cmd` and check for the table name within the result. Additionally, the function should handle cases where the output contains multiple lines or extra characters.

Here is the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
    
        return stdout and table in stdout.split('\n')  # Check for table in each line of stdout
    else:
        query = """use {0}; show partitions {1} partition ({2})""".format(database, table, self.partition_spec(partition))
        stdout = run_hive_cmd(query)
    
        if stdout and 'OK' not in stdout:  # Check if partition exists
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

With these changes, the function should now properly handle the different output scenarios and pass the failing test cases.
