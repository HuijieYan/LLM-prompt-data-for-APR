### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `table_exists` in the `HiveCommandClient` class checks if a table exists in a given database with an optional partition.
2. The function calls `run_hive_cmd` to execute Hive commands based on the inputs provided.
3. The buggy function fails the test `test_table_exists` because it does not handle the case where the table name appears in the middle of the output from `run_hive_cmd`.
4. The bug occurs because the function checks if the exact table name matches the entire output which fails when the table name is in the middle of the output.
5. The bug can be fixed by splitting the output from `run_hive_cmd` into lines and checking if the table name is in any of the lines.

### Bug Fix:
```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
            return stdout and table in stdout.split("\n")
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                                    (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
            return any([table in line for line in stdout.split("\n")])
```

By splitting the output from `run_hive_cmd` into lines and then checking if the table name is in any of the lines, we ensure that the function correctly detects the existence of the table, even if it appears in the middle of the output.
