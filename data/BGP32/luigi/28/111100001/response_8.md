### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `table_exists` in the `HiveCommandClient` class makes calls to the `run_hive_cmd` function to check if a table exists in a database.
2. The bug seems to be caused by incorrect handling of the output received from the `run_hive_cmd` function.
3. The failing test `test_table_exists` in `hive_test.py` is mocking the `run_hive_cmd` function but the buggy function is not correctly handling the output leading to test failures.
4. To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the `table_exists` function correctly interprets the output from `run_hive_cmd` function and returns the appropriate boolean value.

### Strategy for fixing the bug:
1. Modify the `table_exists` function to properly check for the presence of the table name in the output received from the `run_hive_cmd`.
2. Handle both cases where the table name is present in the output and where it is not present.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

            return stdout and table in stdout
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                                (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

            return stdout != ""
```

By updating the `table_exists` function to return `stdout != ""` in the else block, we ensure it returns `True` if the output is not empty (indicating the table exists) and `False` otherwise. This change should fix the bug and make the function pass the failing tests.
