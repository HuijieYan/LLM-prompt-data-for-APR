### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `table_exists` is part of the `HiveCommandClient` class, which is a subclass of `HiveClient`.
2. The function calls `run_hive_cmd` to execute Hive commands.
3. The bug occurs because the function incorrectly checks for the presence of the table name in the output of the Hive command. The condition `stdout and table in stdout` does not accurately determine if the table exists.
4. To fix the bug, we need to implement a more robust check to verify the existence of the table in the Hive output.

### Bug Cause:
The bug in the `table_exists` function lies in the conditional check `stdout and table in stdout`. This condition does not handle all cases where the table may or may not exist in the Hive output. It fails to account for scenarios where the table name is present in the output but not exactly matching, leading to incorrect results.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to modify the logic for checking the existence of the table in the Hive output. One approach is to split the lines in the stdout and compare each line with the table name. If there is an exact match, then the table exists; otherwise, it does not.

### Corrected Version:

```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
    
            if stdout:
                tables = stdout.split('\n')
                for t in tables:
                    if t.strip() == table:
                        return True
                return False
            else:
                return False
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                                (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
    
            if stdout:
                return True
            else:
                return False
```

Now, the corrected version of the `table_exists` function includes a more reliable way of checking for the existence of the table in the Hive output by splitting the lines and comparing each table name individually. This should address the bug and ensure the function behaves correctly.
